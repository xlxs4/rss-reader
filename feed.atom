 Abstract. We present a geometric Melnikov method to analyze a two-dimensional stable or unstable manifold associated with a saddle point in three-dimensional nonvolume preserving autonomous flows. The time-varying perturbed location of such a manifold is obtained under very general, nonvolume preserving and with arbitrary time-dependence, perturbations. We demonstrate the explicit computability of the leading-order spatio-temporal location of the manifold using our formulas. In unperturbed situations with a two-dimensional heteroclinic manifold, we adapt our theory to quantify the splitting into a stable and unstable manifold, and thereby obtain an instantaneous flux quantification in terms of a Melnikov function. The time-varying instantaneous flux theory does not require any intersections between perturbed manifolds, nor rely on descriptions of lobe dynamics. Our theory has specific application to transport in fluid mechanics, where the flow is in three dimensions and flow separators in forward/backward time are two-dimensional stable/unstable manifolds. We demonstrate our theory using both the classical and swirling versions of Hill’s spherical vortex.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we extend a recently established subgradient method for the computation of Riemannian metrics that optimizes certain singular value functions associated with dynamical systems. This extension is threefold. First, we introduce a projected subgradient method which results in Riemannian metrics whose parameters are confined to a compact convex set and we can thus prove that a minimizer exists; second, we allow inexact subgradients and study the effect of the errors on the computed metrics; and third, we analyze the subgradient algorithm for three different choices of step sizes: constant, exogenous, and Polyak. The new methods are illustrated by application to dimension and entropy estimation of the Hénon map.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We typically interact in groups, not just in pairs. For this reason, it has recently been proposed that the spread of information, opinion, or disease should be modeled over a hypergraph rather than a standard graph. The use of hyperedges naturally allows for a nonlinear rate of transmission, in terms of both the group size and the number of infected group members, as is the case, for example, when social distancing is encouraged. We consider a general class of individual-level, stochastic, susceptible-infected-susceptible models on a hypergraph, and focus on a mean field approximation proposed in [G. F. de Arruda, G. Petri, and Y. Moreno, Phys. Rev. Res., 2 (2020), 023032]. We derive spectral conditions under which the mean field model predicts local or global stability of the infection-free state. We also compare these results with (a) a new condition that we derive for decay to zero in mean for the exact process, (b) conditions for a different mean field approximation in [D. J. Higham and H.-L. de Kergorlay, Proc. A, 477 (2021), 20210232], and (c) numerical simulations of the microscale model.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In a general stochastic multistate promoter model of dynamic messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)/protein interactions, we identify the stationary joint distribution of the promoter state, mRNA, and protein levels through an explicit “stick-breaking" construction perhaps of interest in itself. This derivation is a constructive advance over previous work where the stationary distribution is solved only in restricted cases. Moreover, the stick-breaking construction allows us to sample directly from the stationary distribution, permitting inference procedures and model selection. In this context, we discuss numerical Bayesian experiments to illustrate the results.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We consider a jump-diffusion process on a bounded domain with reflection at the boundary and establish long-term results for a general additive process of its path. This includes the long-term behavior of its occupation time in the interior and on the boundaries. We derive a characterization of the large deviation rate function which quantifies the rate of exponential decay of probabilities of rare events for paths of the process. The characterization relies on a solution of a partial integro-differential equation with boundary constraints. We develop a practical implementation of our results in terms of a numerical solution for the PIDE. We illustrate the method on a few standard examples (Brownian motion, birth-death processes) and on a particular jump-diffusion model arising from applications to biochemical reactions.]]></summary>

Since NRPS are not limited to the incorporation of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, their efficient manipulation would allow the biotechnological generation of complex peptides including linear, cyclic and further modified natural product analogues, e.g. to optimise natural product leads. Here we describe a detailed phylogenetic analysis of several bacterial NRPS that led to the identification of a new recombination breakpoint within the thiolation (T) domain that is important for natural NRPS evolution. From this, an evolution-inspired eXchange Unit between T domains (XUT) approach was developed which allows the assembly of NRPS fragments over a broad range of GC contents, protein similarities, and extender unit specificities, as demonstrated for the specific production of a proteasome inhibitor designed and assembled from five different NRPS fragments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Phylogenetic networks extend phylogenetic trees to model non-vertical inheritance, by which a lineage inherits material from multiple parents. The computational complexity of estimating phylogenetic networks from genome-wide data with likelihood-based methods limits the size of networks that can be handled. Methods based on pairwise distances could offer faster alternatives. We study here the information that average pairwise distances contain on the underlying phylogenetic network, by characterizing local and global features that can or cannot be identified. For general networks, we clarify that the root and edge lengths adjacent to reticulations are not identifiable, and then focus on the class of zipped-up semidirected networks. We provide a criterion to swap subgraphs locally, such as 3-cycles, resulting in indistinguishable networks. We propose the “distance split tree”, which can be constructed from pairwise distances, and prove that it is a refinement of the network’s tree of blobs, capturing the tree-like features of the network. For level-1 networks, this distance split tree is equal to the tree of blobs refined to separate polytomies from blobs, and we prove that the mixed representation of the network is identifiable. The information loss is localized around 4-cycles, for which the placement of the reticulation is unidentifiable. The mixed representation combines split edges for 4-cycles, regular tree and hybrid edges from the semidirected network, and edge parameters that encode all information identifiable from average pairwise distances.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genome editing requires precision to broadly move on to industrial and clinical applications. For this reason, homologous directed repair (HDR) is one of the preferred methods for small edits, other than knock-outs. However, HDR has low efficiency. Current investigations to enhance HDR have mainly gone in the direction of finding non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) inhibitors. NHEJ is crucial for cellular integrity, then the inhibition of this pathway is detrimental for the correct survival of living entities. In other studies, a second opportunity is given to HDR by targeting the byproducts of NHEJ, using an extra gRNA. In this study, we propose the use of a meiotic factor, PRDM9, to directly enhance homology recombination. Through the exploration of combinatorial factors and donor design, we have established an optimized protocol for HDR. PRDM9-Cas9 fusion combined with CtIP improves HDR/NHEJ ratio. In addition, we have validated this combinatorial approach for small edits through a traffic light reporter system, as well as for longer edits with a split-GFP reporter system.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To probe signal propagation and genetic actuation in microbial consortia, we have coopted the components of both redox and quorum sensing (QS) signaling into a communication network for guiding composition by "programming" cell lysis. Here, we use an electrode to generate hydrogen peroxide as a redox cue that determines consortia composition. The oxidative stress regulon of Escherichia coli, OxyR, is employed to receive and transform this signal into a QS signal that coordinates the lysis of a subpopulation of cells. We examine a suite of information transfer modalities including "monoculture" and "transmitter-receiver" models, as well as a series of genetic circuits that introduce time-delays for altering information relay, thereby expanding design space. A simple mathematical model aids in developing communication schemes that accommodate the transient nature of redox signals and the "collective" attributes of QS signals. We suggest this platform methodology will be useful in understanding and controlling synthetic microbial consortia for a variety of applications, including biomanufacturing and biocontainment.]]></summary>

However, its mechanism remains poorly understood, which also impedes its application as a cell-division machinery for synthetic cells. Here, we use fluorescence microscopy and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) to study the in vitro reconstitution of the bacterial protein Dynamin A (DynA) inside liposomes. Upon external reshaping of the liposomes into dumbbells, DynA self-assembles at the membrane neck, resulting in membrane hemi-scission and even full scission. DynA proteins constitute a simple one-component division machinery that is capable of splitting dumbbell-shaped liposomes, marking an important step towards building a synthetic cell.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Recent progress in nanotechnology-enabled sensors that can be placed inside of living plants has shown that it is possible to relay and record real-time chemical signaling stimulated by various abiotic and biotic stresses. The mathematical form of the resulting local reactive oxygen species (ROS) wave released upon mechanical perturbation of plant leaves appears to be conserved across a large number of species, and produces a distinct waveform from other stresses including light, heat and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-induced stresses. Herein, we develop a quantitative theory of the local ROS signaling waveform resulting from mechanical stress in planta. We show that nonlinear, autocatalytic production and Fickian diffusion of H2O2 followed by first order decay well describes the spatial and temporal properties of the waveform. The reaction–diffusion system is analyzed in terms of a new approximate solution that we introduce for such problems based on a single term logistic function ansatz. The theory is able to describe experimental ROS waveforms and degradation dynamics such that species-dependent dimensionless wave velocities are revealed, corresponding to subtle changes in higher moments of the waveform through an apparently conserved signaling mechanism overall. This theory has utility in potentially decoding other stress signaling waveforms for light, heat and PAMP-induced stresses that are similarly under investigation. The approximate solution may also find use in applied agricultural sensing, facilitating the connection between measured waveform and plant physiology.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In resource-limited settings, it can be difficult to safely deliver sensitive biologic medicines to patients due to cold chain and infrastructure constraints. Point-of-care drug manufacturing could circumvent these challenges because medicines could be produced locally and used on-demand. Towards this vision, we combine cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) and a 2-in-1 affinity purification and enzymatic cleavage scheme to develop a platform for point-of-care drug manufacturing. As a model, we use this platform to synthesize a panel of peptide hormones, an important class of medications that can be used to treat a wide variety of diseases including diabetes, osteoporosis, and growth disorders. With this approach, temperature-stable lyophilized CFPS reaction components can be rehydrated with DNA encoding a SUMOylated peptide hormone of interest when needed. Strep-Tactin(R) affinity purification and on-bead SUMO protease cleavage yields peptide hormones in their native form that are recognized by ELISA antibodies and that can bind their respective receptors. With further development to ensure proper biologic activity and patient safety, we envision this platform could be used to manufacture valuable peptide hormone drugs at the point-of-care in resource-limited settings.]]></summary>

Inference of species networks from genomic data under the Network Multispecies Coalescent Model is currently severely limited by heavy computational demands. It also remains unclear how complicated networks can be for consistent inference to be possible. As a step toward inferring a general species network, this work considers its tree of blobs, in which non-cut edges are contracted to nodes, so only tree-like relationships between the taxa are shown. An identifiability theorem, that most features of the unrooted tree of blobs can be determined from the distribution of gene quartet topologies, is established. This depends upon an analysis of gene quartet concordance factors under the model, together with a new combinatorial inference rule. The arguments for this theoretical result suggest a practical algorithm for tree of blobs inference, to be fully developed in a subsequent work.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we study the generalized multiscale finite element method (GMsFEM) for single phase compressible flow in highly heterogeneous porous media. We follow the major steps of the GMsFEM to construct a permeability dependent offline basis for fast coarse-grid simulation. The offline coarse space is efficiently constructed only once based on the initial permeability field with parallel computing. A rigorous convergence analysis is performed for two types of snapshot spaces. The analysis indicates that the convergence rates of the proposed multiscale method depend on the coarse meshsize and the eigenvalue decay of the local spectral problem. To further increase the accuracy of the multiscale method, a residual driven online multiscale basis is added to the offline space. The construction of an online multiscale basis is based on a carefully designed error indicator motivated by the analysis. We find that an online basis is particularly important for the singular source. Rich numerical tests on typical 3D highly heterogeneous media are presented to demonstrate the impressive computational advantages of the proposed multiscale method.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Small-scale features of shallow water flow obtained from direct numerical simulation (DNS) with two different computational codes for the shallow water equations are gathered offline and subsequently employed with the aim of constructing a reduced-order correction. This is used to facilitate high-fidelity online flow predictions at much reduced costs on coarse meshes. The resolved small-scale features at high resolution represent subgrid properties for the coarse representation. Measurements of the subgrid dynamics are obtained as the difference between the evolution of a coarse grid solution and the corresponding DNS result. The measurements are sensitive to the particular numerical methods used for the simulation on coarse computational grids and can be used to approximately correct the associated discretization errors. The subgrid features are decomposed into empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), after which a corresponding correction term is constructed. By increasing the number of EOFs in the approximation of the measured values the correction term can in principle be made arbitrarily accurate. Both computational methods investigated here show a significant decrease in the simulation error already when applying the correction based on the dominant EOFs only. The error reduction accounts for the particular discretization errors that are incurred and are hence specific to the particular simulation method that is adopted. This improvement is also observed for very coarse grids, which may be used for computational model reduction in geophysical and turbulent flow problems.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Triadic closure describes the tendency for new friendships to form between individuals who already have friends in common. It has been argued heuristically that the triadic closure effect can lead to bistability in the formation of large-scale social interaction networks. Here, depending on the initial state and the transient dynamics, the system may evolve towards either of two long-time states. In this work, we propose and study a hierarchy of network evolution models that incorporate triadic closure, building on the work of Grindrod, Higham, and Parsons [Internet Math., 8 (2012), pp. 402–423]. We use a chemical kinetics framework, paying careful attention to the reaction rate scaling with respect to the system size. In a macroscale regime, we show rigorously that a bimodal steady state distribution is admitted. This behavior corresponds to the existence of two distinct stable fixed points in a deterministic mean-field ODE. The macroscale model is also seen to capture an apparent metastability property of the microscale system. Computational simulations are used to support the analysis.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This article examines the homogenization issue for the Stokes system in a domain with an oscillating boundary portion. On the oscillating boundary, we impose inhomogeneous oscillating Dirichlet boundary data. The proposed method is an attempt to develop the homogenization technique for the nonstationary Stokes system on noncylindrical domains. To resolve the uniform bound of solutions with respect to heterogeneous parameters, we transform the system into a reference domain and demonstrate its existence and uniqueness in the reference domain. In order to homogenize the velocity and pressure in the reference domain, two-scale convergence is employed. In contrast to all other available homogenization techniques, the one presented in this work is easily adaptable to evolving domains. We also establish error estimates for the homogenized system approximation by transforming the system into its initial configuration.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This study constructs a new diffuse-domain (DD) lattice Boltzmann (LB) method for two-phase flows in complex geometries. We first coupled the DD method with the consistent and conservative phase-field (CCPF) method which can be described by the DD-CC Navier–Stokes–Cahn–Hilliard (NSCH) equations with the consistency of reduction, the consistency of mass and momentum transport, and the consistency of mass conservation. Then we conducted a matched asymptotic analysis and found that the DD-CCNSCH equations would converge to the CCNSCH equations as the thickness of the DD interface approaches to zero. Since the boundary conditions imposed on the complex geometries are incorporated into the DD-CCNSCH equations as the source terms, the system can be implemented more readily in a large and regular domain, and there is no need to treat the complex boundary conditions specially. We further developed a DD-CCPFLB method, and through the Chapman–Enskog analysis, the DD-CCPFLB method can correctly recover the DD-CCNSCH equations for two-phase flows in complex geometries. To quantitatively validate the DD-CCPFLB method, three benchmark problems are considered, and the numerical results are in agreement with those obtained through directly solving the CCNSCH equations combined with the original boundary conditions, the analytical solution, or the reported data. Finally, the present method is used to study the problems of two-phase flows in complex geometries, including the droplet dynamics in the Y-shaped channel and a droplet passing through cylindrical obstacles. The effects of the wettability and viscosity ratio are mainly investigated, and it is found that these two factors have significant impacts on the droplet dynamics.]]></summary>

We first introduce a single neuron model taking the UPR mechanism into account. We investigate it and propose a stability study among which a bifurcation analysis with respect to three of its parameters. Then, we generalize it to two neurons showing PrP[math] proteins interaction. Stability results are given when neurons exhibit identical parameters but interact differently (strong, weak, or no interaction).]]></summary>

 Abstract. Koopman operator theory has gained interest in the past decade as a framework for rigorously transforming nonlinear dynamics on the state space into linear dynamics on Koopman-invariant function spaces. These Koopman-invariant spaces can be approximated purely through data-driven methodologies, which then enables future state prediction and the application of classical linear control to strongly nonlinear systems. Recently in literature, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) was developed for systems represented through eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator. However, the controller was limited to using real-valued eigenfunctions for conservative systems. In this paper, we extend the Koopman LQR framework to use multiple complex eigenfunctions. We illustrate in several examples that our proposed extension enables Koopman LQR to control dissipative systems and to drive different nonlinear oscillators to stabilize at nonequilibrium points and follow arbitrarily prescribed targets, which was not possible using a single real-valued Koopman eigenfunction.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Periodic waves of the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation are identified in the context of a new variational problem with two constraints. The advantage of this variational problem is that its nondegenerate local minimizers are stable in the time evolution of the mKdV equation, whereas the saddle points are unstable. We explore the analytical representation of periodic waves given by Jacobi elliptic functions and compute numerically critical points of the constrained variational problem. A broken pitchfork bifurcation of three smooth solution families is found. Two families represent (stable) minimizers of the constrained variational problem and one family represents (unstable) saddle points.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We analyze a family of clustered excitatory-inhibitory neural networks and the underlying bifurcation structures that arise because of permutation symmetries in the network as the global coupling strength [math] is varied. We primarily consider two network topologies: an all-to-all connected network which excludes self-connections, and a network in which the excitatory cells are broken into clusters of equal size. Although in both cases the bifurcation structure is determined by symmetries in the system, the behavior of the two systems is qualitatively different. In the all-to-all connected network, the system undergoes Hopf bifurcations leading to periodic orbit solutions; notably, for large [math], there is a single, stable periodic orbit solution and no stable fixed points. By contrast, in the clustered network, there are no Hopf bifurcations, and there is a family of stable fixed points for large [math].]]></summary>

 Abstract. Localized persistent cortical neural activity is a validated neural substrate of parametric working memory. Such activity “bumps” represent the continuous location of a cue over several seconds. Pyramidal (excitatory (E)) and interneuronal (inhibitory (I)) subpopulations exhibit tuned bumps of activity, linking neural dynamics to behavioral inaccuracies observed in memory recall. However, many bump attractor models collapse these subpopulations into a single joint E/I(lateral inhibitory) population and do not consider the role of interpopulation neural architecture and noise correlations. Both factors have a high potential to impinge upon the stochastic dynamics of these bumps, ultimately shaping behavioral response variance. In our study, we consider a neural field model with separate E/I populations and leverage asymptotic analysis to derive a nonlinear Langevin system describing E/I bump interactions. While the E bump attracts the I bump, the I bump stabilizes but can also repel the E bump, which can result in prolonged relaxation dynamics when both bumps are perturbed. Furthermore, the structure of noise correlations within and between subpopulations strongly shapes the variance in bump position. Surprisingly, higher interpopulation correlations reduce variance.]]></summary>

Nonlinear complex network-coupled systems typically have multiple stable equilibrium states. Following perturbations or due to ambient noise, the system is pushed away from its initial equilibrium, and, depending on the direction and the amplitude of the excursion, it might undergo a transition to another equilibrium. It was recently demonstrated [M. Tyloo, J. Phys. Complex. 3 03LT01 (2022)] that layered complex networks may exhibit amplified fluctuations. Here, I investigate how noise with system-specific correlations impacts the first escape time of nonlinearly coupled oscillators. Interestingly, I show that, not only the strong amplification of the fluctuations is a threat to the good functioning of the network but also the spatial and temporal correlations of the noise along the lowest-lying eigenmodes of the Laplacian matrix. I analyze first escape times on synthetic networks and compare noise originating from layered dynamics to uncorrelated noise.]]></summary>

The box-covering method plays a fundamental role in the fractal property recognition and renormalization analysis of complex networks. This study proposes the hub-collision avoidance and leaf-node options (HALO) algorithm. In the box sampling process, a forward sampling rule (for avoiding hub collisions) and a reverse sampling rule (for preferentially selecting leaf nodes) are determined for bidirectional network traversal to reduce the randomness of sampling. In the box selection process, the larger necessary boxes are preferentially selected to join the solution by continuously removing small boxes. The compact-box-burning (CBB) algorithm, the maximum-excluded-mass-burning (MEMB) algorithm, the overlapping-box-covering (OBCA) algorithm, and the algorithm for combining small-box-removal strategy and maximum box sampling with a sampling density of 30 (SM30)  are compared with HALO in experiments. Results on nine real networks show that HALO achieves the highest performance score and obtains 11.40%, 7.67%, 2.18%, and 8.19% fewer boxes than the compared algorithms, respectively. The algorithm determinism is significantly improved. The fractal dimensions estimated by covering four standard networks are more accurate. Moreover, different from MEMB or OBCA, HALO is not affected by the tightness of the hubs and exhibits a stable performance in different networks. Finally, the time complexities of HALO and the compared algorithms are all [math], which is reasonable and acceptable.]]></summary>

Robotic tasks often exceed the scope of steady-state or periodic behavior, which necessitates generally-applicable models of actuators intended to generate transient or aperiodic motion. However, existing electromechanical models of servomotors typically omit consideration of the switching power converter circuits required for directional, speed, or torque control. In this study, a multi-domain framework is established for switched electromechanical dynamics in servomotor systems for their analysis and control in general aperiodic tasks including transient phases. The switched electromechanical dynamics is derived from the individual models of the internal DC motor, gear train, and H-bridge circuit. The coupled models comprehensively integrate all possible distinct switching configurations of on-state, off-state, and dead time. A combination of cycle averaging with piecewise analytical solutions of the non-smooth dynamics is introduced to handle different temporal scales from high-frequency electrical to low-frequency mechanical variables. System parameters were estimated from experimental data using a dual-servomotor test platform. The model was validated for predictive accuracy against measured data in two distinct tasks—dynamic braking of a pendulum system and sinusoidal trajectory following. The model was also used to formulate the servomotor power consumption, which was implemented for optimal control demonstration and energy analysis. In particular, the servomotor power consumption model provided true optimality (minimization) when compared with the squared rotor torque and the positive rotor mechanical power that are commonly used as proxy models. While the focus of this work is on permanent-magnet, armature-controlled brushed DC servomotors, the approach is applicable to general electromechanical systems with switching-based control.]]></summary>

This work aims to expand an epidemiological non-local model that successfully described the French riots of 2005 to incorporate the topology of Santiago’s subway network and explain the reported distribution of rioting activity in the city. Although the model reproduced the disorders’ aggregated temporal evolution, it could not deliver results resembling the observed spatial distribution of activity on Santiago. The main reason for this failure can be attributed to the fact that the model lacks a population displacement mechanism, which seems vital to explain Santiago’s unrest episodes.]]></summary>

The Watts–Strogatz networks are important models that interpolate between regular lattices and random graphs, and Barabási–Albert networks are famous models that explain the origin of the scale-free networks. Here, we consider the first encounters between two particles (e.g., prey A and predator B) embedded in the Watts–Strogatz networks and the Barabási–Albert networks. We address numerically the mean first-encounter time (MFET) while the two particles are moving and the mean first-passage time (MFPT) while the prey is fixed, aiming at uncovering the impact of the prey’s motion on the encounter time, and the conditions where the motion of the prey would accelerate (or slow) the encounter between the two particles. Different initial conditions are considered. In the case where the two particles start independently from sites that are selected randomly from the stationary distribution, on the Barabási–Albert networks, the MFET is far less than the MFPT, and the impact of prey’s motion on the encounter time is enormous, whereas, on the Watts–Strogatz networks (including Erdős-Rényi random networks), the MFET is about 0.5–1 times the MFPT, and the impact of prey’s motion on the encounter time is relatively small. We also consider the case where prey A starts from a fixed site and the predator starts from a randomly drawn site and present the conditions where the motion of the prey would accelerate (or slow) the encounter between the two particles. The relation between the MFET (or MFPT) and the average path length is also discussed.]]></summary>

Predictive states for stochastic processes are a nonparametric and interpretable construct with relevance across a multitude of modeling paradigms. Recent progress on the self-supervised reconstruction of predictive states from time-series data focused on the use of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Here, we examine how Wasserstein distances may be used to detect predictive equivalences in symbolic data. We compute Wasserstein distances between distributions over sequences (“predictions”) using a finite-dimensional embedding of sequences based on the Cantor set for the underlying geometry. We show that exploratory data analysis using the resulting geometry via hierarchical clustering and dimension reduction provides insight into the temporal structure of processes ranging from the relatively simple (e.g., generated by finite-state hidden Markov models) to the very complex (e.g., generated by infinite-state indexed grammars).]]></summary>

We study the extreme transient dynamics of four self-excited pendula coupled via the movable beam. A slight difference in the pendula lengths induces the appearance of traveling phase behavior, within which the oscillators synchronize, but the phases between the nodes change in time. We discuss various scenarios of traveling states (involving different pendula) and their properties, comparing them with classical synchronization patterns of phase-locking. The research investigates the problem of transient dynamics preceding the stabilization of the network on a final synchronous attractor, showing that the width of transient windows can become extremely long. The relation between the behavior of the system within the transient regime and its initial conditions is examined and described. Our results include both identical and non-identical pendula masses, showing that the distribution of the latter ones is related to the transients. The research performed in this paper underlines possible transient problems occurring during the analysis of the systems when the slow evolution of the dynamics can be misinterpreted as the final behavior.]]></summary>

Splay states of the amplitude envelope are stably observed as a heterogenous node is introduced into the globally coupled identical oscillators with repulsive coupling. With the increment of the frequency mismatches between the heterogenous nodes and the rest identical globally coupled oscillators, the formal stable splay state based on the time series becomes unstable, while a splay state based on the new-born amplitude envelopes of time series is stably observed among the rest identical oscillators. The characteristics of the splay state based on the amplitude envelope are numerically and theoretically presented for different parameters of the coupling strength [math] and the frequency mismatches [math] for small coupling strength and large frequency mismatches. We expect that all these results could reveal the generality of splay states in coupled nonidentical oscillators and help to understand the rich dynamics of amplitude envelopes in multidisciplinary fields.]]></summary>

Population dynamics and evolutionary genetics underly the structure of ecosystems, changing on the same timescale for interacting species with rapid turnover, such as virus (e.g. HIV) and immune response. Thus, an important problem in mathematical modeling is to connect ecology, evolution and genetics, which often have been treated separately. Here, extending analysis of multiple virus and immune response populations in a resource—prey (consumer)—predator model from Browne and Smith (2018), we show that long term dynamics of viral mutants evolving resistance at distinct epitopes (viral proteins targeted by immune responses) are governed by epistasis in the virus fitness landscape. In particular, the stability of persistent equilibrium virus-immune (prey-predator) network structures, such as nested and one-to-one, and bifurcations are determined by a collection of circuits defined by combinations of viral fitnesses that are minimally additive within a hypercube of binary sequences representing all possible viral epitope sequences ordered according to immunodominance hierarchy. Numerical solutions of our ordinary differential equation system, along with an extended stochastic version including random mutation, demonstrate how pairwise or multiplicative epistatic interactions shape viral evolution against concurrent immune responses and convergence to the multi-variant steady state predicted by theoretical results. Furthermore, simulations illustrate how periodic infusions of subdominant immune responses can induce a bifurcation in the persistent viral strains, offering superior host outcome over an alternative strategy of immunotherapy with strongest immune response.]]></summary>

The interferential current (IFC) therapy is a noninvasive electrical neurostimulation technique intended to activate deep neurons using surface electrodes. In IFC, two independent kilohertz-frequency currents purportedly intersect where an interference field is generated. However, the effects of IFC on neurons within and outside the interference field are not completely understood, and it is unclear whether this technique can reliable activate deep target neurons without side effects. In recent years, realistic computational models of IFC have been introduced to quantify the effects of IFC on brain cells, but they are often complex and computationally costly. Here, we introduce a simplified model of IFC based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model of a neuron. By considering a modified averaging method, we obtain a non-autonomous approximated system, with explicit representation of relevant IFC parameters. For this approximated system we determine conditions under which it reliably approximates the complete FHN system under IFC stimulation, and we mathematically prove its ability to predict nonspiking states. In addition, we perform numerical simulations that show that the interference effect is observed only for a narrow set of IFC parameters and, in particular, for a beat frequency no higher than about 100 [Hz]. Our novel model tailored to the IFC technique contributes to the understanding of neurostimulation modalities using this type of signals, and can have implications in the design of noninvasive electrical stimulation therapies.]]></summary>

In this paper, we solve nonlinear conservation laws using the radial basis function generated finite difference (RBF-FD) method. Nonlinear conservation laws have solutions that entail strong discontinuities and shocks, which give rise to numerical instabilities when the solution is approximated by a numerical method. We introduce a residual-based artificial viscosity (RV) stabilization framework adjusted to the RBF-FD method, where the residual of the conservation law adaptively locates discontinuities and shocks. The RV stabilization framework is applied to the collocation RBF-FD method and the oversampled RBF-FD method. Computational tests confirm that the stabilized methods are reliable and accurate in solving scalar conservation laws and conservation law systems such as compressible Euler equations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Significant past work has characterized properties of canard solutions, which spend unexpectedly long times near dynamically unstable manifolds in the phase space of an underlying dynamical system. We have recently introduced techniques to identify and analyze rivers, which are a class of trajectories that can serve as transient attractors in phase space. In this work, after generalizing the concept of rivers to arbitrary dimensions and introducing a classification of rivers, we show that maximal canards in systems with one fast and two slow variables are rivers of infinite order, or river canards. We use this relationship to provide new insights about how nearby trajectories behave and about how river canards organize the flow near the fold of a critical manifold. This analysis includes the calculation of the way-in way-out function, which provides an estimate for the extent of the delay in escape that trajectories experience when passing near the fold of a critical manifold with canard dynamics, without the need for complexification of time. We also illustrate our results for the well-known autocatalator system.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study a system of ordinary differential equations in [math] that is used as a model both in population dynamics and in game theory and is known to exhibit a heteroclinic network consisting in the union of four types of elementary heteroclinic cycles. We show the asymptotic stability of the network for parameter values in a range compatible with both population and game dynamics. We obtain estimates of the relative attractiveness of each one of the cycles by computing their stability indices. For the parameter values ensuring the asymptotic stability of the network we relate the attractiveness properties of each cycle to the others. In particular, for three of the cycles we show that if one of them has a weak form of attractiveness, then the other two are completely unstable. We also show the existence of an open region in parameter space where all four cycles are completely unstable and the network is asymptotically stable, giving rise to intricate dynamics that has been observed numerically by other authors.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Particles suspended in fluid flow through a curved duct focus to stable equilibrium positions in the duct cross-section due to the balance of two dominant forces: (i) inertial lift force, arising from the inertia of the fluid, and (ii) secondary drag force, resulting from cross-sectional vortices induced by the curvature of the duct. Such particle focusing is exploited in various medical and industrial technologies aimed at separating particles by size. Using the theoretical model developed by Harding, Stokes, and Bertozzi [J. Fluid Mech., 875 (2019), pp. 1–43], we numerically investigate the dynamics of neutrally buoyant particles in fluid flow through curved ducts with rectangular cross-sections at low flow rates. We explore the rich bifurcations that take place in the particle equilibria as a function of three system parameters—particle size, duct bend radius, and aspect ratio of the cross-section. We also explore the transient dynamics of particles as they focus to their equilibria by delineating the effects of these three parameters, as well as the initial location of the particle inside the cross-section, on the focusing dynamics.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We develop a simple financial market model in which a market maker adjusts the price with respect to orders placed by chartists and fundamentalists. A novel feature of our model is that fundamentalists optimistically (pessimistically) believe in a relatively high (low) fundamental value when the financial market is increasing (decreasing). As it turns out, the dynamics of our model is driven by a two-dimensional discontinuous piecewise linear map for which we provide an in-depth analytical and numerical investigation. Among other things, we obtain in explicit form the boundaries of the periodicity regions associated with attracting cycles with rotation number [math], [math] These boundaries correspond to border collision bifurcations of the related cycles. We show that the periodicity regions are organized in a specific period adding structure, and some of the regions may overlap. Several examples of coexisting cycles and their basins of attraction are also presented. Economically, our results offer a new explanation for the boom-bust behavior of actual financial markets.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the problem of parameter estimation for large exchangeable interacting particle systems when a sample of discrete observations from a single particle is known. We propose a novel method based on martingale estimating functions constructed by employing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the generator of the mean field limit, where the law of the process is replaced by the (unique) invariant measure of the mean field dynamics. We then prove that our estimator is asymptotically unbiased and asymptotically normal when the number of observations and the number of particles tend to infinity, and we provide a rate of convergence toward the exact value of the parameters. Finally, we present several numerical experiments which show the accuracy of our estimator and corroborate our theoretical findings, even in the case that the mean field dynamics exhibit more than one steady state.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of circumstances under which wave dynamics can be fully reconstructed from sensor networks. We prove that, in many cases, wave dynamics can be fully reconstructed from a single sensor, but that such reconstructions can be sensitive to small perturbations in sensor placement. In general, multiple sensors are necessary, and we outline a procedure for reconstructing the dynamics from them. We also show that if a network of [math] sensors suffers from Gaussian noise, then the reconstruction error decreases as [math]. We illustrate and verify these results numerically by simulating wave dynamics and then reconstructing from sensor data the initial state of the system and time series of the system at randomly chosen locations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Networks are a widely used tool for investigating the large-scale connectivity structure in complex systems and graphons have been proposed as an infinite-size limit of dense networks. The detection of communities or other meso-scale structures is a prominent topic in network science as it allows the identification of functional building blocks in complex systems. Similarly, we may want to simplify graphons in terms of communities, in order to gain a comprehensible description of their meso-scale structure. This raises the question of how communities in graphons can be identified. In this paper, we define a graphon modularity and demonstrate that it can be maximized to detect communities in graphons. We then investigate specific synthetic graphons and show that they may show a wide range of different community structures. We also reformulate the graphon-modularity maximization as a continuous optimization problem and so prove the optimal community structure or lack thereof for some graphons, something that is usually not possible for networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that estimating a graphon from network data as an intermediate step can improve the detection of communities, in comparison with exclusively maximizing the modularity of the network. While the choice of graphon estimator may strongly influence the accord between the community structure of a network and its estimated graphon, we find that there is a substantial overlap if an appropriate estimator is used. Our study demonstrates that community detection for graphons is possible and may serve as a privacy-preserving way to cluster network data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ability to manipulate cellular function using an external stimulus is a powerful strategy for studying complex biological phenomena. One approach to modulate the function of the cellular environment is split proteins. In this method, a biologically active protein or an enzyme is fragmented so that it reassembles only upon a specific stimulus. While there are many tools available to induce these systems, nature has provided other mechanisms that can be utilized to expand the split protein toolbox. Here we show a novel method for reconstituting split proteins using magnetic stimulation. We have found that the Electromagnetic Perceptive Gene (EPG) changes conformation due to magnetic fields stimulation. By fusing split fragments of a certain protein to both termini of the EPG, the fragments can be reassembled into a functional protein under magnetic stimulation due to conformational change. We show this effect with three separate split proteins; NanoLuc, APEX2, and Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 Thymidine Kinase. Our results show for the first time, that reconstitution of split proteins can be achieved only with magnetic fields. We anticipate that this study will be a starting point for future magnetically inducible split protein designs for cellular perturbation and manipulation. With this technology, we can help to expand the toolbox of the split protein platform and allow better elucidation of complex biological systems.]]></summary>

Cancer progression can be described by continuous-time Markov chains whose state space grows exponentially in the number of somatic mutations. The age of a tumor at diagnosis is typically unknown. Therefore, the quantity of interest is the time-marginal distribution over all possible genotypes of tumors, defined as the transient distribution integrated over an exponentially distributed observation time. It can be obtained as the solution of a large linear system. However, the sheer size of this system renders classical solvers infeasible. We consider Markov chains whose transition rates are separable functions, allowing for an efficient low-rank tensor representation of the linear system’s operator. Thus we can reduce the computational complexity from exponential to linear. We derive a convergent iterative method using low-rank formats whose result satisfies the normalization constraint of a distribution. We also perform numerical experiments illustrating that the marginal distribution is well approximated with low rank.]]></summary>

Nonlinear dynamics of discontinuous oscillators with unilateral constraints and non-random parametric uncertainties are investigated. Nonlinear oscillators considering single- and double-sided constraints are carefully constructed to exhibit rich bifurcations, such as period-doubling and Neimark–Sacker bifurcations. In deterministic amplitude–frequency responses, both hardening and softening effects are induced by non-smooth contact-type nonlinearities. Stabilities of the solutions are determined by the shooting method and the monodromy matrix. To effectively quantify the behaviors of nonlinear oscillators in the presence of parametric uncertainties, a non-intrusive surrogate function aided by arc-length ratio interpolation is constructed. Simulation results demonstrate variabilities of nonlinear responses under different non-random uncertainties. Moreover, an accuracy verification is provided to verify the effectiveness of the non-intrusive uncertainty propagation method. It is found that the surrogate function in combination with the arc-length ratio technique has high accuracy and evolutions of turning points are captured satisfactorily regardless of complex interactions of nonlinearities and uncertainties. The findings and methodologies reported are meaningful to general nonlinear systems having complex motions, paving the road for more in-depth investigations into uncertain nonlinear dynamics.]]></summary>

Dynamic models of the water-lubricated bearing-rotor system under fluid lubrication are developed. The influences of different operating modules on the dynamic characteristics are investigated. The effects of different speeds, different loads, and different impacts are analyzed. The time domain responses, axis orbits, and phase diagram are gained. Velocity has impacts on the vibration performance of the shaft. The external load has slight effects on the vibration characteristics. Different forms of transient impacts have different effects on the vibration characteristics. The validity of the new-built models is verified by experiments. Results provide theoretical foundations for the optimum design for such bearing-rotor systems.]]></summary>

Gen. 55, 384010 (2022)], we explore the anomalous dispersive relations, inverse scattering transform, and fractional [math]-soliton solutions of the integrable fractional higher-order nonlinear Schrödinger (fHONLS) equations, containing the fractional third-order NLS (fTONLS), fractional complex mKdV (fcmKdV), and fractional fourth-order nonlinear Schrödinger (fFONLS) equations, etc. The inverse scattering problem can be solved exactly by means of the matrix Riemann–Hilbert problem with simple poles. As a consequence, an explicit formula is found for the fractional [math]-soliton solutions of the fHONLS equations in the reflectionless case. In particular, we analyze the fractional one-, two-, and three-soliton solutions with anomalous dispersions of fTONLS and fcmKdV equations. The wave, group, and phase velocities of these envelope fractional one-soliton solutions are related to the power laws of their amplitudes. Moreover, we also deduce the formula for the fractional [math]-soliton solutions of all fHONLS equations and analyze some velocities of the one-soliton solution. These obtained fractional [math]-soliton solutions may be useful to explain the related super-dispersion transports of nonlinear waves in fractional nonlinear media.]]></summary>

The phenomenon of slow passage through a Hopf bifurcation is ubiquitous in multiple-timescale dynamical systems, where a slowly varying quantity replacing a static parameter induces the solutions of the resulting slow–fast system to feel the effect of the Hopf bifurcation with a delay. This phenomenon is well understood in the context of smooth slow–fast dynamical systems; in the present work, we study it for the first time in piecewise linear (PWL) slow–fast systems. This special class of systems is indeed known to reproduce all features of their smooth counterpart while being more amenable to quantitative analysis and offering some level of simplification, in particular, through the existence of canonical (linear) slow manifolds. We provide conditions for a PWL slow–fast system to exhibit a slow passage through a Hopf-like bifurcation, in link with possible connections between canonical attracting and repelling slow manifolds. In doing so, we fully describe the so-called way-in/way-out function. Finally, we investigate this slow passage effect in the Doi–Kumagai model, a neuronal PWL model exhibiting elliptic bursting oscillations.]]></summary>

We study the time-dependent behavior of dissipative solitons (DSs) stabilized by nonlinear gradient terms. Two cases are investigated: first, the case of the presence of a Raman term, and second, the simultaneous presence of two nonlinear gradient terms, the Raman term and the dispersion of nonlinear gain. As possible types of time-dependence, we find a number of different possibilities including periodic behavior, quasi-periodic behavior, and also chaos. These different types of time-dependence are found to form quite frequently from a window structure of alternating behavior, for example, of periodic and quasi-periodic behaviors. To analyze the time dependence, we exploit extensively time series and Fourier transforms. We discuss in detail quantitatively the question whether all the DSs found for the cubic complex Ginzburg–Landau equation with nonlinear gradient terms are generic, meaning whether they are stable against structural perturbations, for example, to the additions of a small quintic perturbation as it arises naturally in an envelope equation framework. Finally, we examine to what extent it is possible to have different types of DSs for fixed parameter values in the equation by just varying the initial conditions, for example, by using narrow and high vs broad and low amplitudes. These results indicate an overlapping multi-basin structure in parameter space.]]></summary>

We perform a handwritten-digit recognition task by greatly increasing the number of virtual nodes in delayed feedback using outputs from multiple delay times. Final simulation results confirm that the recognition accuracy can reach 99% after systematically optimizing the reservoir hyperparameters.

We study the relationship between the structures of the nonlinear localized waves and the distribution characteristics of the modulation stability regime in a nonlinear fiber with both third-order and fourth-order effects. On the background frequency and background amplitude plane, the modulation stability region consists of two symmetric curves on the left and right and a point on the symmetry axis. We find that the higher-order excitation characteristics are obviously different at different positions in the modulation stability region. Their excitation characteristics are closely related to the modulation instability distribution characteristics of the system. It is shown that asymmetric high-order rational solitons are excited at the left and right stable curves, and the symmetric one is excited at the stable points. Interestingly, the asymmetric higher-order rational solitons on the left and right sides are mirror-symmetrical to each other, which coincides with the symmetry of the modulation instability distribution. These results can deepen our understanding of the relationship between nonlinear excitation and modulation instability and enrich our knowledge about higher-order nonlinear excitations.]]></summary>

A platform-vibrator with shock is a low-frequency machine used in the construction industry for compaction and molding of large concrete products. Its mathematical model is a two-degree-of-freedom two-body vibro-impact system with a soft impact. Some changes in its parameters can increase the machine performance and improve the product quality, but these same changes may lead to the emergence of critical states, such as coexisting regimes in hysteresis zone, chaotic motion, intermittency and crisis-induced intermittency, crises, and transient chaos. Some of them can be undesirable and dangerous. This article shows their diagnostics and recognition, the possibility of their prediction, as well as the criterion determining the set of parameter ranges where critical states can occur.

Quantitatively assessing the level of confidence on a test score can be a challenging problem, especially when the available information is based on multiple criteria. A concrete example beyond the usual grading of tests occurs with recommendation letters, where a recommender assigns a score to a candidate, but the reliability of the recommender must be assessed as well. Here, we present a statistical procedure, based on Bayesian inference and Jaynes’ maximum entropy principle, that can be used to estimate the most probable and expected score given the available information in the form of a credible interval. Our results may provide insights on how to properly state and analyze problems related to the uncertain evaluation of performance in learning applied to several contexts, beyond the case study of the recommendation letters presented here.]]></summary>

Key features of biological activity can often be captured by transitions between a finite number of semi-stable states that correspond to behaviors or decisions. We present here a broad class of dynamical systems that are ideal for modeling such activity. The models we propose are chaotic heteroclinic networks with nontrivial intersections of stable and unstable manifolds. Due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, transitions between states are seemingly random. Dwell times, exit distributions, and other transition statistics can be built into the model through geometric design and can be controlled by tunable parameters. To test our model’s ability to simulate realistic biological phenomena, we turned to one of the most studied organisms, C. elegans, well known for its limited behavioral states. We reconstructed experimental data from two laboratories, demonstrating the model’s ability to quantitatively reproduce dwell times and transition statistics under a variety of conditions. Stochastic switching between dominant states in complex dynamical systems has been extensively studied and is often modeled as Markov chains. As an alternative, we propose here a new paradigm, namely, chaotic heteroclinic networks generated by deterministic rules (without the necessity for noise). Chaotic heteroclinic networks can be used to model systems with arbitrary architecture and size without a commensurate increase in phase dimension. They are highly flexible and able to capture a wide range of transition characteristics that can be adjusted through control parameters.]]></summary>

Biological neurons can exhibit complex coexisting multiple firing patterns dependent on initial conditions. To this end, this paper presents a novel adaptive synapse-based neuron (ASN) model with sine activation function. The ASN model has time-varying equilibria with the variation of externally applied current and its equilibrium stability involves transitions between stable and unstable points through fold and Hopf bifurcations, resulting in complex distributions of attractive regions with heterogeneous multi-stability. Globally coexisting heterogeneous behaviors are studied by bifurcation diagram, phase portrait, dynamical distribution, and basin of attraction. The results show that the number of coexisting heterogeneous attractors can be up to 12, but for a simple neuron model, such a large number of coexisting heterogeneous attractors has not been reported in the relevant literature. Most interestingly, the ASN model also has riddled-like complex basins of attraction and four illustrative examples are depicted by the phase portraits with small changes of the initial conditions. Besides, the ASN model is implemented using a simple microcontroller platform, and various heterogeneous coexisting attractors are acquired experimentally to validate the numerical results.]]></summary>

To facilitate new approaches for research, biomedicine, and biotechnological applications, we developed a set of arabinose-inducible artificial transcription factors (ATFs) using CRISPR/dCas9 and Arabidopsis-derived DNA-binding proteins, allowing to control gene expression in E. coli and Salmonella over a wide inducer concentration range. As a proof-of-concept, we employed the developed ATFs to engineer a Salmonella biosensor strain, SALSOR 0.2 (SALmonella biosenSOR 0.2), which responds to the presence of alkaloid drugs with quantifiable fluorescent output. We demonstrated that SALSOR 0.2 was able to detect the presence of the antitussive noscapine alkaloid with ~2.3-fold increased fluorescent signal over background noise compared to a previously described biosensor. Moreover, we used plant-derived ATFs to control {beta}-carotene biosynthesis in E. coli, which resulted in ~1.6-fold higher {beta}-carotene production compared to expression of the biosynthesis pathway using a strong constitutive promoter. The arabinose-inducible ATFs reported here thus enhance the synthetic biology repertoire of transcriptional regulatory modules that allow tuning protein expression in the Gram-negative model organisms Salmonella and E. coli.]]></summary>

The military and police force require ballistic armour to ensure the safety of their personnel, while the aerospace industry requires materials that enable the capture, preservation and study of hypervelocity projectiles. However, current industry standards display at least one inherent limitation. To resolve these limitations we have turned to nature, utilising proteins that have evolved over millennia to enable effective energy dissipation. Specifically, a recombinant form of the mechanosensitive protein talin was incorporated into a monomeric unit and crosslinked, resulting in the production of the first reported example of a talin shock absorbing material (TSAM). When subjected to 1.5 km/s supersonic shots, TSAMs were shown not only to absorb the impact, but to capture/preserve the projectile, making TSAMs the first reported protein material to achieve this.]]></summary>

Reduced-order modelling and low-dimensional surrogate models generated using machine learning algorithms have been widely applied in high-dimensional dynamical systems to improve the algorithmic efficiency. In this paper, we develop a system which combines reduced-order surrogate models with a novel data assimilation (DA) technique used to incorporate real-time observations from different physical spaces. We make use of local smooth surrogate functions which link the space of encoded system variables and the one of current observations to perform variational DA with a low computational cost. The new system, named generalised latent assimilation can benefit both the efficiency provided by the reduced-order modelling and the accuracy of data assimilation. A theoretical analysis of the difference between surrogate and original assimilation cost function is also provided in this paper where an upper bound, depending on the size of the local training set, is given. The new approach is tested on a high-dimensional (CFD) application of a two-phase liquid flow with non-linear observation operators that current Latent Assimilation methods can not handle. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed assimilation approach can significantly improve the reconstruction and prediction accuracy of the deep learning surrogate model which is nearly 1000 times faster than the CFD simulation.]]></summary>

It is well known that Keller–Segel models serve as a paradigm to describe the self aggregation phenomenon, which exists in a variety of biological processes such as wound healing, tumor growth, etc. In this paper, we study the existence of monotone decreasing spiky steady state and its linear stability property in the Keller–Segel model with logistic growth over one-dimensional bounded domain subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Under the assumption that chemo-attractive coefficient is asymptotically large, we construct the single boundary spike and next show this non-constant steady state is locally linear stable via Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction method. As a consequence, the multi-symmetric spikes are obtained by reflection and periodic extension. In particular, we present the formal analysis to illustrate our rigorous theoretical results.]]></summary>

In this paper, we present and introduce two efficient Hamiltonian conservative fully discrete numerical schemes for Korteweg-de Vries equations. The new numerical schemes are constructed by using time-stepping spectral Petrov-Galerkin (SPG) or Gauss collocation (SGC) methods for the temporal discretization coupled with the p-version/spectral local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods for the space discretization. We prove that the fully discrete SPG-LDG scheme preserves both the momentum and the Hamilton energy exactly for generalized KdV equations. While the fully discrete SGC-LDG formulation preserves the momentum and the Hamilton energy exactly for linearized KdV equations. As for nonlinear KdV equations, the SGC-LDG scheme preserves the momentum exactly and is Hamiltonian conserving up to some spectral accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the fully-discrete SGC-LDG and SPG-LDG methods converge exponentially with respect to the polynomial degree in both space and time for linear KdV equations. The numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate that the proposed numerical methods preserve the momentum,

This article studies the asymptotic profiles of coexistence endemic equilibrium solutions of a two-strain reaction-diffusion epidemic model with mass-action incidence when the diffusion rates are sufficiently small. We address the question of how the population size and environmental heterogeneity impact the persistence and extinction of the disease when the diffusion rates approach zero. In particular, we show that there is a sharp critical number which depends delicately on the infected groups’ diffusion rates and each strain’s spatially heterogeneous infection and recovery rates. Moreover, if the total size of the population is kept below this critical number, then the disease could be eradicated by restricting the susceptible hosts’ movement . However, if the total population exceeds this critical number, the disease may persist no matter how the movement of the susceptible hosts is controlled. Additionally, our results suggest that the disease may persist if the diffusion rates of the infected groups are kept sufficiently smaller than that of the susceptible group.]]></summary>

Here, we develop a unified theoretical framework to explore how polymorphism at targeted loci can be generated and maintained by either disassortative mating choice or balancing selection due to, for example, heterozygote advantage. To this aim, we model the dynamics of alleles at a single locus A in a population of haploid individuals, where reproductive success depends on the combination of alleles carried by the parents at locus A. Our theoretical study of the model confirms that the conditions for the persistence of a given level of allelic polymorphism depend on the relative reproductive advantages among pairs of individuals. Interestingly, equilibria with unbalanced allelic frequencies were shown to emerge from successive introduction of mutants. We then investigate the role of the function linking allelic divergence to reproductive advantage on the evolutionary fate of alleles within the population. Our results highlight the significance of the shape of this function for both the number of alleles maintained and their level of genetic divergence. Large number of alleles are maintained with substantial replacement of alleles, when disassortative advantage slowly increases with allelic differentiation . In contrast, few highly differentiated alleles are predicted to be maintained when genetic differentiation has a strong effect on disassortative advantage. These opposite effects predicted by our model explain how disassortative mate choice may lead to various levels of allelic differentiation and polymorphism, and shed light on the effect of mate preferences on the persistence of balanced and unbalanced polymorphism in natural population.]]></summary>

Cancer is usually considered a genetic disease caused by alterations in genes that control cellular behaviors, especially growth and division. Cancer cells differ from normal tissue cells in many ways that allow them to grow out of control and become invasive. However, experiments have shown that aberrant growth in many tissues burdened with varying numbers of mutant cells can be corrected, and wild-type cells are required for the active elimination of mutant cells. These findings reveal the dynamic cellular behaviors that lead to a tissue homeostatic state when faced with mutational and nonmutational insults. The current study was motivated by these observations and established a mathematical model of how a tissue copes with the aberrant behavior of mutant cells. The proposed model depicts the interaction between wild-type and mutant cells through a system of two delay differential equations, which include the random mutation of normal cells and the active extrusion of mutant cells. Based on the proposed model, we performed qualitative analysis to identify the conditions of either normal tissue homeostasis or uncontrolled growth with varying numbers of abnormal mutant cells. Bifurcation analysis suggests the conditions of bistability with either a small or large number of mutant cells, the coexistence of bistable steady states can be clinically beneficial by driving the state of mutant cell predominance to the attraction basin of the state with a low number of mutant cells. This result is further confirmed by the treatment strategy obtained from optimal control theory.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve fibers has always been an attractive field of research. Due to the higher activation threshold, the stimulation of small fibers is accompanied by the stimulation of larger ones. It is therefore necessary to design a specific stimulation theme in order to only activate narrow fibers. There is evidence that stimulating Aδ fibers can activate endogenous pain-relieving mechanisms. However, both selective stimulation and reducing pain by activating small nociceptive fibers are still poorly investigated. In this study, using high-frequency stimulation waveforms (5–20 kHz), computational modeling provides a simple framework for activating narrow nociceptive fibers. Additionally, a model of myelinated nerve fibers is modified by including sodium–potassium pump and investigating its effects on neuronal stimulation. Besides, a modified mathematical model of pain processing circuits in the dorsal horn is presented that consists of supraspinal pain control mechanisms. Hence, by employing this pain-modulating model, the mechanism of the reduction of pain by activating nociceptive fibers is explored. In the case of two fibers with the same distance from the point source electrode, a single stimulation waveform is capable of blocking one large fiber and stimulating another small fiber. Noteworthy, the Na/K pump model demonstrated that it does not have a significant effect on the activation threshold and firing frequency of fiber. Ultimately, results suggest that the descending pathways of Locus coeruleus may effectively contribute to pain relief through stimulation of nociceptive fibers, which will be beneficial for clinical interventions.]]></summary>

We propose and analyze numerical schemes for the gradient flow of Q-tensor with the quasi-entropy. The quasi-entropy is a strictly convex, rotationally invariant elementary function, giving a singular potential constraining the eigenvalues of Q within the physical range 
                      
                      \((-1/3,2/3)\)
                      
                    . Compared with the potential derived from the Bingham distribution, the quasi-entropy has the same asymptotic behavior and underlying physics. Meanwhile, it is very easy to evaluate because of its simple expression. For the elastic energy, we include all the rotationally invariant terms. The numerical schemes for the gradient flow are built on the nice properties of the quasi-entropy. The first-order time discretization is uniquely solvable, keeping the physical constraints and energy dissipation, which are all independent of the time step. The second-order time discretization keeps the first two properties unconditionally, and the third with an O(1) restriction on the time step. These results also hold when we further incorporate a second-order discretization in space. Error estimates are also established for time discretization and full discretization. Numerical examples about defect patterns are presented to validate the theoretical results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
The shape of cells and the control thereof plays a central role in a variety of cellular processes, including endo- and exocytosis, cell division and cell movement. Intra- and extracellular forces control the shapes, and while the shape changes in some processes such as exocytosis are intracellularly-controlled and localized in the cell, movement requires force transmission to the environment, and the feedback from it can affect the cell shape and mode of movement used. The shape of a cell is determined by its cytoskeleton (CSK), and thus shape changes involved in various processes involve controlled remodeling of the CSK. While much is known about individual components involved in these processes, an integrated understanding of how intra- and extracellular signals are coupled to the control of the mechanical changes involved is not at hand for any of them. As a first step toward understanding the interaction between intracellular forces imposed on the membrane and cell shape, we investigate the role of distributed surrogates for cortical forces in producing the observed three-dimensional shapes. We show how different balances of applied forces lead to such shapes, that there are different routes to the same end state, and that state transitions between axisymmetric shapes need not all be axisymmetric. Examples of the force distributions that lead to protrusions are given, and the shape changes induced by adhesion of a cell to a surface are studied. The results provide a reference framework for developing detailed models of intracellular force distributions observed experimentally, and provide a basis for studying how movement of a cell in a tissue or fluid is influenced by its shape.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We investigate the local equilibrium (LE) distribution of a crystal surface jump process as it approaches its hydrodynamic (continuum) limit in a nonstandard scaling regime introduced by Marzuola and Weare. The atypical scaling leads to a local equilibrium state whose structure is novel to the best of our knowledge. The distinguishing characteristic of the new, rough LE state is that the ensemble average of single lattice site observables do not vary smoothly across lattice sites. We investigate numerically and analytically how the rough LE state affects the convergence mechanism via three key limits, and we show that by comparison more standard, “smooth” LE states satisfy stronger versions of these limits.]]></summary>

Various environmental alterations resulting from the current global change compromise the persistence of species in their habitual environment. To cope with the obvious risk of extinction, plastic responses provide organisms with rapid acclimatization to new environments. The premise of plastic rescue has been theoretically studied from mathematical models in both deterministic and stochastic environments, focusing on analyzing the persistence and stability of the populations. Here, we evaluate this premise in the framework of a consumer-resource interaction considering the energy investment towards reproduction vs. maintenance as a plastic trait according to positive/negative variation of the available resource. A basic consumer-resource mathematical model is formulated based on the principle of biomass conversion that incorporates the energy allocation toward vital functions of the life-cycle of consumer individuals. Our mathematical approach is based on the impulsive differential equations at fixed moments considering two impulsive effects associated with the instants at which consumers obtain environmental information and when energy allocation strategy change occurs. From a preliminary analysis of the non-plastic temporal dynamics, namely when the energy allocation is constant over time and without experiencing changes concerning the variation of resources, both the persistence and stability of the consumer-resource dynamic are dependent on the energy allocation strategies belonging to a set termed stability range. We found that the plastic energy allocation can promote a stable dynamical pattern in the consumer-resource interaction depending on both the magnitude of the energy allocation change and the time lag between environmental sensibility instants and when the expression of the plastic trait occurs.]]></summary>

Non-linear partial differential Kolmogorov equations are successfully used to describe a wide range of time dependent phenomena, in natural sciences, engineering or even finance. For example, in physical systems, the Allen–Cahn equation describes pattern formation associated to phase transitions. In finance, instead, the Black–Scholes equation describes the evolution of the price of derivative investment instruments. Such modern applications often require to solve these equations in high-dimensional regimes in which classical approaches are ineffective. Recently, an interesting new approach based on deep learning has been introduced byby E, Han and Jentzen [1, 2]. The main idea is to construct a deep network which is trained from the samples of discrete stochastic differential equations underlying Kolmogorov’s equation. The network is able to approximate, numerically at least, the solutions of the Kolmogorov equation with polynomial complexity in whole spatial domains. In this contribution we study variants of the deep networks by using different discretizations schemes of the stochastic differential equation. We compare the performance of the associated networks, on benchmarked examples, and show that, for some discretization schemes, improvements in the accuracy are possible without affecting the observed computational complexity.]]></summary>

In this manuscript a POD-Galerkin based Reduced Order Model for unsteady Fluid-Structure Interaction problems is presented. The model is based on a partitioned algorithm, with semi-implicit treatment of the coupling conditions. A Chorin–Temam projection scheme is applied to the incompressible Navier–Stokes problem, and a Robin coupling condition is used for the coupling between the fluid and the solid. The coupled problem is based on an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation, and the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition procedure is used for the generation of the reduced basis. We extend existing works on a segregated Reduced Order Model for Fluid-Structure Interaction to unsteady problems that couple an incompressible, Newtonian fluid with a linear elastic solid, in two spatial dimensions. We consider three test cases to assess the overall capabilities of the method: an unsteady, non-parametrized problem, a problem that presents a geometrical parametrization of the solid domain, and finally, a problem where a parametrization of the solid’s shear modulus is taken into account.]]></summary>

A method for the multifidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC) estimation of statistical quantities is proposed which is applicable to computational budgets of any size. Based on a sequence of optimization problems each with a globally minimizing closed-form solution, this method extends the usability of a well known MFMC algorithm, recovering it when the computational budget is large enough. Theoretical results verify that the proposed approach is at least as optimal as its namesake and retains the benefits of multifidelity estimation with minimal assumptions on the budget or amount of available data, providing a notable reduction in variance over simple Monte Carlo estimation.]]></summary>

This is the third paper in a series in which we develop machine learning (ML) moment closure models for the radiative transfer equation. In our previous work (Huang et al. in J Comput Phys 453:110941, 2022), we proposed an approach to learn the gradient of the unclosed high order moment, which performs much better than learning the moment itself and the conventional 
                      
                      \(P_N\)
                      
                     closure. However, while the ML moment closure has better accuracy, it is not able to guarantee hyperbolicity and has issues with long time stability. In our second paper (Huang et al., in: Machine learning moment closure models for the radiative transfer equation II: enforcing global hyperbolicity in gradient based closures, 2021. arXiv:2105.14410), we identified a symmetrizer which leads to conditions that enforce that the gradient based ML closure is symmetrizable hyperbolic and stable over long time. The limitation of this approach is that in practice the highest moment can only be related to four, or fewer, lower moments. In this paper, we propose a new method to enforce the hyperbolicity of the ML closure model. Motivated by the observation that the coefficient matrix of the closure system is a lower Hessenberg matrix, we relate its eigenvalues to the roots of an associated polynomial. We design two new neural network architectures based on this relation. The ML closure model resulting from the first neural network is weakly hyperbolic and guarantees the physical characteristic speeds, i.e., the eigenvalues are bounded by the speed of light. The second model is strictly hyperbolic and does not guarantee the boundedness of the eigenvalues. Several benchmark tests including the Gaussian source problem and the two-material problem show the good accuracy, stability and generalizability of our hyperbolic ML closure model.]]></summary>

The orthogonal decomposition factorizes a tensor into a sum of an orthogonal list of rank-one tensors. The corresponding rank is called orthogonal rank. We present several properties of orthogonal rank, which are different from those of tensor rank in many aspects. For instance, a subtensor may have a larger orthogonal rank than the whole tensor. To fit the orthogonal decomposition, we propose an algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian method. The gradient of the objective function has a nice structure, inspiring us to use gradient-based optimization methods to solve it. We guarantee the orthogonality by a novel orthogonalization process. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method has a great advantage over the existing methods for strongly orthogonal decompositions in terms of the approximation error.]]></summary>

In this paper, we extend the class of kernel methods, the so-called diffusion maps (DM) and ghost point diffusion maps (GPDM), to solve the time-dependent advection-diffusion PDE on unknown smooth manifolds without and with boundaries. The core idea is to directly approximate the spatial components of the differential operator on the manifold with a local integral operator and combine it with the standard implicit time difference scheme. When the manifold has a boundary, a simplified version of the GPDM approach is used to overcome the bias of the integral approximation near the boundary. The Monte-Carlo discretization of the integral operator over the point cloud data gives rise to a mesh-free formulation that is natural for randomly distributed points, even when the manifold is embedded in high-dimensional ambient space. Here, we establish the convergence of the proposed solver on appropriate topologies, depending on the distribution of point cloud data and boundary type. We provide numerical results to validate the convergence results on various examples that involve simple geometry and an unknown manifold.]]></summary>

A cross-product free (CPF) Jacobi–Davidson type method is proposed to compute a partial generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) of a large regular matrix pair 
                      
                      \(\{A,B\}\)
                      
                    , called CPF-JDGSVD. It implicitly solves the mathematically equivalent generalized eigenvalue problem of the cross-product matrix pair 
                      
                      \(\{A^TA,B^TB\}\)
                      
                     using the Rayleigh–Ritz projection method but does not form the cross-product matrices explicitly, and thus avoids the possible accuracy loss of the computed generalized singular values and generalized singular vectors. The method is an inner-outer iteration method, where the expansion of the right searching subspace forms the inner iterations that approximately solve the correction equations involved and the outer iterations extract approximate GSVD components with respect to the subspaces. A convergence result is established for the outer iterations, compact bounds are derived for the condition numbers of the correction equations, and the least solution accuracy requirements on the inner iterations are found, which can maximize the overall efficiency of CPF-JDGSVD as much as possible. Based on them, practical stopping criteria are designed for the inner iterations. A thick-restart CPF-JDGSVD algorithm with deflation and purgation is developed to compute several GSVD components of

 Abstract. We consider the problem of determining the arrival statistics of unbiased planar random walkers to complex target configurations. In contrast to problems posed in finite domains, simple moments of the first passage time distribution, such as its mean and variance, are not defined. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain the full arrival statistics. We describe several methods to obtain these distributions and other associated quantities such as splitting probabilities. One approach combines a Laplace transform of the underlying parabolic equation with matched asymptotic analysis followed by numerical transform inversion. The second approach is similar but uses a boundary integral equation method to solve for the transformed variable. To validate the results of this theory, and to obtain the arrival time statistics in very general configurations of absorbers, we introduce an efficient kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method that describes trajectories as a combination of large but exactly solvable projection steps. The effectiveness of these methodologies is demonstrated on a variety of challenging examples highlighting the applicability of these methods to a variety of practical scenarios, such as source inference. A particularly useful finding arising from these results is that homogenization theories, in which complex configurations are replaced by equivalent simple ones, are remarkably effective at describing arrival time statistics.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Wolbachia is a natural bacterium that can infect mosquitoes and reduce their ability to transmit mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, Zika, and chikungunya. Field trials and modeling studies have shown that the fraction of infection among the mosquitoes must exceed a threshold level for the infection to persist. To capture this threshold, it is critical to consider the spatial heterogeneity in the distributions of the infected and uninfected mosquitoes created by a local release of the infected mosquitoes. We develop and analyze PDE models to study the invasion dynamics of Wolbachia infection among mosquitoes in the field. Our reaction-diffusion-type models account for the complex vertical transmission and the spatial mosquito dispersion. We characterize the threshold for a successful invasion with a bubble-shaped distribution, called the “critical bubble.” The critical bubble is optimal in its release size compared to other spatial profiles in a one-dimensional landscape. The fraction of infection near the release center is higher than the threshold level for the corresponding homogeneously mixing ODE models. We show that the proposed spatial models give rise to the traveling waves of Wolbachia infection when above the threshold. We quantify how the threshold condition and traveling-wave velocity depend on the diffusion coefficients and other model parameters. Numerical studies for different scenarios are presented to inform the design of release strategies.]]></summary>

The global stability of equilibria is obtained by means of the generalized Lyapunov method. In addition, combining the Poincaré maps, the displacement function, and a Melnikov-like method, we derive some sufficient conditions to ensure the existence, uniqueness, and global stability of a slowly oscillating periodic solution. Numerical simulations are performed to explore the effectiveness of the quarantine control measure and the effects of the delay.]]></summary>

Homeostasis represents the idea that a feature may remain invariant despite changes in some external parameters. We establish a connection between homeostasis and injectivity for reaction network models. In particular, we show that a reaction network cannot exhibit homeostasis if a modified version of the network (which we call homeostasis-associated network) is injective. We provide examples of reaction networks which can or cannot exhibit homeostasis by analyzing the injectivity of their homeostasis-associated networks.]]></summary>

Consider a large ecosystem (foodweb) with n species, where the abundances follow a Lotka–Volterra system of coupled differential equations. We assume that each species interacts with

This parameter d reflects the connectance of the foodweb and the sparsity of its interactions especially if d is much smaller that n. We address the question of feasibility of the foodweb, that is the existence of an equilibrium solution of the Lotka-Volterra system with no vanishing species. We establish that for a given range of d, namely

The optimization problem is solved effectively by augmented Lagrangian method (

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
In this work, the error splitting technique combined with cut-off function method is designed to derive unconditionally optimal error estimates for a fully implicit conservative numerical method of the N-coupled nonlinear Schrödinger–Boussinesq equations, which is constructed by an implicit Crank–Nicolson-type method in time and new nonconforming virtual element methods in space. The numerical scheme is conservative in the senses of discrete mass and energy, and the cut-off error splitting technique is innovative to remove the standard time-step conditions 
                      
                      \(\tau =o(h^{d/4})\)

                    . Finally, several numerical examples are given to confirm our theoretical results. The analytical technique in this work could be used to study other implicit numerical methods of nonlinear physical models, including but not limited to conforming and nonconforming finite element methods/virtual element methods.]]></summary>

Doxorubicin is a chemotherapy widely used to treat several types of cancer, including triple-negative breast cancer. In this work, we use a Bayesian framework to rigorously assess the ability of ten different mathematical models to describe the dynamics of four TNBC cell lines (SUM-149PT, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, and MDA-MB-468) in response to treatment with doxorubicin at concentrations ranging from 10 to 2500 nM. Each cell line was plated and serially imaged via fluorescence microscopy for 30 days following 6, 12, or 24 h of in vitro drug exposure. We use the resulting data sets to estimate the parameters of the ten pharmacodynamic models using a Bayesian approach, which accounts for uncertainties in the models, parameters, and observational data. The ten candidate models describe the growth patterns and degree of response to doxorubicin for each cell line by incorporating exponential or logistic tumor growth, and distinct forms of cell death. Cell line and treatment specific model parameters are then estimated from the experimental data for each model. We analyze all competing models using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and the selection of the best model is made according to the model probabilities (BIC weights). We show that the best model among the candidate set of models depends on the TNBC cell line and the treatment scenario, though, in most cases, there is great uncertainty in choosing the best model. However, we show that the probability of being the best model can be increased by combining treatment data with the same total drug exposure. Our analysis points to the importance of considering multiple models, built on different biological assumptions, to capture the observed variations in tumor growth and treatment response.]]></summary>

A new div FOSLS mixed finite element method is proposed and analyzed for the first-order system of the general second-order elliptic problems in terms of the scalar variable displacement and the vectorial variable flux. The main feature of the proposed method is to apply a local constant element or (bi,tri)linear element

The method is coercive and symmetric, allowing any combination of conforming approximations for both scalar and vectorial variables. More importantly, the method is suitable for general nonaffine quadrilateral Raviart–Thomas (RT) and nonaffine hexahedral Raviart–Thomas–Nédélec (RTN)
