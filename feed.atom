 Abstract. Recent work by public health experts suggests that incorporating human behavior is crucial in faithfully modeling an epidemic. We present a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation SIR-type population model for an epidemic including behavioral concerns. In our model, the disease spreads via mass action, as is customary in compartmental models. However, drawing from social contagion theory, we assume that as the disease spreads and prevention measures are enacted, noncompliance with prevention measures also spreads throughout the population. We prove global existence of classical solutions of our model, and then perform [math]-type analysis and determine asymptotic behavior of the model in different parameter regimes. Finally, we simulate the model and discuss the new facets which distinguish our model from basic SIR-type models.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In the dynamic minimum set cover problem, the challenge is to minimize the update time while guaranteeing a close-to-optimal [math] approximation factor. (Throughout, [math], [math], [math], and [math] are parameters denoting the maximum number of elements, the number of sets, the frequency, and the cost range.) In the high-frequency range, when [math], this was achieved by a deterministic [math]-approximation algorithm with [math] amortized update time by Gupta et al. [Online and dynamic algorithms for set cover, in Proceedings STOC 2017, ACM, pp. 537–550]. In this paper we consider the low-frequency range, when [math], and obtain deterministic algorithms with a [math]-approximation ratio and the foll…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Balanced truncation is a well-established model order reduction method which has been applied to a variety of problems. Recently, a connection between linear Gaussian Bayesian inference problems and the system-theoretic concept of balanced truncation has been drawn (Qian et al in Sci Comput 91:29, 2022). Although this connection is new, the application of balanced truncation to data assimilation is not a novel idea: it has already been used in four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var). This paper discusses the application of balanced truncation to linear Gaussian Bayesian inference, and, in particular, the 4D-Var method, thereby strengthening the link between systems theory and data assimilation further. Similarities between both types of data assimilation problems enable a generalisation of the state-of-the-art approach to the use of arbitrary prior covariances as reachability Gramians. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced approach using time-limited balanced truncation that allows to balance Bayesian inference for unstable systems and in addition improves the numerical results for short observation periods.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We create a novel connection between Boltzmann sampling methods and Devroye’s algorithm to develop highly efficient sampling procedures that generate objects from important combinatorial classes with a given size [math] in expected time [math]. This performance is best possible and significantly improves the state of the art for samplers of subcritical graph classes (such as cactus graphs, outerplanar graphs, and series-parallel graphs), subcritical substitution-closed classes of permutations, Bienaymé–Galton–Watson trees conditioned on their number of leaves, and several further examples. Our approach allows for this high level of universality, as it applies in general to classes admitting bijective encodings by so-called enriched trees, which are rooted trees with additional structures on the offspring of each node.]]></summary>

The solution of nonlinear inverse problems is a challenging task in numerical analysis. In most cases, this kind of problems is solved by iterative procedures that, at each iteration, linearize the problem in a neighborhood of the currently available approximation of the solution. The linearized problem is then solved by a direct or iterative method. Among this class of solution methods, the Gauss–Newton method is one of the most popular ones. We propose an efficient implementation of this method for large-scale problems. Our implementation is based on projecting the nonlinear problem into a sequence of nested subspaces, referred to as Generalized Krylov Subspaces, whose dimension increases with the number of iterations, except for when restarts are carried out. When the computation of the Jacobian matrix is expensive, we combine our iterative method with secant (Broyden) updates to further reduce the computational cost. We show convergence of the proposed solution methods and provide a few numerical examples that illustrate their performance.]]></summary>

In this work, we theoretically and numerically discuss a class of time fractional normal-subdiffusion transport equation, which depicts a crossover from normal diffusion (as 
                      
                      \(t\rightarrow 0\)
                      
                    ) to sub-diffusion (as 
                      
                      \(t\rightarrow \infty \)
                      
                    ). Firstly, the well-posedness and regularities of the model are studied by using the bivariate Mittag-Leffler function. Theoretical results show that after introducing the first-order derivative operator, the regularity of the solution can be improved in substance. Then, a numerical scheme with high-precision is developed no matter the initial value is smooth or non-smooth. More specifically, we use the contour integral method (CIM) with parameterized hyperbolic contour to approximate the temporal local and non-local operators, and employ the standard Galerkin finite element method for spatial discretization. Rigorous error estimates show that the proposed numerical scheme has spectral accuracy in time and optimal convergence order in space. Besides, we further improve the algorithm and reduce the computational cost by using the barycentric Lagrange interpolation. Finally, the obtained theoretical results as well as the acceleration algorithm are verified by several 1-D and 2-D numerical experiments, which also show that the numerical scheme developed in this paper is effective and robust.]]></summary>

In this paper, an implicit scheme is proposed to solve a parabolic variational inequality arising from the American put options. The discretization leads to a class of discrete elliptic variational inequalities. Well-posedness, including existence, uniqueness, comparison principle, and stability of the discrete elliptic variational inequality is established. A simple and efficient algorithm to solve the implicit discretized variational inequality is discovered. The novelty here is an explicit formula for the optimal exercise boundary. An improved algorithm is also presented to eliminate the singularity near the time to expiry. Numerical examples are carried out to show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.]]></summary>

In this paper, we will consider the variable-order subdiffusion initial-boundary value problem with weakly singular solutions. By using the nonuniform L1 scheme and nonuniform Alikhanov scheme in time, two efficient numerical methods (which we call L1 FEM and Alikhanov FEM) are developed, where the finite element method is used in space. Firstly, an improved error analysis is given for the L1 FEM of Huang and Chen (Appl Math Lett 139:108559, 2023), and the derived error bounds remain valid as

                     are presented. Combining these two results with an

In this paper, we propose a unified primal-dual algorithm framework based on the augmented Lagrangian function for composite convex problems with conic inequality constraints. The new framework is highly versatile. First, it not only covers many existing algorithms such as PDHG, Chambolle–Pock, GDA, OGDA and linearized ALM, but also guides us to design a new efficient algorithm called Semi-OGDA (SOGDA). Second, it enables us to study the role of the augmented penalty term in the convergence analysis. Interestingly, a properly selected penalty not only improves the numerical performance of the above methods, but also theoretically enables the convergence of algorithms like PDHG and SOGDA. Under properly designed step sizes and penalty term, our unified framework preserves the

We develop a universally applicable embedded boundary finite difference method, which results in a symmetric positive definite linear system and does not suffer from small cell stiffness. Our discretization is efficient for the wave, heat and Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. When the system needs to be inverted we can use the conjugate gradient method, accelerated by algebraic multigrid techniques. A series of numerical tests for the wave, heat and Poisson equation and applications to shape optimization problems verify the accuracy, stability, and efficiency of our method. Our fast computational techniques can be extended to moving boundary problems (e.g. Stefan problem), to the Navier–Stokes equations, and to the Grad-Shafranov equations for which problems are posed on domains with complex geometry and fast simulations are of great interest.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
The existing shift technique for quaternion matrix computation is to use real shifts rather than quaternion shifts, because quaternions are multiplicatively non-commutative in general. This becomes the obstacle to the development of fast and stable algorithms for computing partial quaternion eigenpairs. To overcome this difficulty, a new inverse quaternion iteration with quaternion shift is derived for solving general right quaternion eigenvalue problem. Fixed and updated quaternion shift techniques are developed to speed up the convergence. The advantage of quaternion shifts is explained geometrically, as well as the fact that real shifts may lead to wrong results. The convergence theory is built in a different way to that in real and complex cases. Numerical experiments on simulated data and color face database demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the newly proposed method over the state-of-the-art algorithms.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper concerns the derivation of radiative transfer equations for acoustic waves propagating in a randomly fluctuating half-space in the weak-scattering regime, and the study of boundary effects through an asymptotic analysis of the Wigner transform of the wave solution. These radiative transfer equations allow one to model the transport of wave energy density, taking into account the scattering by random heterogeneities. The approach builds on the method of images, where the half-space problem is extended to a full-space, with two symmetric sources and an even map of mechanical properties. Two contributions to the total energy density are then identified: one similar to the energy density propagation in a full-space, for which the resulting lack of statistical stationarity of the medium properties has no leading-order effect; and one supported within one wavelength of the boundary, which describes interference effects between the waves produced by the two symmetric sources. In the case of a homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, this boundary effect yields a doubling of the intensity, and in the case of homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, a canceling of that intensity.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We analyze the searching strategies of a forager diffusing in the whole space via an equation of fractional type. Specifically, the diffusion of the forager is regulated by a Lévy flight whose exponent can be chosen in order to optimize a suitable foraging efficiency functional. Here, the dimension of the space is arbitrary. On the one hand, we show that the exponent [math] corresponding to the limit case of heavy-tailed Lévy flights is a pessimizer for the efficiency functional. On the other hand, we prove that, in situations of biological interest, one finds the most rewarding strategies arbitrarily close to [math]. The combination of these results gives that the most rewarding searching option may turn out to be unfeasible, or at least unreliable, in practice, since small perturbations of the optimal searching exponent lead to pessimal patterns. The cases analyzed specifically are those of a target located in the proximity of the forager and that of sparse prey modeled by a target infinitely far from the initial position of the seeker. The efficiency functionals taken into account are either of pointwise type (in which the predator and the prey are modeled by moving points) or of set-dependent type (in which the predator and the prey correspond to regions of space with uniform density, thus modeling also the case of a sight range of the biological individuals involved). To implement our analysis, we also provide a number of structural results about finiteness, continuity, and asymptotic behaviors of the efficiency functionals. It is suggestive to relate the adoption of the most rewarding searching pattern close to pessimizers to a “high-risk/high-gain” strategy, in which the forager aims at high-energy content prey to mitigate the risk of failure. This setting is also connected to foraging modes of “ambush” type.]]></summary>

Standard discontinuous Galerkin finite element solutions to convection-dominated convection–diffusion equations usually possess sharp layers but also exhibit large spurious oscillations. Slope limiters are known as a post-processing technique to reduce these unphysical values. This paper studies the application of deep neural networks for detecting mesh cells on which slope limiters should be applied. The networks are trained with data obtained from simulations of a standard benchmark problem with linear finite elements. It is investigated how they perform when applied to discrete solutions obtained with higher order finite elements and to solutions for a different benchmark problem.]]></summary>

We present a discontinuity detection method based on the so-called null rules, computed as a vector in the null space of certain collocation matrices. These rules are used as weights in a linear combination of function evaluations to indicate the local behavior of the function itself. By analyzing the asymptotic properties of the rules, we introduce two indicators (one for discontinuities of the function and one for discontinuities of its gradient) by locally computing just one rule. This leads to an efficient and reliable scheme, which allows us to effectively detect and classify points close to discontinuities. We then show how this information can be suitably combined with adaptive approximation methods based on hierarchical spline spaces in the reconstruction process of surfaces with discontinuities. The considered adaptive methods exploit the ability of the hierarchical spaces to be locally refined, and fault detection is a natural way to guide the refinement with low computational cost. A selection of test cases is presented to show the effectiveness of our approach.]]></summary>

Inspired by several numerical methods for finding multiple solutions, a partial Newton-correction method (PNCM) is proposed to find multiple fixed points of semi-linear differential operators. First a new augmented singular transform is developed to form a barrier so that an algorithm search outside the subspace generated by previously found fixed points cannot pass the barrier and penetrate into the inside to reach an old fixed point. Thus a fixed point found by an algorithm must be new. Its mathematical validations are established. A flow chart of PNCM is presented. Then a more accurate Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto pseudospectral scheme is constructed and convertes a semi-linear fixed point problem into a linear partial differential equation and an algebraic equation. It greatly simplifies the computation. Finally numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of these approaches.]]></summary>

Explicit step-truncation tensor methods have recently proven successful in integrating initial value problems for high-dimensional partial differential equations. However, the combination of non-linearity and stiffness may introduce time-step restrictions which could make explicit integration computationally infeasible. To overcome this problem, we develop a new class of implicit rank-adaptive algorithms for temporal integration of nonlinear evolution equations on tensor manifolds. These algorithms are based on performing one time step with a conventional time-stepping scheme, followed by an implicit fixed point iteration step involving a rank-adaptive truncation operation onto a tensor manifold. Implicit step truncation methods are straightforward to implement as they rely only on arithmetic operations between tensors, which can be performed by efficient and scalable parallel algorithms. Numerical applications demonstrating the effectiveness of implicit step-truncation tensor integrators are presented and discussed for the Allen–Cahn equation, the Fokker–Planck equation, and the nonlinear Schrödinger equation.]]></summary>

Thanks to their universal approximation properties and new efficient training strategies, Deep Neural Networks are becoming a valuable tool for the approximation of mathematical operators. In the present work, we introduce Mesh-Informed Neural Networks (MINNs), a class of architectures specifically tailored to handle mesh based functional data, and thus of particular interest for reduced order modeling of parametrized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The driving idea behind MINNs is to embed hidden layers into discrete functional spaces of increasing complexity, obtained through a sequence of meshes defined over the underlying spatial domain. The approach leads to a natural pruning strategy which enables the design of sparse architectures that are able to learn general nonlinear operators. We assess this strategy through an extensive set of numerical experiments, ranging from nonlocal operators to nonlinear diffusion PDEs, where MINNs are compared against more traditional architectures, such as classical fully connected Deep Neural Networks, but also more recent ones, such as DeepONets and Fourier Neural Operators. Our results show that MINNs can handle functional data defined on general domains of any shape, while ensuring reduced training times, lower computational costs, and better generalization capabilities, thus making MINNs very well-suited for demanding applications such as Reduced Order Modeling and Uncertainty Quantification for PDEs.]]></summary>

This work presents an adaptive superfast proximal augmented Lagrangian (AS-PAL) method for solving linearly-constrained smooth nonconvex composite optimization problems. Each iteration of AS-PAL inexactly solves a possibly nonconvex proximal augmented Lagrangian (AL) subproblem obtained by an aggressive/adaptive choice of prox stepsize with the aim of substantially improving its computational performance followed by a full Lagrange multiplier update. A major advantage of AS-PAL compared to other AL methods is that it requires no knowledge of parameters (e.g., size of constraint matrix, objective function curvatures, etc) associated with the optimization problem, due to its adaptive nature not only in choosing the prox stepsize but also in using a crucial adaptive accelerated composite gradient variant to solve the proximal AL subproblems. The speed and efficiency of AS-PAL is demonstrated through extensive computational experiments showing that it can solve many instances more than ten times faster than other state-of-the-art penalty and AL methods, particularly when high accuracy is required.]]></summary>
