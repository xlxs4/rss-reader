 Abstract. In this research, we propose an online basis enrichment strategy within the framework of a recently developed constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale discontinuous Galerkin method. Combining the technique of oversampling, one makes use of the information of the current residuals to adaptively construct basis functions in the online stage to reduce the error of multiscale approximation. A complete analysis of the method is presented, which shows the proposed online enrichment leads to a fast convergence from multiscale approximation to the fine-scale solution. The error reduction can be made sufficiently large by suitably selecting oversampling regions and the number of oversampling layers. Further, the convergence rate of the enrichment algorithm depends on a factor of exponential decay regarding the number of oversampling layers and a user-defined parameter. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed online adaptive algorithm.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We present a butterfly-compressed representation of the Hadamard–Babich (HB) ansatz for the Green’s function of the high-frequency Helmholtz equation in smooth inhomogeneous media. For a computational domain discretized with [math] discretization cells, the proposed algorithm first solves and tabulates the phase and HB coefficients via eikonal and transport equations with observation points and point sources located at the Chebyshev nodes using a set of much coarser computation grids, and then butterfly compresses the resulting HB interactions from all [math] cell centers to each other. The overall CPU time and memory requirement scale as [math] for any bounded two-dimensional (2D) domains with arbitrary excitation sources. A direct extension of this scheme to bounded 3D domains yields an [math] CPU complexity, which can be further reduced to quasi-linear complexities with proposed remedies. The scheme can also efficiently handle scattering problems involving inclusions in inhomogeneous media. Although the current construction of our HB integrator does not accommodate caustics, the resulting HB integrator itself can be applied to certain sources, such as concave-shaped sources, to produce caustic effects. Compared to finite-difference frequency domain methods, the proposed HB integrator is free of numerical dispersion and requires fewer discretization points per wavelength. As a result, it can solve wave propagation problems well beyond the capability of existing solvers. Remarkably, the proposed scheme can accurately model wave propagation in 2D domains with 640 wavelengths per direction and in 3D domains with 54 wavelengths per direction on a state-of-the-art supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this article we develop the constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) for elliptic partial differential equations with inhomogeneous Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions, and the high contrast property emerges from the coefficients of elliptic operators and Robin boundary conditions. By careful construction of multiscale bases of the CEM-GMsFEM, we introduce two operators [math] and [math] which are used to handle inhomogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary values and are also proved to converge independently of contrast ratios as enlarging oversampling regions. We providean a priori error estimate and show that the number of oversampling layers is the key factor in controlling numerical errors. A series of experiments are conducted, and those results reflect the reliability of our methods even with high contrast ratios.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we present strong numerical evidence that the incompressible axisymmetric Euler equations with degenerate viscosity coefficients and smooth initial data of finite energy develop a potential finite-time locally self-similar singularity at the origin. An important feature of this potential singularity is that the solution develops a two-scale traveling wave that travels toward the origin. The two-scale feature is characterized by the scaling property that the center of the traveling wave is located at a ring of radius [math] surrounding the symmetry axis while the thickness of the ring collapses at a rate [math]. The driving mechanism for this potential singularity is due to an antisymmetric vortex dipole that generates a strong shearing layer in both the radial and axial velocity fields. Without the viscous regularization, the three-dimensional Euler equations develop a sharp front and some shearing instability in the far field. On the other hand, the Navier–Stokes equations with a constant viscosity coefficient regularize the two-scale solution structure and do not develop a finite-time singularity for the same initial data.]]></summary>

In this work, we propose a model order reduction framework to deal with inverse problems in a non-intrusive setting. Inverse problems, especially in a partial differential equation context, require a huge computational load due to the iterative optimization process. To accelerate such a procedure, we apply a numerical pipeline that involves artificial neural networks to parametrize the boundary conditions of the problem in hand, compress the dimensionality of the (full-order) snapshots, and approximate the parametric solution manifold. It derives a general framework capable to provide an ad-hoc parametrization of the inlet boundary and quickly converges to the optimal solution thanks to model order reduction. We present in this contribution the results obtained by applying such methods to two different CFD test cases.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We develop a probabilistic characterization of trajectorial divergence rates in nonautonomous stochastic dynamical systems that are systematically shown to be suitable for uncertainty quantification in Lagrangian (trajectory-based) predictions. We construct scalar fields of finite-time divergence rates which are rooted in information theory/geometry, and we show their existence and space-time continuity for general stochastic flows. Combining these divergence rate fields with information inequalities derived in [M. Branicki and K. Uda, SIAM/ASA J. Uncertain. Quantif., 9 (2021), pp. 1242–1313] allows for a principled quantification of Lagrangian uncertainty in a given dynamics, as well as a mitigation of the uncertainty in path-based observables estimated from simplified models of the truth/reference dynamics in a way that is amenable to algorithmic implementations. This approach can be utilized in information-geometric analysis of statistical estimation and inference, as well as in a data-driven machine learning of reduced-order models. We also derive a link between the divergence rates and finite-time Lyapunov exponents for probability measures and for path-based observables.]]></summary>

 Abstract. It is well known for experts that resonances in nonlinear systems lead to new invariant objects that lead to new behaviors. The goal of this paper is to study the invariant sets generated by resonances under foliation preserving torus maps. They are a special kind of torus maps which preserve a foliation of irrational lines [math]. Foliation preserving maps appear naturally as a reparameterization of linear flows in the torus and also play an important role in several applications involving coupled oscillators, delay equations, resonators with moving walls, etc. The invariant objects we find here lead to predictions on the behavior of these models. Since the results of this paper are meant to be applied to other problems, we have developed very quantitative results giving explicit descriptions of the phenomena and the invariant objects that control them. The structure of the phase locking regions for foliation preserving maps is different than for generic maps of the torus. Indeed, for the sake of completeness, we have developed a similar analysis for the case of generic maps of the torus and shown that the objects that appear in foliation preserving maps are quantitatively and qualitatively different from those of generic torus maps. This has consequences in applications.]]></summary>

The equation of state (EOS) embodies thermodynamic properties of compressible fluid materials and usually has very complicated forms in real engineering applications. The complexity of EOS in form gives rise to the difficulty in analyzing relevant wave patterns and in designing efficient numerical algorithms. In this paper, a strategy of local stiffened gas approximation is proposed for computing compressible fluid flows of real materials. The stiffened gas EOS is used to approximate general EOSs locally with certain thermodynamic compatibility at each interface of computational control volumes so that the exact Riemann solver can be significantly simplified and the computational cost of the resulting scheme is reduced up to two orders of magnitude. Then the generalized Riemann problem solver is further adopted not only to increase the accuracy and resolution but also to effectively reflect the thermodynamic effect through the inclusion of entropy variation into the numerical fluxes. The resulting scheme is demonstrated to be efficient and robust through typical numerical examples which display the excellent performance of such an approximation under extreme thermodynamics.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Many physical, epidemiological, or physiological dynamical processes on networks support front-like propagation, where an initial localized perturbation grows and systematically invades all nodes in the network. A key problem is then to extract estimates for the dynamics. In particular, if a single node is seeded at a small concentration, when will other nodes reach the same initial concentration? Here, motivated by the study of toxic protein propagation in neurodegenerative diseases, we present and compare three different estimates for the arrival time in order of increasing analytical complexity: the linear arrival time, obtained by linearizing the underlying dynamical system; the Lambert time, obtained by considering the interaction of pairs of nodes; and the nonlinear arrival time, obtained by asymptotic techniques. We use the classic Fisher–Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov equation as a paradigm for the dynamics and show that each method provides different insights but consistent time estimates. Further, we show that the nonlinear asymptotic method also gives an approximate solution, valid in the entire domain, and the correct ordering of arrival regions over large regions of parameters and initial conditions.]]></summary>

Data used in particle physics analyses have an imbalanced nature in which the events of interest are rare due to the broad background. These events can be identified from bulk by intensive computational studies including application of sophisticated analysis techniques. Classification algorithms provided by supervised machine learning (ML) approaches can be utilized to interpret skewed particle dataset as an alternative to the classic techniques even for multi particle state analysis.

For this purpose, five widely used oversampling and two hybrid strategies, using over and under resampling together, were adjusted to RFC. Moreover, class weights applied RFC, weighted random forest (WRF), was used in the analysis. Due to the data structure, performance of the applied models was evaluated by the derivatives of confusion matrix. It is revealed that hybrid techniques implemented in RFC is suitable for handling highly imbalanced classes.

The quadrature-based method of moments (QMOM) offers a promising class of approximation techniques for reducing kinetic equations to fluid equations that are valid beyond thermodynamic equilibrium. In this work, we study a particular five-moment variant of QMOM known as HyQMOM and establish that this system is moment-invertible over a convex region in solution space. We then develop a high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for solving the resulting fluid system. The scheme is based on a predictor–corrector approach, where the prediction is a localized space-time DG scheme. The nonlinear algebraic system in this prediction is solved using a Picard iteration. The correction is a straightforward explicit update based on the time-integral of the evolution equation, where the space-time prediction replaces all instances of the exact solution. In the absence of limiters, the high-order scheme does not guarantee that solutions remain in the convex set over which HyQMOM is moment-realizable. To overcome this, we introduce novel limiters that rigorously guarantee that the computed solution does not leave the convex set of realizable solutions, thus guaranteeing the hyperbolicity of the system. We develop positivity-preserving limiters in both the prediction and correction steps and an oscillation limiter that damps unphysical oscillations near shocks. We also develop a novel extension of this scheme to include a BGK collision operator; the proposed method is shown to be asymptotic-preserving in the high-collision limit. The HyQMOM and the HyQMOM-BGK solvers are verified on several test cases, demonstrating high-order accuracy on smooth problems and shock-capturing capability on problems with shocks. The asymptotic-preserving property of the HyQMOM-BGK solver is also numerically verified.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
The study of uncertainty propagation poses a great challenge to design high fidelity numerical methods. Based on the stochastic Galerkin formulation, this paper addresses the idea and implementation of the first flux reconstruction scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws with random inputs. High-order numerical approximation is adopted simultaneously in physical and random space, i.e., the modal representation of solutions is based on an orthogonal polynomial basis and the nodal representation is based on solution collocation points. Therefore, the numerical behaviors of the scheme in the (physical-random) phase space can be designed and understood uniformly. A family of filters is developed in multi-dimensional cases to mitigate the Gibbs phenomenon arising from discontinuities in both physical and random space. The filter function is switched on and off by the dynamic detection of discontinuous solutions, and a slope limiter is employed to preserve the positivity of physically realizable solutions. As a result, the proposed method is able to capture the stochastic flow evolution where resolved and unresolved regions coexist. Numerical experiments including a wave propagation, a Burgers’ shock, a one-dimensional Riemann problem, and a two-dimensional shock-vortex interaction problem are presented to validate the current scheme. The order of convergence of the high-order scheme is identified. The capability of the scheme for simulating smooth and discontinuous stochastic flow dynamics is demonstrated. The open-source codes to reproduce the numerical results are available under the MIT license (Xiao et al. in FRSG: stochastic Galerkin method with flux reconstruction. https://github.com/CSMMLab/FRSG, (2021). https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5588317).]]></summary>

 Abstract. We consider a model of dynamics of the immune system. The model is based on three factors: occasional boosting and continuous waning of immunity and a general description of the period between subsequent boosting events. The antibody concentration changes according to a non-Markovian process. The density of the distribution of this concentration satisfies some partial differential equation with an integral boundary condition. We check whether this system generates a stochastic semigroup and we study the long-time behavior of this semigroup. In particular we prove a theorem on its asymptotic stability.]]></summary>

In this paper we analyze a fully discrete scheme for a general Cahn–Hilliard equation coupled with a nonsteady Magneto-hydrodynamics flow, which describes two immiscible, incompressible and electrically conducting fluids with different mobilities, fluid viscosities and magnetic diffusivities. A typical fully discrete scheme, which is comprised of conforming finite element method and the Euler semi-implicit discretization based on a convex splitting of the energy of the equation is considered in detail. We prove that our scheme is unconditionally energy stable and obtain some optimal error estimates for the concentration field, the chemical potential, the velocity field, the magnetic field and the pressure.

In this work, we consider numerical approximations of a thermally coupled incompressible magnetohydrodynamic problem. By combining the scalar auxiliary variable method and vector penalty projection approach, we construct a fully decoupled, unconditionally stable finite element scheme to solve this nonlinear and coupled multi-physics system efficiently. The proposed scheme has three distinct features: (i) although the nonlinear term is treated explicitly, the scheme is still unconditionally stable; (ii) it can approximate divergence-free solution, when penalty parameter tends to zero; (iii) all unknown physical quantities are decoupled, and only a series of linear elliptic equations with constant coefficient need to be solved. Moreover, the presented scheme is provably unconditionally stable. Then error estimates for the velocity field, magnetic field and temperature of the fully discrete scheme are established. Finally, various numerical simulations are provided to verify the features of the presented scheme.]]></summary>

Theoretically, the conditional expectation of a square-integrable random variable Y given a d-dimensional random vector X can be obtained by minimizing the mean squared distance between Y and f(X) over all Borel measurable functions 
                      
                      \(f :\mathbb {R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb {R}\)
                      
                    . However, in many applications this minimization problem cannot be solved exactly, and instead, a numerical method which computes an approximate minimum over a suitable subfamily of Borel functions has to be used. The quality of the result depends on the adequacy of the subfamily and the performance of the numerical method. In this paper, we derive an expected value representation of the minimal mean squared distance which in many applications can efficiently be approximated with a standard Monte Carlo average. This enables us to provide guarantees for the accuracy of any numerical approximation of a given conditional expectation. We illustrate the method by assessing the quality of approximate conditional expectations obtained by linear, polynomial and neural network regression in different concrete examples.]]></summary>

The generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) is a kind of game to find strategies for a group of players such that each player’s objective function is optimized. Solutions for GNEPs are called generalized Nash equilibria (GNEs). In this paper, we propose a numerical method for finding GNEs of GNEPs of polynomials based on the polyhedral homotopy continuation and the Moment-SOS hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations. We show that our method can find all GNEs if they exist, or detect the nonexistence of GNEs, under some genericity assumptions. Some numerical experiments are made to demonstrate the efficiency of our method.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study an optimal transportation approach for recovering parameters in dynamical systems with a single smoothly varying attractor. We assume that the data are not sufficient for estimating time derivatives of state variables but enough to approximate the long-time behavior of the system through an approximation of its physical measure. Thus, we fit physical measures by taking the Wasserstein distance from optimal transportation as a misfit function between two probability distributions. In particular, we analyze the regularity of the resulting loss function for general transportation costs and derive gradient formulas. Physical measures are approximated as fixed points of suitable PDE-based Perron–Frobenius operators. Test cases discussed in the paper include common low-dimensional dynamical systems.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study stochastic perturbations of ODEs with stable limit cycles — referred to as stochastic oscillators — and investigate the response of the asymptotic (in time) frequency of oscillations to changing noise amplitude. Unlike previous studies, we do not restrict our attention to the small-noise limit, and we account for the fact that large deviation events may push the system out of its oscillatory regime. To do so, we consider stochastic oscillators conditioned on their remaining in an oscillatory regime for all time. This leads us to use the theory of quasi-ergodic measures, and to define quasi-asymptotic frequencies as conditional, long-time average frequencies. We show that quasi-asymptotic frequencies exist under minimal assumptions, though they may or may not be observable in practice. Our discussion recovers and expands upon previous results on stochastic oscillators in the literature. In particular, existing results imply that the asymptotic frequency of a stochastic oscillator depends quadratically on the noise amplitude. We describe scenarios where this prediction holds, though we also show that it is not true in general — potentially, even for small noise.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is an efficient tool for decomposing spatio-temporal data into a set of low-dimensional modes, yielding the oscillation frequencies and the growth rates of physically significant modes. In this paper, we propose a novel DMD model that can be used for dynamical systems affected by multiplicative noise. We first derive a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator for the data-based model decomposition of a linear dynamical system corrupted by certain multiplicative noise. Applying penalty relaxation to the MAP estimator, we obtain the proposed DMD model whose epigraphical limits are the MAP estimator and the conventional optimized DMD model. We also propose an efficient alternating gradient descent method for solving the proposed DMD model and analyze its convergence behavior. The proposed model is demonstrated on both the synthetic data and the numerically generated one-dimensional combustor data and is shown to have superior reconstruction properties compared to state-of-the-art DMD models. Considering that multiplicative noise is ubiquitous in numerous dynamical systems, the proposed DMD model opens up new possibilities for accurate data-based modal decomposition.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the qualitative behavior of a model to represent local regulation in a metabolic network. The model is based on the end-product control structure introduced in [A. Goelzer et al., BMC Syst.  Biol., 2 (2008), 20]. In this class of regulation, the metabolite effector is the end product of a metabolic pathway. We suppose the input to the pathway to switch between zero and a positive value according to the concentration of the metabolite effector. Considering the switching system as a differential inclusion, we prove that it converges to a globally uniformly asymptotically stable equilibrium point, reaches the sliding mode, or oscillates around the sliding mode depending on the positive value of the input. Finally, we show that in any case the solution of the switching system is the limit of solutions of equation sequences with smooth or piecewise linear inputs.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we develop a family of third order asymptotic-preserving (AP) and asymptotically accurate (AA) diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta (DIRK) time discretization methods for the stiff hyperbolic relaxation systems and kinetic Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) model in the semi-Lagrangian (SL) setting. The methods are constructed based on an accuracy analysis of the SL scheme for stiff hyperbolic relaxation systems and kinetic BGK model in the limiting fluid regime when the Knudsen number approaches 0. An extra order condition for the asymptotic third order accuracy in the limiting regime is derived. Linear von Neumann stability analysis of the proposed third order DIRK methods are performed to a simplified two-velocity linear kinetic model. Extensive numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the AA, AP, and stability properties of our proposed schemes.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This work focuses on angular values of nonautonomous dynamical systems which have been introduced for general random and (non)autonomous dynamical systems in a previous publication [W.-J. Beyn, G. Froyland, and T. Hls, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 21 (2022), pp. 1245–1286]. The angular value of dimension [math] measures the maximal average rotation which an [math]-dimensional subspace of the phase space experiences through the dynamics of a discrete-time linear system. Our main results relate the notion of angular value to the well-known dichotomy (or Sacker–Sell) spectrum and its associated spectral bundles. In particular, we prove a reduction theorem which shows that instead of maximizing over all subspaces, it suffices to maximize over so-called trace spaces which have their basis in the spectral fibers. The reduction leads to an algorithm for computing angular values of dimensions one and two. We apply the algorithm to several systems of dimension up to [math] and demonstrate its efficiency to detect the fastest rotating subspace even if it is not dominant under the forward dynamics.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We consider a deterministic model of a rock-paper-scissors ([math]) cyclic ecological system. The model accounts for species mobility via Fickian diffusion, as well as interspecies interactions describing the cyclic competition scheme. The system admits both single-species equilibria (saddles) and a three-species coexistence equilibrium state. We focus on the regime where coexistence is unstable. When there is no spatial dependence, the solution of the corresponding ordinary differential equation ([math]) system admits an attracting heteroclinic cycle consisting of orbits connecting the three single-species saddles in the [math] sequence, to which most solutions with physical initial condit…]]></summary>

 Abstract.  We consider the incompressible hyperdissipative Navier–Stokes equations  \begin{align}\left \{\begin{array}{l} u_t+\epsilon (-\Delta )^\alpha u+(u\cdot \nabla )u+\nabla p=f,\\ \nabla \cdot u=0, \end{array} \right .\end{align}  on a two- or three-dimensional periodic torus, where the power [math] and the forcing function [math] is time-dependent. We intend to reveal how the fractional dissipation and the time-dependent force affect long-time dynamics of weak solutions. More precisely, we prove that with certain conditions on [math], there exists a finite-dimensional Lipschitz manifold in the [math]-space of divergent-free vector fields with zero mean. The manifold is locally forward invariant and pullback exponentially attracting. Moreover, the compact uniform attractor is contained in the union of all fibers of the manifold. In our result, no large viscosity [math] is assumed. It is also significant that in the three-dimensional case the spectrum of the fractional Laplacian [math] does not have arbitrarily large gaps.]]></summary>

Dynamical systems that involve non-linearity of the dynamics is a major challenge encountered in learning these systems. Similarly, the lack of adequate models for phenomena that reflect the governing physics can be an obstacle to an appropriate analysis. Nonetheless, some numerically or experimentally measured data can be found. Based on this data, and using a data-driven method such as the Loewner framework, it is possible to manage this data to derive a high fidelity reduced dynamical system that mimics the behaviour of the original data. In this paper, we tackle the issue of large amount of data presented by samples of transfer functions in a frequency-domain. The main step in this framework consists in computing singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Loewner matrix which provides accurate reduced systems. However, the large amount of data prevents this decomposition from being computed properly. We exploit the fact that the Loewner and shifted Loewner matrices, the key tools of Loewner framework, satisfy certain large scale Sylvester matrix equations. Using an extended block Krylov subspace method, a good approximation in a factored form of the Loewner and shifted Loewner matrices can be obtained and a minimal computation cost of the SVD is ensured. This method facilitates the process of a large amount of data and guarantees a good quality of the inferred model at the end of the process. Accuracy and efficiency of our method are assessed in the final section.]]></summary>

Compared with the classical chemotaxis-Navier–Stokes system, the newly modified system obeys the law of energy dissipation. To solve such a chemotaxis-fluid system, we develop a linear, decoupled fully-discrete finite element scheme by combining the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach, implicit-explicit (IMEX) scheme and pressure-projection method. The unconditional energy stability of the developed scheme is proved rigorously, and we further prove the optimal error estimates for the fully discrete scheme, especially for the pressure bound. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to verify the accuracy, energy stability and performance of the proposed numerical scheme.]]></summary>

We first motivate our work with realistic examples from nano-electronics, high field magnets and ophthalmology. We then define a general framework stemming from the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin method that accounts naturally for the IBC and we provide a complete analysis at continuous and discrete levels. The implementation in the Feel++framework is then detailed and the convergence and scalability properties are verified.

We propose a family of mixed finite elements that are robust for the nearly incompressible strain gradient model, which is a fourth-order singular perturbed elliptic system. The element is similar to [C. Taylor and P. Hood, Comput. & Fluids, 1(1973), 73–100] in the Stokes flow. Using a uniform discrete B-B inequality for the mixed finite element pairs, we show the optimal rate of convergence that is robust in the incompressible limit. By a new regularity result that is uniform in both the materials parameter and the incompressibility, we prove the method converges with 1/2 order to the solution with strong boundary layer effects. Moreover, we estimate the convergence rate of the numerical solution to the unperturbed second-order elliptic system. Numerical results for both smooth solutions and the solutions with sharp layers confirm the theoretical prediction.]]></summary>

There exist several discretization techniques for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. In addition to classical finite difference, finite element and finite volume techniques, a more recent approach employs radial basis functions to generate differentiation stencils on unstructured point sets. This approach, abbreviated by RBF-FD (radial basis function-finite difference), has gained in popularity since it enjoys several advantages: It is (relatively) straightforward, does not require a mesh and generalizes easily to higher spatial dimensions. However, its application is not quite as blackbox as it may appear at first sight.

 Abstract. We study the problem of computing the [math] norm of a matrix [math], defined as [math]. This problem generalizes the spectral norm of a matrix ([math]) and the Grothendieck problem ([math], [math]) and has been widely studied in various regimes. When [math], the problem exhibits a dichotomy: constant factor approximation algorithms are known if [math], and the problem is hard to approximate within almost polynomial factors when [math]. The regime when [math], known as hypercontractive norms, is particularly significant for various applications but much less well understood. The case with [math] and [math] was studied by Barak et al. [Proceedings of the 44th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2012, pp. 307–326], who gave subexponential algorithms for a promise version of the problem (which captures small-set expansion) and also proved hardness of approximation results based on the exponential time hypothesis. However, no NP-hardness of approximation is known for these problems for any [math]. We prove the first NP-hardness result (under randomized reductions) for approximating hypercontractive norms. We show that for any [math] with [math], [math] is hard to approximate within [math] assuming [math]. En route to the above result, we also prove almost tight results for the case when [math] with [math].]]></summary>

 Abstract. We describe algorithms to efficiently compute minimum [math]-cuts and global minimum cuts of undirected surface-embedded graphs. Given an edge-weighted undirected graph [math] with [math] vertices embedded on an orientable surface of genus [math], our algorithms can solve either problem in [math] or [math] time, whichever is better. When [math] is a constant, our [math] time algorithms match the best running times known for computing minimum cuts in planar graphs. Our algorithms for minimum cuts rely on reductions to the problem of finding a minimum-weight subgraph in a given [math]-homology class, and we give efficient algorithms for this latter problem as well. If [math] is embedded on a surface with genus [math] and [math] boundary components, these algorithms run in [math] and [math] time. We also prove that finding a minimum-weight subgraph homologous to a single input cycle is NP-hard, showing that it is likely impossible to improve upon the exponential dependencies on [math] for this latter problem.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The approximate graph coloring problem, whose complexity is unresolved in most cases, concerns finding a [math]-coloring of a graph that is promised to be [math]-colorable, where [math]. This problem naturally generalizes to promise graph homomorphism problems and further to promise constraint satisfaction problems. The complexity of these problems has recently been studied through an algebraic approach. In this paper, we introduce two new techniques to analyze the complexity of promise CSPs: one is based on topology and the other on adjunction. We apply these techniques, together with the previously introduced algebraic approach, to obtain new unconditional NP-hardness results for a significant class of approximate graph coloring and promise graph homomorphism problems.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We consider the problem of computing a (pure) Bayes–Nash equilibrium in the first-price auction with continuous value distributions and discrete bidding space. We prove that when bidders have independent subjective prior beliefs about the value distributions of the other bidders, computing an [math]-equilibrium of the auction is PPAD-complete, and computing an exact equilibrium is FIXP-complete. We also provide an efficient algorithm for solving a special case of the problem for a fixed number of bidders and available bids.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The oxygen depletion problem is an implicit moving boundary value problem. The dynamics allow topological changes in the moving boundary. We show several mathematical formulations of this model from the literature and give a new formulation based on a gradient flow with constraint. All formulations are shown to be equivalent. We explore the possibilities for the numerical approximation of the problem that arise from the different formulations. We show a convergence result for an approximation based on the gradient flow with constraint formulation that applies to the general dynamics including topological changes. More general (vector, higher order) implicit moving boundary value problems are discussed. Several open problems are described.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal arising from biological tissues can be numerically simulated by solving the Bloch–Torrey partial differential equation. Numerical simulations can facilitate the investigation of the relationship between the diffusion MRI signals and cellular structures. With the rapid advance of available computing power, the diffusion MRI community has begun to employ numerical simulations for model formulation and validation, as well as for imaging sequence optimization. Existing simulation frameworks use the finite difference method, the finite element method, or the Matrix Formalism method to solve the Bloch–Torrey partial differential equation. We propose a new method based on the efficient evaluation of layer potentials. In this paper, the mathematical framework and the numerical implementation of the new method are described. We demonstrate the convergence of our method via numerical experiments and analyze the errors linked to various model and simulation parameters. Since our method provides a Fourier-type representation of the diffusion MRI signal, it can potentially facilitate new physical and biological signal interpretations in the future.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We introduce a mathematical model of savanna vegetation dynamics. The usual approach of nonequilibrium ecology is extended by including the impact of wet and dry seasons. We present and rigorously analyze a model describing a mixed woodland-grassland ecosystem with stochastic environmental noise in the form of vegetation biomass losses manifesting fires. Both the probability of ignition and the strength of these losses depend on the current season (as well as vegetation growth rates, etc.). Formally it requires an introduction and analysis of a system that is a piecewise deterministic Markov process with parameters switching between given constant periods of time. We study the long time behavior of time averages for such processes.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Motivated by recent laboratory experiments, we study microbial populations with light-inducible genetic differentiation that generates a two-species microbial consortium relevant for bioproduction. First, we derive a hierarchy of models describing the evolution of the microbial populations, each with decreasing complexity. This sequential order reduction reveals the connections between several popular classes of models used in this context. Second, we demonstrate the analytical insight the order reduction provides by studying the optimal control of such a reduced-order system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Appealing to Pontryagin’s maximum principle, we find different optimal control structures within different regions of the parameter space. Explicit solutions are obtained in a subset of parameter space, while, for the remainder of parameter space, closed-form solutions are obtained that depend on a scalar value that solves a particular transcendental equation. We show that a unique solution of the scalar equation exists and lies in a known compact interval, making its numerical approximation particularly easy. The analytical results are verified against direct numerical calculations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We consider a scalar Fermi–Pasta–Ulam (FPU) system on a square two-dimensional lattice. The Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (KP-II) equation can be derived by means of multiple scale expansions to describe unidirectional long waves of small amplitude with slowly varying transverse modulations. We show that the KP-II approximation makes correct predictions about the dynamics of the original FPU system. An existing approximation result is extended to an arbitrary direction of wave propagation. The main novelty of this work is the use of a Fourier transform in the analysis of the FPU system in strain variables.]]></summary>
