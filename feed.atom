 Abstract. Modeling diffusive processes via a constant effective diffusivity value taken to represent realistic uncertainty or heterogeneity is entrenched in scientific and engineering applications. This brings forth the question, to what extent does the flow pattern changes when symmetry is broken by anisotropy. This study supplies the answer by deriving a class of tridimensional solutions to the steady nonlinear diffusion equation in a spherical domain divided into an arbitrary number of meridian sectors with distinct diffusivities and generation rates. The new family of solutions permits flexible modeling, where traditionally only isotropic radial transport was considered. The flow patterns support an extensive variety of topological terrain via tesseral and sectoral harmonics. The anisotropy gives rise to an unconventional type of a fixed point combining both node and saddle attributes. The contours are nonsmooth on the contiguity planes between sectors and might or might not be localized in the polar angle [math] and/or azimuthal angle [math], implying a particle might remain confined to a relatively small neighborhood or meander over the sphere. The impact on motion trajectories and thus transport efficiency implies that the energy required to sustain a steady flow is starkly underestimated when symmetry is assumed for simplicity despite the presence of anisotropy.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Mean-field equations have been developed recently to approximate the dynamics of the Deffuant model of opinion formation. These equations can describe both fully mixed populations and the case where individuals interact only along edges of a network. In each case, interactions only occur between individuals whose opinions differ by less than a given parameter, called the confidence bound. The size of the confidence bound parameter is known to strongly affect both the dynamics and the number and location of opinion clusters. In this work, we carry out a mathematical analysis of the mean-field equations to investigate the role of the confidence bound and boundaries on these important observables of the model. We consider the limit in which the confidence bound interval is small, and we identify the key mechanisms driving opinion evolution. We show that linear stability analysis can predict the number and location of opinion clusters. Comparison with numerical simulations of the model illustrates that the early-time dynamics and the final cluster locations can be accurately approximated for networks composed of two degree classes, as well as for the case of a fully mixed population.]]></summary>

Structure-preserving algorithms and algorithms with uniform error bound have constituted two interesting classes of numerical methods. In this paper, we blend these two kinds of methods for solving nonlinear systems with highly oscillatory solution, and the blended algorithms inherit and respect the advantage of each method. Two kinds of algorithms are presented to preserve the symplecticity and energy of the Hamiltonian systems, respectively. Long time energy conservation is analysed for symplectic algorithms and the proposed algorithms are shown to have uniform error bound in the position for the highly oscillatory structure. Moreover, some methods with uniform error bound in the position and in the velocity are derived and analysed. Two numerical experiments are carried out to support all the theoretical results established in this paper by showing the performance of the blended algorithms.]]></summary>

In this paper, we construct an efficient spectral Galerkin method to deal with the classical second kind linear VIEs with weakly singular and highly oscillatory kernel. We first study the oscillation and singularity of the exact solution and then based on those results, we propose an efficient fully discrete spectral Galerkin method. The proposed algorithm reaches an optimal convergence order without the influence of the wave number. At last, two numerical examples are provided to verify the efficiency of our proposed method.]]></summary>

In this paper, we first propose and analyze a steady state Dual-Porosity-Navier–Stokes model, which describes both Dual-Porosity flow and free flow (governed by Navier–Stokes equation) coupled through four interface conditions, including the Beavers–Joseph interface condition. Then we propose a domain decomposition method for efficiently solving such a large complex system. Robin boundary conditions are used to decouple the Dual-Porosity equations from the Navier–Stokes equations in the coupled system. Based on the two decoupled sub-problems, a parallel Robin-Robin domain decomposition method is constructed and then discretized by finite elements. We analyze the convergence of the domain decomposition method with the finite element discretization and investigate the effect of Robin parameters on the convergence, which also provide instructions for how to choose the Robin parameters in practice. Three cases of Robin parameters are studied, including a difficult case which was not fully addressed in the literature, and the optimal geometric convergence rate is obtained. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the theoretical conclusions, illustrate how the theory can provide instructions on choosing Robin parameters, and show the features of the proposed model and domain decomposition method.]]></summary>

Contiguous submatrices of the Fourier matrix are known to be ill-conditioned. In a recent paper in SIAM review A. Barnett has provided new bounds on the rate of ill-conditioning (Barnett in SIAM Rev 64:105–131, 2022). In this paper we focus on the corresponding singular value decomposition. The singular vectors can be computed from the so-called periodic discrete prolate spheroidal sequences, named in analogy to spheroidal wave functions which are associated with the continuous Fourier transform. Their numerical computation is hampered by the clustering of singular values. We collect and expand known results on the stable numerical computation of the singular value decomposition of Fourier submatrices. The prolate sequences are eigenvectors of a tridiagonal matrix whose spectrum is free of clusters and this enables their computation. We collect these observations in a simple and convenient algorithm. The corresponding singular values can be accurately computed as well, except when they are small. Even then, small singular values can be computed in high-precision arithmetic with modest computational effort, even for large and extremely ill-conditioned submatrices. We illustrate the computations and point out a few applications in which Fourier submatrices arise.]]></summary>

Gaussian processes (GPs) are used for numerous different applications, including uncertainty quantification and optimization. Ill-conditioning of the covariance matrix for GPs is common with the use of various kernels, including the Gaussian, rational quadratic, and Matérn kernels. A common approach to overcome this problem is to add a nugget along the diagonal of the covariance matrix. For GPs that are not constructed with gradients, it is straightforward to derive a nugget value that guarantees the condition number of the covariance matrix to be below a user-set threshold. However, for gradient-enhanced GPs, there are no existing practical bounds to select a nugget that guarantee that the condition number of the gradient-enhanced covariance matrix is below a user-set threshold. In this paper a novel approach is taken to bound the condition number of the covariance matrix for GPs that use the Gaussian kernel. This is achieved by using non-isotropic rescaling for the data and a modest nugget value. This non-intrusive method works for GPs applied to problems of any dimension and it allows all data points to be kept. The method is applied to a Bayesian optimizer using a gradient-enhanced GP to achieve deep convergence. Without this method, the high condition number constrains the hyperparameters for the GP and this is shown to impede the convergence of the optimizer. It is also demonstrated that applying this method to the rational quadratic and Matérn kernels alleviates the ill-conditioning of their gradient-enhanced covariance matrices. Implementation of the method is straightforward and clearly described in the paper.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Online learning algorithms, widely used to power search and content optimization on the web, must balance exploration and exploitation, potentially sacrificing the experience of current users in order to gain information that will lead to better decisions in the future. While necessary in the worst case, explicit exploration has a number of disadvantages compared to the greedy algorithm that always “exploits” by choosing an action that currently looks optimal. We determine under what conditions inherent diversity in the data makes explicit exploration unnecessary. We build on a recent line of work on the smoothed analysis of the greedy algorithm in the linear contextual bandits model. We improve on prior results to show that the greedy algorithm almost matches the best possible Bayesian regret rate of any other algorithm on the same problem instance whenever the diversity conditions hold. The key technical finding is that data collected by the greedy algorithm suffices to simulate a run of any other algorithm. Further, we prove that under a particular smoothness assumption, the Bayesian regret of the greedy algorithm is at most [math] in the worst case, where [math] is the time horizon.]]></summary>

Isomanifolds are the generalization of isosurfaces to arbitrary dimension and codimension, i.e., submanifolds of [math] defined as the zero set of some multivariate multivalued smooth function [math], where [math] is the intrinsic dimension of the manifold. A natural way to approximate a smooth isomanifold [math] is to consider its piecewise linear (PL) approximation [math] based on a triangulation [math] of the ambient space [math]. In this paper, we describe a simple algorithm to trace isomanifolds from a given starting point. The algorithm works for arbitrary dimensions [math] and [math], and any precision [math]. Our main result is that, when [math] (or [math]) has bounded complexity, the complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in [math] and [math] (and unavoidably exponential in [math]). Since it is known that for [math], [math] is [math]-close and isotopic to [math], our algorithm produces a faithful PL-approximation of isomanifolds of bounded complexity in time polynomial in [math]. Combining this algorithm with dimensionality reduction techniques, the dependency on [math] in the size of [math] can be completely removed with high probability. We also show that the algorithm can handle isomanifolds with boundary and, more generally, isostratifolds. The algorithm for isomanifolds with boundary has been implemented and experimental results are reported, showing that it is practical and can handle cases that are far ahead of the state-of-the-art.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We consider the connectivity augmentation problem (CAP), a classical problem in the area of survivable network design. It is about increasing the edge-connectivity of a graph by one unit in the cheapest possible way. More precisely, given a [math]-edge-connected graph [math] and a set of extra edges, the task is to find a minimum cardinality subset of extra edges whose addition to [math] makes the graph [math]-edge-connected. If [math] is odd, the problem is known to reduce to the tree augmentation problem (TAP)—i.e., [math] is a spanning tree—for which significant progress has been achieved recently, leading to approximation factors below 1.5 (the current best factor is 1.458). However, advances on TAP have not carried over to CAP so …]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper investigates the inverse source problem with a single propagating mode at multiple frequencies in an acoustic waveguide. The goal is to provide both theoretical justification and efficient algorithms for imaging extended sources using the sampling methods. In contrast to the existing far/near-field operator based on the integral over the space variable in the sampling methods, a multi-frequency far-field operator is introduced based on the integral over the frequency variable. This far-field operator is defined in a way to incorporate the possibly nonlinear dispersion relation, a unique feature in waveguides. The factorization method is deployed to establish a rigorous characterization of the range support, which is the support of source in the direction of wave propagation. A related factorization-based sampling method is also discussed. These sampling methods are shown to be capable of imaging the range support of the source. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the sampling methods, including an example to image a complete sound-soft block.]]></summary>

In this study, we present a second-order time-accurate unconditionally stable numerical method for a gradient flow for the Modica–Mortola functional with an equispaced multiple well potential. The proposed second-order time-accurate unconditionally stable numerical method is based on the operator splitting method. The nonlinear and linear terms in the gradient flow are solved analytically and using the Fourier spectral method, respectively. The numerical solutions in each step are bounded for any time step size and the overall scheme is temporally second-order accurate. We prove theoretically the unconditional stability and boundedness of the numerical solutions. In addition, several numerical tests are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.]]></summary>

In this work, we consider the numerical solutions of a dispersion-managed nonlinear Schrödinger equation (DM-NLS) and a nonlinearity-managed NLS equation (NM-NLS). The two equations arise from the soliton managements in optics and matter waves, and they involve temporal discontinuous coefficients with possible frequent jumps and stiffness which cause numerical difficulties. We analyze to see the order reduction problems of some popular traditional methods, and then we propose a class of exponential-type dispersion-map integrators for both DM-NLS and NM-NLS. The proposed methods are explicit, efficient under Fourier pseudospectral discretizations and second order accurate in time regardless the jumps/jump-period in the dispersion map. The extension to the fast & strong management regime of DM-NLS is made with uniform accuracy.]]></summary>

We derive a fully-discrete finite element scheme to a fractional Timoshenko beam model, which characterizes the mechanical responses of viscoelastic beams, thick beams and beams subject to high-frequency excitations by properly considering the effects of both transverse shear and rotational inertia. We prove high-order regularity of the solutions to the model and then accordingly prove error estimates of the numerical scheme. Numerical experiments are performed to substantiate the numerical analysis results and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the fractional Timoshenko beam model in modeling the mechanical vibrations of different beams, in comparison with its integer-order analogue and the widely-used integer-order and fractional Euler-Bernoulli beam models.]]></summary>

We use trivariate spline functions for the numerical solution of the Dirichlet problem of the 3D elliptic Monge-Ampére equation. Mainly we use the spline collocation method introduced in [SIAM J. Numerical Analysis, 2405-2434,2022] to numerically solve iterative Poisson equations and use an averaged algorithm to ensure the convergence of the iterations. We shall also establish the rate of convergence under a sufficient condition and provide some numerical evidence to show the numerical rates. Then we present many computational results to demonstrate that this approach works very well. In particular, we tested many known convex solutions as well as nonconvex solutions over convex and nonconvex domains and compared them with several existing numerical methods to show the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
A novel approach for the stabilization of the discontinuous Galerkin method based on the Dafermos entropy rate crition is presented. The approach is centered around the efficient solution of linear or nonlinear optimization problems in every timestep as a correction to the basic discontinuous Galerkin scheme. The thereby enforced Dafermos criterion results in improved stability compared to the basic method while retaining a high order of accuracy in numerical experiments for scalar conservation laws. Further modification of the optimization problem allows also to enforce classical entropy inequalities for the scheme. The proposed stabilization is therefore an alternative to flux-differencing to enforce entropy inequalities. As the shock-capturing abilities of the scheme are also enhanced is the method also an alternative to finite-volume subcells, artificial viscosity, modal filtering, and other shock capturing procedures in one space dimension. Tests are carried out for Burgers’ equation.]]></summary>
