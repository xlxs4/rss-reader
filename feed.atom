 Abstract. We show the possibility of achieving nonreciprocal wave propagation in space-time modulated media and give an asymptotic analysis of the nonreciprocity property in terms of the amplitude of the time modulation. Such modulation causes a folding of the band structure of the material, which may induce degenerate points. By breaking time-reversal symmetry, we show that these degeneracies may open into nonsymmetric, unidirectional band gaps. Finally, we illustrate our results by several numerical simulations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Under the strong exponential-time hypothesis, the diameter of general unweighted graphs cannot be computed in truly subquadratic time (in the size [math] of the input), as shown by Roditty and Williams. Nevertheless there are several graph classes for which this can be done such as bounded-treewidth graphs, interval graphs, and planar graphs, to name a few. We propose to study unweighted graphs of constant distance Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC)-dimension as a broad generalization of many such classes—where the distance VC-dimension of a graph [math] is defined as the VC-dimension of its ball hypergraph whose hyperedges are the balls of all possible radii and centers in [math]. In particular for any fixed [m…]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper proposes a new general technique for maximal subgraph enumeration which we call proximity search, whose aim is to design efficient enumeration algorithms for problems that could not be solved by existing frameworks. To support this claim and illustrate the technique we include output-polynomial algorithms for several problems for which output-polynomial algorithms were not known, including the enumeration of maximal bipartite subgraphs, maximal [math]-degenerate subgraphs (for bounded [math]), maximal induced chordal subgraphs, and maximal induced trees. Using known techniques, such as reverse search, the space of all maximal solutions induces an implicit directed graph called “solution graph” or “supergraph,” and solutions are enumerated by traversing it; however, nodes in this graph can have exponential out-degree, thus requiring exponential time to be spent on each solution. The novelty of proximity search is a formalization that allows us to define a better solution graph, and a technique, which we call canonical reconstruction, by which we can exploit the properties of given problems to build such graphs. This results in solution graphs whose nodes have significantly smaller (i.e., polynomial) out-degree with respect to existing approaches, but that remain strongly connected, so that all solutions can be enumerated in polynomial delay by a traversal. A drawback of this approach is the space required to keep track of visited solutions, which can be exponential; we further propose a technique to induce a parent-child relationship among solutions and achieve polynomial space when suitable conditions are met.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the following problem: Given a continuous domain [math] along with its convex hull [math], a point [math], and a measure [math] on [math], find the probability density over [math] whose marginal is [math] and that minimizes the KL divergence to the uniform density with respect to [math]. Several distributions in mathematics, physics, statistics, and theoretical computer science arise by different settings of the parameters of this problem. We give a polynomial bound on the norm of the optimizer of the dual problem that holds in a very general setting and relies on a “balance” property of the measure [math] on [math], and exact algorithms for evaluating the dual and its gradient for several interesting settings of [math] and [math]. Together, along with the ellipsoid method, these results imply polynomial-time algorithms to compute such KL divergence minimizing distributions in several cases. Applications of our results include (1) an optimization characterization of the Goemans–Williamson measure [M. X. Goemans and D. P. Williamson, J ACM, 42 (1995), pp. 1115–1145] that is used to round a positive semidefinite matrix to a vector; (2) the computability of the entropic barrier for convex bodies, given a strong integration oracle, studied by [S. Bubeck and R. Eldan, Proc. Mach. Learn. Res. (PMLR), 40 (2015), p. 279], and (3) a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the barycentric quantum entropy of a density matrix that was proposed as an alternative to von Neumann entropy [W. Band and J. L. Park, Found. Phys., 6 (1976), pp. 249–262; J. L. Park and W. Band, Found. Phys., 7 (1977), pp. 233–244; P. B. Slater, Phys. Lett. A, 159 (1991), pp. 411–414]; this corresponds to the case when [math] is the set of rank-one projection matrices and [math] is derived from the Haar measure on the unit sphere.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper considers Bayesian revenue maximization in the [math]-unit setting, where a monopolist seller has [math] copies of an indivisible item and faces [math] unit-demand buyers (whose value distributions can be nonidentical). Four basic mechanisms among others have been widely employed in practice and widely studied in the literature: Myerson auction, sequential posted-pricing, [math]-th price auction with anonymous reserve, and anonymous pricing. Regarding a pair of mechanisms, we investigate the largest possible ratio between the two revenues (also known as the revenue gap), over all possible value distributions of the buyers. Divide these four mechanisms into two groups: (i) the discriminating mechanism group, Myerson auction and sequential posted-pricing, and (ii) the anonymous mechanism group, anonymous reserve and anonymous pricing. Within one group, the involved two mechanisms have an asymptotically tight revenue gap of [math]. In contrast, any two mechanisms from the different groups have an asymptotically tight revenue gap of [math].]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Condensed coacervate phases are now understood to be important features of modern cell biology, as well as valuable protocellular models in origin of life studies and synthetic biology. In each of these fields, the development of model systems with varied and tuneable material properties is of great importance for replicating properties of life. Here, we develop a ligase ribozyme system capable of concatenating short RNA fragments into extremely long chains. Our results show that formation of coacervate microdroplets with the ligase ribozyme and poly(L-lysine) enhances ribozyme rate and yield, which in turn increases the length of the anionic polymer component of the system and imparts specific physical properties to the droplets. Droplets containing active ribozyme sequences resist growth, do not wet or spread on unpassivated surfaces, and exhibit reduced transfer of RNA between droplets when compared to controls containing inactive sequences. These altered behaviours, which stem from RNA sequence and catalytic activity, constitute a specific phenotype and potential fitness advantage, opening the door to selection and evolution experiments based on a genotype - phenotype linkage.]]></summary>

We consider globally connected coupled Winfree oscillators under the influence of an external periodic forcing. Such systems exhibit many qualitatively different regimes of collective dynamics. Our aim is to understand this collective dynamics and, in particular, the system’s capability of entrainment to the external forcing. To quantify the entrainment of the system, we introduce the entrainment degree, that is, the proportion of oscillators that synchronize to the forcing, as the main focus of this paper. Through a series of numerical simulations, we study the entrainment degree for different inter-oscillator coupling strengths, external forcing strengths, and distributions of natural frequencies of the Winfree oscillators, and we compare the results for the different cases. In the case of identical oscillators, we give a precise description of the parameter regions where oscillators are entrained. Finally, we use a mean-field method, based on the Ott–Antonsen ansatz, to obtain a low-dimensional description of the collective dynamics and to compute an approximation of the entrainment degree. The mean-field results turn out to be strikingly similar to the results obtained through numerical simulations of the full system dynamics.]]></summary>

The persistence of biodiversity of species is a challenging proposition in ecological communities in the face of Darwinian selection. The present article investigates beyond the pairwise competitive interactions and provides a novel perspective for understanding the influence of higher-order interactions on the evolution of social phenotypes. Our simple model yields a prosperous outlook to demonstrate the impact of perturbations on intransitive competitive higher-order interactions. Using a mathematical technique, we show how alone the perturbed interaction network can quickly determine the coexistence equilibrium of competing species instead of solving a large system of ordinary differential equations. It is possible to split the system into multiple feasible cluster states depending on the number of perturbations. Our analysis also reveals that the ratio between the unperturbed and perturbed species is inversely proportional to the amount of employed perturbation. Our results suggest that nonlinear dynamical systems and interaction topologies can be interplayed to comprehend species’ coexistence under adverse conditions. Particularly, our findings signify that less competition between two species increases their abundance and outperforms others.]]></summary>

Vibro-impact phenomena in engineering systems, considered an adverse effect in some settings, are an intrinsic part of the mechanism in others. In energy harvesting, a vibro-impact component is often intentionally introduced to increase the power output or the system’s bandwidth. The impacts can be treated as “hard” for instantaneous impacts or “soft” for compliant materials. Since both types of models exhibit complex dynamics, a comparison is non-trivial. We develop a soft impact model for a vibro-impact energy harvester, calibrating it with the relevant hard impact model for large stiffness, and systematically compare the different phenomena and dynamics in various compliant regimes. Numerical results are used in two different parametric analyses, considering the bifurcation diagrams in terms of device size and external forcing parameters. Varying the natural frequency of the membranes that form the impact boundaries, we observe shifts in the bifurcation structure that promote period-1 orbits for increased softness parameters, often generating higher power output, but also introducing parameter sensitivities for increased softness. Complementary analytical results reveal unstable periodic orbits and co-existing behaviors, potentially missed by computational methods, that can influence the bifurcation structure and in turn the energy output. A non-dimensional formulation highlights the significance of ratios of external and natural frequencies in delineating soft and hard impact scenarios parametrically. The soft impact model exhibits new symmetry breaking bifurcations related to key quantities that characterize the soft impact dynamics, such as the effective restitution coefficients, the impact phase, and the contact time interval, not captured by hard impact models.]]></summary>

Building on a pre-existing line of inquiry where the presence of solid particle attractors in thermovibrationally driven flows was demonstrated in cavities subjected to a unidirectional temperature gradient, the present work considers cases where the direction of such a gradient is allowed to change inside the fluid. Moreover, the considered configurations differ with regard to the angle that vibrations form with respect to a reference axis. Variations in the orientation of the temperature gradient are made possible by setting a non-uniform temperature distribution along certain walls. The relationship between the multiplicity (N) of the loci of particle attraction and the inhomogeneities in the temperature field is studied. It is shown that N can exceed the limit N = 2 found in earlier studies and that a zoo of new particle accumulation structures show up, whose ranges of existence depend on the amplitude and frequency of vibrational acceleration, the particle Stokes number, the orientation of vibrations, and the number of inversions in the direction of the temperature gradient.]]></summary>

We report the emergence of peculiar chimera states in networks of identical pendula with global phase-lagged coupling. The states reported include both rotating and quiescent modes, i.e., with non-zero and zero average frequencies. This kind of mixed-mode chimeras may be interpreted as images of bump states known in neuroscience in the context of modeling the working memory. We illustrate this striking phenomenon for a network of [math] coupled pendula, followed by a detailed description of the minimal non-trivial case of [math]. Parameter regions for five characteristic types of the system behavior are identified, which consist of two mixed-mode chimeras with one and two rotating pendula, classical weak chimera with all three pendula rotating, synchronous rotation, and quiescent state. The network dynamics is multistable: up to four of the states can coexist in the system phase state as demonstrated through the basins of attraction. The analysis suggests that the robust mixed-mode chimera states can generically describe the complex dynamics of diverse pendula-like systems widespread in nature.]]></summary>

In this paper, the complex dynamics of non-smooth Hindmarsh–Rose (HR) neuron system with local active memristors is discussed through the theory of discontinuous dynamical system. Six mapping structures through two boundaries are employed to illustrate the various switching behaviors of the system. The analytical conditions of the HR system for the switching motions, such as passable motion and grazing motion, are investigated, and the extreme multistability of the improved HR neuron is revealed through switching bifurcations, parameter maps, and attraction basins. The firing activities of various modes in the HR system and the coexistence of various firing behaviors are observed by changing the initial values. Furthermore, the hardware circuit implement of the HR system is established to validate the numerical results.]]></summary>

For instance, the work of Touboul and Destexhe demonstrated that non-critical systems could also display such scale-free dynamics, which passed their rigorous statistical analyses. In this paper, we show that a fully connected stochastic neural network may also generate scale-free dynamics simply by jumping among many stable states.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We introduce an end-to-end deep learning architecture called the wide-band butterfly network (WideBNet) for approximating the inverse scattering map from wide-band scattering data. This architecture incorporates tools from computational harmonic analysis, such as the butterfly factorization, and traditional multi-scale methods, such as the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm, to drastically reduce the number of trainable parameters to match the inherent complexity of the problem. As a result, WideBNet is efficient: it requires fewer training points than off-the-shelf architectures and has stable training dynamics which are compatible with standard weight initialization strategies. The architecture automatically adapts to the dimensions of the data with only a few hyper-parameters that the user must specify. WideBNet is able to produce images that are competitive with optimization-based approaches, but at a fraction of the cost, and we also demonstrate numerically that it learns to super-resolve scatterers with a full aperture configuration.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we consider the classical wave equation with time-dependent, spatially multiscale coefficients. We propose a fully discrete computational multiscale method in the spirit of the localized orthogonal decomposition in space with a backward Euler scheme in time. We show optimal convergence rates in space and time beyond the assumptions of spatial periodicity or scale separation of the coefficients. Further, we propose an adaptive update strategy for the time-dependent multiscale basis. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results and showcase the practicability of the adaptive update strategy.]]></summary>

With T7 exonuclease, PAM-less detection could be achieved with a low concentration of cas12a, costing $0.8 USD per reaction.

Adaptive spectral (AS) decompositions associated with a piecewise constant function, u, yield small subspaces where the characteristic functions comprising u are well approximated.

The elastic transmission eigenvalue problem, arising from the inverse scattering theory, plays a critical role in the qualitative reconstruction methods for elastic media.

The log-sum penalty is often adopted as a replacement for the 
                      
                      \(\ell _0\)
                      
                     pseudo-norm in compressive sensing and low-rank optimization. The proximity operator of the 
                      
                      \(\ell _0\)
                      
                     penalty, i.e., the hard-thresholding operator, plays an essential role in applications; similarly, we require an efficient method for evaluating the proximity operator of the log-sum penalty. Due to the nonconvexity of this function, its proximity operator is commonly computed through the iteratively reweighted 
                      
                      \(\ell _1\)
                      
                     method, which replaces the log-sum term with its first-order approximation. This paper reports that the proximity operator of the log-sum penalty actually has an explicit expression. With it, we show that the iteratively reweighted 
                      
                      \(\ell _1\)
                      
                     solution disagrees with the true proximity operator in certain regions. As a by-product, the iteratively reweighted 
                      
                      \(\ell _1\)
                      
                     solution is precisely characterized in terms of the chosen initialization. We also give the explicit form of the proximity operator for the composition of the log-sum penalty with the singular value function, as seen in low-rank applications. These results should be useful in the development of efficient and accurate algorithms for optimization problems involving the log-sum penalty. We present applications to solving compressive sensing problems and to mixed additive Gaussian white noise and impulse noise removal.]]></summary>

This paper aims to study amplitude death in time delay coupled oscillators using the occasional coupling scheme that implies intermittent interaction among the oscillators. An enhancement of amplitude death regions (i.e., an increment of the width of the amplitude death regions along the control parameter axis) can be possible using the occasional coupling in a pair of delay-coupled oscillators. Our study starts with coupled limit cycle oscillators (Stuart–Landau) and coupled chaotic oscillators (Rössler). We further examine coupled horizontal Rijke tubes, a prototypical model of thermoacoustic systems. Oscillatory states are highly detrimental to thermoacoustic systems such as combustors. Consequently, a state of amplitude death is always preferred. We employ the on–off coupling (i.e., a square wave function), as an occasional coupling scheme, to these coupled oscillators. On monotonically varying the coupling strength (as a control parameter), we observe an enhancement of amplitude death regions using the occasional coupling scheme compared to the continuous coupling scheme. In order to study the contribution of the occasional coupling scheme, we perform a detailed linear stability analysis and analytically explain this enhancement of the amplitude death region for coupled limit cycle oscillators. We also adopt the frequency ratio of the oscillators and the time delay between the oscillators as the control parameters. Intriguingly, we obtain a similar enhancement of the amplitude death regions using the frequency ratio and time delay as the control parameters in the presence of the occasional coupling. Finally, we use a half-wave rectified sinusoidal wave function (motivated by practical reality) to introduce the occasional coupling in time delay coupled oscillators and get similar results.]]></summary>

Herein we made a parallel comparison between the recently reported miniature Cas12f1 and the widely used Cas12a and Cas9 nucleases in mammalian cells. The results revealed that as a CRISPRa activator, Un1Cas12f1 could induce gene expression with a comparable level to these of Cas12a and Cas9, while as a cleaving editor, Cas12f1 exhibited similar properties to Cas12a, like high specificity and dominantly induced deletions over insertions, but with less activity. In contrast, wild-type SpCas9 showed the highest activity, lowest specificity, and induced balanced deletions over insertions. Thus, Cas12f1 is recommended for gene-activation-based applications, Cas12a is for therapy applications, and wild-type Cas9 is for in vitro and animal investigations. The comparison provided the editing properties of current widely used DNA-targeting CRISPR systems for the gene-editing field.]]></summary>

In this paper, we propose an efficient proper orthogonal decomposition based reduced-order model (POD-ROM) for nonstationary Stokes equations, which combines the classical projection method with POD technique. This new scheme mainly owns two advantages: the first one is low computational costs since the classical projection method decouples the reduced-order velocity variable and reduced-order pressure variable, and POD technique further improves the computational efficiency; the second advantage consists of circumventing the verification of classical LBB/inf-sup condition for mixed reduced spaces with the help of pressure stabilized Petrov–Galerkin (PSPG)-type projection method, where the pressure stabilization term is inherent which allows the use of non inf-sup stable elements without adding extra stabilization terms. We analyze the proposed projection POD-ROM’s stability and convergence, and numerical experiments validate those theoretical results and also the high-efficiency.]]></summary>

Here, we replace the native  energy-inefficient Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle in Cupriavidus necator by genomic integration of the synthetic reductive glycine pathway for growth on formate. Our final engineered strain reaches a higher biomass yield than the CBB-cycle-utilizing wild type, showing for the first time that efficiencies found in natural metabolism can be exceeded via a synthetic pathway. This yield increase demonstrates the potential of synthetic metabolism and is an important step towards realizing truly sustainable, economically feasible bio-based production.]]></summary>

Simplified conditions are given for the existence and positivity of wave speed for an integro-difference equation with a strong Allee effect and an unbounded habitat.

It is shown that if the wave speed is positive there exists a critical patch size such that for a habitat size above the critical patch size solutions can persist in space, and if the wave speed is negative solutions always approach zero. An analytical integral formula is developed to determine the critical patch size when the Laplace dispersal kernel is used, and this formula shows existence of multiple equilibrium solutions.

Atherosclerosis, one of the leading causes of death in USA and worldwide, begins with a lesion in the intima of the arterial wall, allowing LDL to penetrate into the intima where they are oxidized. The immune system considers these oxidized LDL as a dangerous substance and tasks the macrophages to attack them; incapacitated macrophages become foam cells and leads to the formation of a plaque. As the plaque continues to grow, it progressively restricts the blood flow, possibly triggering heart attack or stroke. Because the blood vessels tend to be circular, two-space dimensional cross section model is a good approximation, and the two-space dimensional models are studied in Friedman et al. (J Differ Equ 259(4):1227–1255, 2015) and Zhao and Hu (J Differ Equ 288:250–287, 2021). It is interesting to see whether a true three-space dimensional stationary solution can be developed. We shall establish a three-space dimensional stationary solution for the mathematical model of the initiation and development of atherosclerosis which involves LDL and HDL cholesterols, macrophages and foam cells. The model is a highly nonlinear and coupled system of PDEs with a free boundary, the interface between the plaque and the blood flow. We establish infinite branches of symmetry-breaking stationary solutions which bifurcate from the annular stationary solution in the longitude direction.]]></summary>

A three-layer prey–predator model with two time-delays and one delay-dependent parameter is established in this paper. To begin, the paper calculates the conditions for each population in the model to maintain the quantity stable and Hopf bifurcation when [math], [math], [math] is in the stable interval, and [math]. The crossing curves, their type, and the direction of the crossing curves are then obtained using the crossing curve method, which is composed of the threshold values of the dynamic behavior change on the two time-delays plane when [math]. The real data from the forage grass–Ochotona curzoniae–Buteo hemilasius food chain is used to conduct an empirical study of the model. When [math], the feasible region of the crossing curves is open-ended, and the model's crossing curves on the [math] plane are truncated. This indicates that the model's threshold distribution of dynamic behavior change is a regular curve made of several curves. The simulation using the time-delay value on the crossing curves shows that the model produces different dynamic behaviors such as stability, bifurcation, and chaos depending on the time-delay value on both sides of the curves. The critical values of dynamic behavior change are time-delay values on the crossing curves. The empirical study shows that increasing Ochotona curzoniae’s environmental capacity can easily cause Hopf bifurcation of the system. At this time, the number of each population in the Plateau ecosystem constantly fluctuates, and Ochotona curzoniae is vulnerable to extinction.]]></summary>

In the field of complex dynamics, multistable attractors have been gaining significant attention due to their unpredictability in occurrence and extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Co-existing attractors are abundant in diverse systems ranging from climate to finance and ecological to social systems. In this article, we investigate a data-driven approach to infer different dynamics of a multistable system using an echo state network. We start with a parameter-aware reservoir and predict diverse dynamics for different parameter values. Interestingly, a machine is able to reproduce the dynamics almost perfectly even at distant parameters, which lie considerably far from the parameter values related to the training dynamics. In continuation, we can predict whole bifurcation diagram significant accuracy as well. We extend this study for exploring various dynamics of multistable attractors at an unknown parameter value. While we train the machine with the dynamics of only one attractor at parameter [math], it can capture the dynamics of a co-existing attractor at a new parameter value [math]. Continuing the simulation for a multiple set of initial conditions, we can identify the basins for different attractors. We generalize the results by applying the scheme on two distinct multistable systems.]]></summary>

On average once every four years, the Tropical Pacific warms considerably during events called El Niño, leading to weather disruptions over many regions on Earth. Recent machine-learning approaches to El Niño prediction, in particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown a surprisingly high skill at relatively long lead times. In an attempt to understand this high skill, we here use data from distorted physics simulations with the intermediate-complexity Zebiak–Cane model to determine what aspects of El Niño physics are represented in a specific CNN-based classification method.

Game theory is now routinely applied to quantitatively model the decision making of individuals presented with various voluntary actions that can prevent a given disease. Most models consider only a single preventive strategy and the case where multiple preventative actions are available is severely understudied. In our paper, we consider a very simple SI compartmental model of rabies in the domestic dog population. We study two choices of the dog owners: to vaccinate their dogs or to restrict the movements of unvaccinated dogs. We analyze the relatively rich patterns of Nash equilibria (NE). We show that there is always at least one NE at which the owners utilize only one form of prevention. However, there can be up to three different NEs at the same time: two NEs at which the owners use exclusively only the vaccination or movement restriction, and the third NE when the owners use both forms of prevention simultaneously. However, we also show that, unlike the first two types of NEs, the third kind of NE is not convergent stable.]]></summary>

Deriving emergent patterns from models of biological processes is a core concern of mathematical biology. In the context of partial differential equations, these emergent patterns sometimes appear as local minimisers of a corresponding energy functional. Here we give methods for determining the qualitative structure of local minimum energy states of a broad class of multi-species nonlocal advection–diffusion models, recently proposed for modelling the spatial structure of ecosystems. We show that when each pair of species respond to one another in a symmetric fashion (i.e. via mutual avoidance or mutual attraction, with equal strength), the system admits an energy functional that decreases in time and is bounded below. This suggests that the system will eventually reach a local minimum energy steady state, rather than fluctuating in perpetuity. We leverage this energy functional to develop tools, including a novel application of computational algebraic geometry, for making conjectures about the number and qualitative structure of local minimum energy solutions. These conjectures give a guide as to where to look for numerical steady state solutions, which we verify through numerical analysis. Our technique shows that even with two species, multi-stability with up to four classes of local minimum energy states can emerge. The associated dynamics include spatial sorting via aggregation and repulsion both within and between species. The emerging spatial patterns include a mixture of territory-like segregation as well as narrow spike-type solutions. Overall, our study reveals a general picture of rich multi-stability in systems of moving and interacting species.]]></summary>

In this paper, we present a novel tensor completion model which combines the Laplace function and an anisotropic total variation regularization. The Laplace function is utilized to approximate the tensor multi-rank, and the total variation regularization is added to improve the local piecewise smoothness and preserve the edges of the restored tensor data. An efficient alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed to tackle the tensor completion model, and its convergence theorem is also derived. Extensive experimental results on color images, videos, multispectral images and magnetic resonance imaging data show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) has become an important methodology in applied mathematics for reducing the computational cost of weak approximations. For many problems, it is well-known that strong pairwise coupling of numerical solutions in the multilevel hierarchy is needed to obtain efficiency gains. In this work, we show that strong pairwise coupling indeed is also important when MLMC is applied to stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) of reaction-diffusion type, as it can improve the rate of convergence and thus improve tractability. For the MLMC method with strong pairwise coupling that was developed and studied numerically on filtering problems in (Chernov in Num Math 147:71-125, 2021), we prove that the rate of computational efficiency is higher than for existing methods. We also provide numerical comparisons with alternative coupling ideas on linear and nonlinear SPDE to illustrate the importance of this feature.]]></summary>

Of paramount importance in both ecological systems and economic policies are the problems of harvesting of natural resources. A paradigmatic situation where this question is raised is that of fishing strategies. Indeed, overfishing is a well-known problem in the management of live-stocks, as being too greedy may lead to an overall dramatic depletion of the population we are harvesting. A closely related topic is that of Nash equilibria in the context of fishing policies. Namely, two players being in competition for the same pool of resources, is it possible for them to find an equilibrium situation? The goal of this paper is to provide a detailed analysis of these two queries (i.e optimal fishing strategies for single-player models and study of Nash equilibria for multiple players…]]></summary>

This paper presents a multirate in time approach for coupled flow and transport problems combined with goal-oriented error control based on the Dual Weighted Residual (DWR) method. The focus is on the implementation of the multirate concept regarding different time scales for the underlying subproblems. Key ingredients are an arbitrary degree discontinuous Galerkin time discretization, an a posteriori error representation for the transport problem coupled with flow and the concept of space-time slabs based on tensor-product spaces. From the latter, a space-time mesh adaptation with highly economical grids is developed. The performance of the approach is studied carefully by numerical convergence examples as well as an example of physical interest for convection-dominated transport.]]></summary>

In this research, a radial basis functions weighted essentially non-oscillatory (RBF-WENO) scheme in the framework of finite difference is developed for solving non-linear degenerate parabolic (NDP) equations which may contain discontinuous solutions. The traditional WENO schemes for solving NDP equations are based on the polynomial interpolation. In this paper, a non-polynomial WENO finite difference scheme in order to enhance the local accuracy is proposed. For a non-polynomial interpolation basis, the infinitely smooth RBFs such as the multi-quadratic are adopted. By optimizing the free parameter in RBFs, the local error generated by the RBFs interpolation can be easily controlled. The formulation of scheme will be described in detail and numerical tests have been prepared to demonstrate the efficiency of the scheme in one and two-dimension. The numerical results demonstrate that the developed non-polynomial WENO schemes enhance the local accuracy and give sharper solution profile than the original WENO based on the polynomial interpolation for solving NDP equations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the solution landscape and bifurcation diagrams of nematic liquid crystals confined on a rectangle, using a reduced two-dimensional Landau–de Gennes framework in terms of two geometry-dependent variables: half short edge length [math] and aspect ratio [math]. First, we analytically prove that, for any [math] with a small enough [math] or for a large enough [math] with a fixed domain size, there is a unique stable solution that has two line defects on the opposite short edges. Second, we numerically construct solution landscapes by varying [math] and [math], and report a novel X state, which emerges from saddle-node bifurcation and serves as the parent state in such a solution landscape. Various new classes are then found among these solution landscapes, including the X class, the S class, and the L class. By tracking the Morse indices of individual solutions, we present bifurcation diagrams for nematic equilibria, thus illustrating the emergence mechanism of critical points and several effects of geometrical anisotropy on confined defect patterns.]]></summary>

We prove that there exist two types of standing waves: standing front waves and unimodal waves, if the line segment is long enough. We also numerically show the exact number of standing wave solutions for a cubic nonlinearity and for a piecewise linear case. The stability and instability of the standing wave solutions are also investigated. Standing waves play a role in blocking the front propagation.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Pattern formation arising from the reaction-diffusion epidemic model is a space-time depiction of the distribution and transmission of infectious diseases. Disease control can be achieved by controlling the associated pattern formations. For an SIR reaction-diffusion epidemic model, we review its Turing pattern formations with different transmission rates under the case of a constant recovery rate. To control pattern formations of the SIR epidemic model, we introduce a regulator as a control function of the recovery rate. For a perfect control strategy, it not only leads to a desired pattern formation, but also has a small support in space-time domains. In order to obtain such a control strategy, we propose a sparse optimal control problem governed by the SIR epidemic model. We study the existence of optimal solutions, derive the first order necessary optimality system, obtain the sparsity structure of the control function, and numerically solve the control problem. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectivity of our method.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In mathematical modeling, it is common to have an equation [math], where the exact form of [math] is not known. This article shows that there are large classes of [math] where almost all [math] share the same properties. The classes we investigate are vector spaces [math] of [math] functions [math] that satisfy the following condition: [math] has “almost constant rank" (ACR) if there is a constant integer [math] such that rank[math] for “almost every" [math] and almost every [math]. If the vector space [math] is finite dimensional, then “almost every" is with respect to the Lebesgue measure on [math], and otherwise, it means almost every in the sense of prevalence, as described herein. Most function spaces commonly used for modeling purposes are ACR. In particular, we show that if all of the functions in [math] are linear or polynomial or real analytic, or if [math] is the set of all functions in a “structured system", then [math] is ACR. For each [math] and [math], the solution set of [math] is SolSet[math]. A solution set of [math] is called robust if it persists despite small changes in [math] and [math]. The following two global results are proved for almost every [math] in an ACR vector space [math]: (1) Either the solution set SolSet[math] is robust for almost every [math], or none of the solution sets are robust. (2) The solution set SolSet[math] is a [math]-manifold of dimension [math]. In particular, [math] is the same for almost every [math].]]></summary>

However, sulfide-dependent THI4s are anaerobic or microoxic enzymes and hence unadapted to the aerobic conditions in plants; they are also slow enzymes (kcat <1 h-1). To improve aerotolerance and activity, we applied continuous directed evolution under aerobic conditions in the yeast OrthoRep system to two sulfide-dependent bacterial THI4s. Six beneficial single mutations were identified, of which five lie in the active-site cleft predicted by structural modeling and two recapitulate features of naturally aerotolerant THI4s. That single mutations gave substantial improvements suggests that further advance under selection will be possible by stacking mutations. This proof-of-concept study established that the performance of sulfide-dependent THI4s in aerobic conditions is evolvable and, more generally, that yeast OrthoRep provides a plant-like bridge to adapt nonplant enzymes to work better in plants.]]></summary>

To understand the mechanisms underlying species coexistence, ecologists often study invasion growth rates of theoretical and data-driven models. These growth rates correspond to average per-capita growth rates of one species with respect to an ergodic measure supporting other species. In the ecological literature, coexistence often is equated with the invasion growth rates being positive. Intuitively, positive invasion growth rates ensure that species recover from being rare. To provide a mathematically rigorous framework for this approach, we prove theorems that answer two questions: (i) When do the signs of the invasion growth rates determine coexistence? (ii) When signs are sufficient, which invasion growth rates need to be positive? We focus on deterministic models and equate …]]></summary>

This article aims to compare the long-term behavior of a spread model before and after a type in the model becomes frozen, namely, a type of which an individual only produces individuals of the same type. By means of substitution dynamical systems and matrix analysis, the first result of this work gives the spread rates of a 1-spread model with one frozen symbol. Later, in the work, this is shown to hold under more general settings, which include generalized frozen symbols and frozen symbols in [math]-spread models. Numerical experiments are provided as supporting evidence for the theory.]]></summary>

We study the synchronization of two coupled idealized economies. In the present work, we consider a recently developed economic system that shows a richness of dynamical behavior. By means of the Lyapunov exponents, we analyze that there is overly complex behavior in the transitions in the dynamics of an isolated economy, oscillating between chaotic attractors and limit cycles. Then, for two coupled economies, we analyze the synchronization states for the space of all control parameters as a function of the network coupling parameter. Interestingly, we have evidenced that there is a broad region of fully synchronized states and as we increase the coupling, some phenomena such as a smooth and intermittent loss in synchronization emerge. In the same way, we observe phase synchronization for one of the control parameters. Ultimately, in order to confirm this loss of synchronization, we inspect the stability of synchronized states through the master stability function method for some control parameters. Here, we corroborate what was previously observed, the unexpected vast range of control parameter values of instability corresponding to desynchronization.]]></summary>

Here, we report the development of a method, termed SLICER, which can be used to create seamless genome modifications in D. radiodurans. We used SLICER to sequentially target four putative restriction-modification (R-M) system genes, recycling the same selective and screening markers for each subsequent deletion. A fifth R-M gene was replaced by a selectable marker to create a final D. radiodurans strain with 5 of the 6 putative R-M systems deleted. While we observed no significant increase in transformation efficiency, SLICER is a promising method to obtain a fully restriction-minus strain and expand the synthetic biology applications of D. radiodurans including as an in vivo DNA assembly platform.

These sensors constitute a genetic circuit comprising a sensing module and an output module, such that a detectable signal is produced in the presence of the desired analyte. The MerR family of metal-responsive regulators offers great potential for the construction of metal sensing circuits, due to their high sensitivity, tight transcription control and large diversity in metal-specificity. However, the sensing diversity is broadest in Gram-negative systems, while chassis organisms are often selected from Gram-positive species, particularly sporulating bacilli. This can be problematic, because Gram-negative biological parts, such as promoters, are frequently observed to be non-functional in Gram-positive hosts. Herein, we combined construction of synthetic genetic circuits and chimeric MerR regulators, supported by structure-guided design, to generate metal-sensitive biosensor modules that are functional in the biotechnological work-horse species Bacillus subtilis. These chimeras consist of a constant Gram-positive derived DNA-binding domain fused to variable metal binding domains of Gram-negative origins. To improve the specificity of the whole-cell biosensor, we developed a modular  AND gate logic system based on the B. subtilis natively split {sigma}-factor, SigO-RsoA, designed to maximise future use for synthetic biology applications in B. subtilis. This work provides insights into the use of modular regulators, such as the MerR family, in the design of synthetic circuits for the detection of heavy metals, with potential wider applicability of the approach to other systems and genetic backgrounds.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Absolute Concentration Robustness (ACR) was introduced by Shinar and Feinberg (Science 327:1389-1391, 2010) as robustness of equilibrium species concentration in a mass action dynamical system. Their aim was to devise a mathematical condition that will ensure robustness in the function of the biological system being modeled. The robustness of function rests on what we refer to as empirical robustness—the concentration of a species remains unvarying, when measured in the long run, across arbitrary initial conditions. Even simple examples show that the ACR notion introduced in Shinar and Feinberg (Science 327:1389-1391, 2010) (here referred to as static ACR) is neither necessary nor sufficient for empirical robustness. To make a stronger connection with empirical robustness, we define dynamic ACR, a property related to long-term, global dynamics, rather than only to equilibrium behavior. We discuss general dynamical systems with dynamic ACR properties as well as parametrized families of dynamical systems related to reaction networks. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for dynamic ACR in complex balanced reaction networks, a class of networks that is central to the theory of reaction networks.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A matrix basis formulation is introduced to represent the [math] frequency domain dyadic Green’s functions of Maxwell’s equations in 3-dimensional layered media. The formulation can be used to decompose the Maxwell’s Green’s functions into independent TE and TM components, each satisfying a scalar Helmholtz equation. Moreover, the interface transmission conditions for the electromagnetic fields can be reduced to decoupled conditions for the matrix basis coefficients at interfaces. Numerical results for the electric and magnetic dyadic Green’s functions for a 10-layer medium show the capability of the proposed formulation.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we formulate susceptible-infected-susceptible reaction-diffusion epidemic models with cognition and show the impact of movement strategies on disease outbreak and mitigation under a spatially heterogeneous environment. The cognitive diffusion either takes a Fokker–Planck type diffusion obtained by Chapman’s diffusion law (called random diffusion) or follows Fick’s diffusion law (called symmetric diffusion). We derive a variational expression of the basic reproduction number [math] for both models and prove that the disease-free equilibrium is unique and globally asymptotically stable if [math]. Furthermore, if [math], the model following Fick’s diffusion law admits at least one endemic equilibrium and the model following Chapman’s diffusion law has a unique endemic equilibrium. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations, which additionally show the segregation phenomenon between susceptible and infected populations regulated by different movement strategies. Spatial segregation here is natural, not caused by an isolation policy, and thus is the most important indicator for an infectious disease to spread or wane in the absence of intervention. The first example shows that a heterogeneous random diffusion segregates infected and susceptible populations further than an ODE model and thus reduces the infection size. However, symmetric diffusion never does that. The second example shows that a heterogeneous random diffusion detriments segregation but still reduces the infection severity by moving infected individuals to a disease-free region. In a certain situation, a heterogeneous random diffusion may increase the infection severity as shown in the last example.]]></summary>

We report on collective excitable events in a highly diluted random network of non-excitable nodes. Excitability arises thanks to a self-sustained local adaptation mechanism that drives the system on a slow timescale across a hysteretic phase transition involving states with different degrees of synchronization. These phenomena have been investigated for the Kuramoto model with bimodal distribution of the natural frequencies and for the Kuramoto model with inertia and a unimodal frequency distribution. We consider global and partial stimulation protocols and characterize the system response for different levels of dilution. We compare the results with those obtained in the fully coupled case showing that such collective phenomena are remarkably robust against network diluteness.]]></summary>

We presented a methodology to approximate the entropy production for Brownian motion in a tilted periodic potential. The approximation stems from the well known thermodynamic uncertainty relation. By applying a virial-like expansion, we provided a tighter lower limit solely in terms of the drift velocity and diffusion. The approach presented is systematically analyzed in the tight-binding regime. We also provide a relative simple rule to validate using the tight-binding approach based on drift and diffusion relations rather than energy barriers and forces.

The interaction between the swarm individuals affects the dynamic behavior of the swarm, but it is difficult to obtain directly from outside observation. Therefore, the problem we focus on is inferring the structure of the interactions in the swarm from the individual behavior trajectories. Similar inference problems that existed in network science are named network reconstruction or network inference. It is a fundamental problem pervading research on complex systems. In this paper, a new method, called Motion Trajectory Similarity, is developed for inferring direct interactions from the motion state of individuals in the swarm. It constructs correlations by combining the similarity of the motion trajectories of each cross section of the time series, in which individuals with highly similar motion states are more likely to interact with each other. Experiments on the flocking systems demonstrate that our method can produce a reliable interaction inference and outperform traditional network inference methods. It can withstand a high level of noise and time delay introduced into flocking models, as well as parameter variation in the flocking system, to achieve robust reconstruction. The proposed method provides a new perspective for inferring the interaction structure of a swarm, which helps us to explore the mechanisms of collective movement in swarms and paves the way for developing the flocking models that can be quantified and predicted.]]></summary>

Synchronous collisions between a large number of solitons are considered in the context of a statistical description. It is shown that, during the interaction of solitons of the same signs, the wave field is effectively smoothed out. When the number of solitons increases and the sequence of their amplitudes decay slower, the focused wave becomes even smoother and the statistical moments get frozen for a long time. This quasi-stationary state is characterized by greatly reduced statistical moments and by the density of solitons close to some critical value. This state may be treated as the small-dispersion limit, what makes it possible to analytically estimate all high-order statistical moments. While the focus of the study is made on the Korteweg–de Vries equation and its modified version, a much broader applicability of the results to equations that support soliton-type solutions is discussed.]]></summary>

In 1911, Jüttner proposed the generalization, for a relativistic gas, of the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of velocities. Here, we want to discuss, among others, the Jüttner probability density function (PDF). Both the velocity space and, consequently, the momentum space are not flat in special relativity. The velocity space corresponds to the Lobachevsky one, which has a negative curvature. This curvature induces a specific power for the Lorentz factor in the PDF, affecting the Jüttner normalization constant in one, two, and three dimensions. Furthermore, Jüttner distribution, written in terms of a more convenient variable, the rapidity, presents a curvature change at the origin at sufficiently high energy, which does not agree with our computational dynamics simulations of a relativistic gas. However, in one dimension, the rapidity satisfies a simple additivity law. This allows us to obtain, through the central limit theorem, a new, Lorentz-invariant, PDF whose curvature at the origin does not change for any energy value and which agrees with our computational dynamics simulations data. Also, we perform extensive first-principle simulations of a one-dimensional relativistic gas constituted by light and heavy particles.]]></summary>

A complex network has been widely used to reveal the rule of a complex system. How to convert the stock data into a network is an open issue since the stock data are so large and their random volatility is strong. In this paper, a seasonal trend decomposition procedure based on the loess ([math]) method is applied to convert the stock time series into a directed and weighted symbolic network. Three empirical stock datasets, including the closing price of Shanghai Securities Composite Index, S&P 500 Index, and Nikkei 225 Index, are considered. The properties of these stock time series are revealed from the topological characteristics of corresponding symbolic networks. The results show that: (1) both the weighted indegree and outdegree distributions obey the power-law distribution well; (2) fluctuations of stock closing price are revealed by related network topological properties, such as weighting degree, betweenness, pageranks, and clustering coefficient; and (3) stock closing price, in particular, periods such as financial crises, can be identified by modularity class of the symbolic networks. Moreover, the comparison between the [math] method and the visibility graph further highlights the advantages of the [math] method in terms of the time complexity of the algorithm. Our method offers a new idea to study the network conversion of stock time series.]]></summary>

How to determine the spatial distribution and population dynamics of animals are some of the key questions in ecology. These two have been coupled before, but there is no general method for determining spatial distributions based on instantanous behavior coupled with population dynamics. We propose modeling interacting populations with instantaneous habitat choice through mean-field games. By using the framework of variational inequalities, we are able to determine existence and uniqueness for habitat distributions of interacting populations, in both continuous and discrete habitats. With some additional restrictions, we are also able to show existence and uniqueness of fixed-points of the population dynamics along with spatial distributions. We illustrate our theoretical results by studying a Rosenzweig–MacArthur model where predators and consumers inhabit a continuous habitat. This study is conducted both theoretically and numerically. Analyzing the emergent dynamics is possible as viewing the system from the vantage point of variational inequalities allows for applying efficient numerical methods. The generality of our theoretical approach opens up for studying complex ecosystems, e.g. the impact of enrichment on spatial distributions in marine ecosystems.]]></summary>

Despite its widespread usage and extensive study in theoretical, experimental, and clinical works, many questions still remain about how best to administer it. Many mathematical studies have examined optimal scheduling of radiotherapy, and most come to similar conclusions. Importantly though, these studies generally assume intratumoral homogeneity. But in recent years, it has become clear that tumours are not homogeneous masses of cancerous cells, but wildly heterogeneous masses with various subpopulations which grow and respond to treatment differently.

Vegetation patterns with a variety of structures is amazing phenomena in arid or semi-arid areas, which can identify the evolution law of vegetation and are typical signals of ecosystem functions. Many achievements have been made in this respect, yet the mechanisms of uptake–diffusion feedback on the pattern structures of vegetation is not fully understood. To well reveal the influences of parameters perturbation on the pattern formation of vegetation, we give a comprehensive analysis on a vegetation–water model in the forms of reaction–diffusion equation which is posed by Zelnik et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci 112:12,327–12,331, 2015). We obtain the exact parameters range for stationary patterns and show the dynamical behaviors near the bifurcation point based on nonlinear analysis. It is found that the model has the properties of spot, labyrinth and gap patterns. Moreover, water diffusion rate prohibits the growth of vegetation while shading parameter promotes the increase of vegetation biomass. Our results show that gradual transitions from uniform state to gap pattern can occur for suitable value of parameters which may induce the emergence of desertification.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We investigate the transfer function emanating from the linearization of a car-following model for human drivers when taking into account their reaction time, which is known to be a cause of the stop-and-go traffic phenomenon. This leads to a nonrational transfer function, implying nontrivial stability conditions which are explicitly given. They are in particular satisfied whenever string stability holds. We also show how this reaction time can introduce a partial string stability, where the transfer function modulus remains smaller than 1 up to some critical frequency. We explore conditions in the parameter space discriminating between 3 different regimes (stability, string stability, and partial string stability).]]></summary>

To study disease transmission with vaccination based on the network, we map an SIR model to a site-bond percolation model. In the case where the vaccination probability is zero, this model degenerates into a bond percolation model without the immunization. Using the method of generation functions, we obtain exact theoretical results for the epidemic threshold and the average outbreak size. From these exact solutions, we find that the epidemic threshold increases while the average outbreak size decreases with vaccination probability. Numerical simulations show that the size of giant component S increases with transmissibility T but decreases with the probability of vaccination. In addition, we compare the epidemic threshold and the size of the giant component for a Poisson network, an exponential network and a power-law network using numerical simulations. When the probability of vaccination is fixed, the epidemic threshold is the smallest for heterogeneous networks and the size of giant component S in homogeneous networks becomes largest for large transmissibility T(T close to 1).]]></summary>

To speed-up the solution of parametrized differential problems, reduced order models (ROMs) have been developed over the years, including projection-based ROMs such as the reduced-basis (RB) method, deep learning-based ROMs, as well as surrogate models obtained through machine learning techniques. Thanks to its physics-based structure, ensured by the use of a Galerkin projection of the full order model (FOM) onto a linear low-dimensional subspace, the Galerkin-RB method yields approximations that fulfill the differential problem at hand. However, to make the assembling of the ROM independent of the FOM dimension, intrusive and expensive hyper-reduction techniques, such as the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), are usually required, thus making this strategy less feasible for problems characterized by (high-order polynomial or nonpolynomial) nonlinearities. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a novel strategy for learning nonlinear ROM operators using deep neural networks (DNNs). The resulting hyper-reduced order model enhanced by DNNs, to which we refer to as Deep-HyROMnet, is then a physics-based model, still relying on the RB method approach, however employing a DNN architecture to approximate reduced residual vectors and Jacobian matrices once a Galerkin projection has been performed. Numerical results dealing with fast simulations in nonlinear structural mechanics show that Deep-HyROMnets are orders of magnitude faster than POD-Galerkin-DEIM ROMs, still ensuring the same level of accuracy.]]></summary>

Nonsmooth systems are widely encountered in engineering fields. They have abundant dynamical phenomena, including some results on the complex dynamics in such systems under quasiperiodically forced excitations. In this work, we consider a quasiperiodically forced piecewise linear oscillator and show that strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) do exist in such nonsmooth systems. The generation and evolution mechanisms of SNAs are discussed. The torus-doubling, fractal, bubbling, and intermittency routes to SNAs are identified. The strange properties of SNAs are characterized with the aid of the phase sensitivity function, singular continuous spectrum, rational frequency approximation, and the path of the partial Fourier sum of state variables in a complex plane. The nonchaotic properties of SNAs are verified by the methods of maximum Lyapunov exponent and power spectrum.]]></summary>

Individuals can make choices for themselves that are beneficial or detrimental to the entire group. Consider two losing choices that some individuals have to make on behalf of the group. Is it possible that the losing choices combine to give a winning outcome? We show that it is possible through a variant of Parrondo’s paradox—the preference aggregation Parrondo’s paradox (PAPP). This new variant of Parrondo’s paradox makes use of an aggregate rule that combines with a decision-making heuristic that can be applied to individuals or parts of the social group. The aim of this work is to discuss this PAPP framework and exemplify it on a social network. This work enhances existing research by constructing a feedback loop that allows individuals in the social network to adapt its behavior according to the outcome of the Parrondo’s games played.]]></summary>

In this paper, we study a posteriori error estimates of the IMEX BDF2 scheme for time discretizations of solving parabolic partial integro-differential equations, which describe the jump-diffusion option pricing model in finance. Because of the initial singularities of the solution which is due to the nonsmoothness of the payoff function, a posteriori error control and adaptivity will be crucial in solving numerically this type of equations. To derive optimal order a posteriori error estimates, quadratic reconstructions for the IMEX BDF2 method are introduced. By using these continuous, piecewise time reconstructions, the upper and lower error bounds depending only on the discretization parameters and the data of the problems are derived. Based on these a posteriori error estimates, we further develop a time adaptive algorithm. The numerical implementations are performed with both nonuniform partitions and adaptivity in time. The adaptive algorithm reduce the computational cost substantially and provides efficient error control for the solution.]]></summary>

In this work we propose a new family of high order accurate semi-discrete discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes for the thermodynamically compatible discretization of overdetermined first order hyperbolic systems. In particular, we consider a first order hyperbolic model of turbulent shallow water flows, as well as the unified first order hyperbolic Godunov–Peshkov–Romenski (GPR) model of continuum mechanics, which is able to describe at the same time viscous fluids and nonlinear elastic solids at large deformations. Both PDE systems treated in this paper belong to the class of hyperbolic and thermodynamically compatible systems, since both satisfy an entropy inequality and the total energy conservation can be obtained as a direct consequence of all other governing equations via suitable linear combination with the corresponding thermodynamic dual variables. In this paper, we mimic this process for the first time also at the semi-discrete level at the aid of high order discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes. For the GPR model we directly discretize the entropy inequality and obtain total energy conservation as a consequence of a suitable discretization of all other evolution equations. For turbulent shallow water flows we directly discretize the nonconservative evolution equations related to the Reynolds stress tensor and obtain total energy conservation again as a result of the thermodynamically compatible discretization. As a consequence, for continuum mechanics the new DG schemes satisfy a cell entropy inequality directly by construction and thanks to the discrete thermodynamic compatibility they are provably nonlinearly stable in the energy norm for both systems under consideration.]]></summary>

The complexity of biological systems, and the increasingly large amount of associated experimental data, necessitates that we develop mathematical models to further our understanding of these systems. Because biological systems are generally not well understood, most mathematical models of these systems are based on experimental data, resulting in a seemingly heterogeneous collection of models that ostensibly represent the same system. To understand the system we therefore need to understand how the different models are related to each other, with a view to obtaining a unified mathematical description. This goal is complicated by the fact that a number of distinct mathematical formalisms may be employed to represent the same system, making direct comparison of the models very diff…]]></summary>

In this paper, we focus on the mathematical foundations of reduced order model (ROM) closures. First, we extend the verifiability concept from large eddy simulation to the ROM setting. Specifically, we call a ROM closure model verifiable if a small ROM closure model error (i.e., a small difference between the true ROM closure and the modeled ROM closure) implies a small ROM error. Second, we prove that the data-driven ROM closure studied here (i.e., the data-driven variational multiscale ROM) is verifiable. Finally, we investigate the verifiability of the data-driven variational multiscale ROM in the numerical simulation of the one-dimensional Burgers equation and a two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers

Formation of synchronous activity patterns is an essential property of neuronal networks that has been of central interest to synchronization theory. Chimera states, where both synchronous and asynchronous activities of neurons co-exist in a single network, are particularly poignant examples of such patterns, whose dynamics and multistability may underlie brain function, such as cognitive tasks. However, dynamical mechanisms of coherent state formation in spiking neuronal networks as well as ways to control these states remain unclear. In this paper, we take a step in this direction by considering the evolution of chimera states in a network of class II excitable Morris–Lecar neurons with asymmetrical nonlocal inhibitory connections. Using the adaptive coherence measure, we are able to partition the network parameter space into regions of various collective behaviors (antiphase synchronous clusters, traveling waves, different types of chimera states as well as a spiking death regime) and have shown multistability between the various regimes. We track the evolution of the chimera states as a function of changed key network parameters and found transitions between various types of chimera states. We further find that the network can demonstrate long transients leading to quasi-persistence of activity patterns in the border regions hinting at near-criticality behaviors.]]></summary>

Cancer cells at the tumor boundary move in the direction of the oxygen gradient, while cancer cells far within the tumor are in a necrotic state. This paper introduces a simple mathematical model that accounts for these facts. The model consists of cancer cells, cytotoxic T cells, and oxygen satisfying a system of partial differential equations. Some of the model parameters represent the effect of anti-cancer drugs. The tumor boundary is a free boundary whose dynamics is determined by the movement of cancer cells at the boundary. The model is simulated for radially symmetric and axially symmetric tumors, and it is shown that the tumor may increase or decrease in size, depending on the “strength" of the drugs. Existence theorems are proved, global in-time in the radially symmetric case, and local in-time for any shape of tumor. In the radially symmetric case, it is proved, under different conditions, that the tumor may shrink monotonically, or expand monotonically.]]></summary>

For large diffusivity, qualitative properties of the maximizers like symmetry will be addressed. Our results are in line with previous findings which assert that for large diffusion, concentrated resources are favorable for maximizing the total population. Then, an optimality condition for the maximizer is derived based upon rearrangement theory. We develop an efficient numerical algorithm applicable to domains with different geometries in order to compute the maximizer. It is established that the algorithm is convergent. Our numerical simulations give a real insight into the qualitative properties of the maximizer and also lead us to some conjectures about the maximizer.]]></summary>

We propose a novel stochastic Nesterov’s smoothing accelerated method for general nonsmooth, constrained, stochastic composite convex optimization, the nonsmooth component of which may be not easy to compute its proximal operator. The proposed method combines Nesterov’s smoothing accelerated method (Nesterov in Math Program 103(1):127–152, 2005) for deterministic problems and stochastic approximation for stochastic problems, which allows three variants: single sample and two different mini-batch sizes per iteration, respectively. We prove that all the three variants achieve the best-known complexity bounds in terms of stochastic oracle. Numerical results on a robust linear regression problem, as well as a support vector machine problem show that the proposed method compares favorably with other state-of-the-art first-order methods, and the variants with mini-batch sizes outperform the variant with single sample.]]></summary>

                     (d=1, 2, and 3), where the nonlocal nature is described by the mixed fractional Laplacians. Because the underlying solutions of the problem involving mixed fractional Laplacians decay slowly with certain power law at infinity, we employ the rational spectral-Galerkin method using rational basis (or mapped Gegenbauer functions) for the spatial approximation. To capture the intrinsic dissipative properties of the model equations, we combine the Crank-Nicolson scheme with exponential scalar auxiliary variable approach for the temporal discretization. Based on the rate of nonlocal energy dissipation, we design a novel time-stepping-varying strategy to enhance the efficiency of the scheme. We present the detailed implementation of the scheme, where the main building block of the stiffness matrices is based on the Laguerre-Gauss quadrature rule for the modified Bessel functions of the second kind. The existence, uniqueness, and nonlocal energy dissipation law of the fully discrete scheme are rigourously established. Numerical examples in 3D case are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the scheme. Finally, we simulate the nonlinear behaviors of 2D/3D dissipative vector solitary waves for damped sine-Gordon system I, for damped sine-Gordon system II, and for damped Klein–Gordon system to provide a deeper understanding of nonlocal physics.]]></summary>

Individual behaviors and social relations influence each other. However, understanding the underlying mechanism remains challenging. From social norms controlling human behavior to individual management of interpersonal relationships, rewards and punishments are some of the most commonly used measures. Through simulating the weak prisoner’s dilemma in finite populations, we find that neither a simple reward measure nor a pure punishment mechanism can extensively promote cooperation. Instead, a combination of appropriate punishment and reward mechanisms can promote cooperation’s prosperity regardless of how large or small the temptation to defect is. In addition, the combination spontaneously produces inhomogeneities in social relations and individual influence, which support the continued existence of cooperative behavior. Finally, we further explain how cooperators establish a sustainable existence under the combination by investigating the social relations at different moments in a small system. These results demonstrate that dispensing rewards and punishments impartially in society is essential to social harmony.]]></summary>

A novel heuristic approach is proposed here for time series data analysis, dubbed Generalized weighted permutation entropy, which amalgamates and generalizes beyond their original scope two well established data analysis methods: Permutation entropy and Weighted permutation entropy. The method introduces a scaling parameter to discern the disorder and complexity of ordinal patterns with small and large fluctuations. Using this scaling parameter, the complexity-entropy causality plane is generalized to the complexity-entropy-scale causality box. Simulations conducted on synthetic series generated by stochastic, chaotic, and random processes, as well as real world data, are shown to produce unique signatures in this three dimensional representation.]]></summary>

Discrete dynamical systems in which model components take on categorical values have been successfully applied to biological networks to study their global dynamic behavior. Boolean models in particular have been used extensively. However, multi-state models have also emerged as effective computational tools for the analysis of complex mechanisms underlying biological networks. Models in which variables assume more than two discrete states provide greater resolution, but this scheme introduces discontinuities. In particular, variables can increase or decrease by more than one unit in one time step. This can be corrected, without changing fixed points of the system, by applying an additional rule to each local activation function. On the other hand, if one is interested in cyclic attractors of their system, then this rule can potentially introduce new cyclic attractors that were not observed previously. This article makes some advancements in understanding the state space dynamics of multi-state network models with synchronous, sequential, or block-sequential update schedules and establishes conditions under which no new cyclic attractors are added to networks when the additional rule is applied. Our analytical results have the potential to be incorporated into modeling software and aid researchers in their analyses of biological multi-state networks.]]></summary>

In this paper, we apply the immersed interface method (IIM) and the hierarchical derivative matching (HDM) method, respectively, to restore the accuracy of the high-order alternating direction implicit finite-difference time-domain (ADI-FDTD) scheme of the 2D Maxwell’s equations with material interfaces. For the case of discontinuous permittivity

                    , we propose four high-order schemes. Two of them are of second order in time and fourth order in space (ADI-IIM-FDTD(2,4) scheme and ADI-HDM-FDTD(2,4) scheme). Others are of fourth order both in time and space (ADI-IIM-FDTD(4,4) scheme and ADI-HDM-FDTD(4,4) scheme). For the case of discontinuous permittivity

The proposed six schemes maintain the advantages of ADI-FDTD method such as unconditional stability and computational efficiency.

We study a dynamical system defined by a repeated game on a 1D lattice, in which the players keep track of their gross payoffs over time in a bank. Strategy updates are governed by a Boltzmann distribution, which depends on the neighborhood bank values associated with each strategy, relative to a temperature scale, which defines the random fluctuations. Players with higher bank values are, thus, less likely to change strategy than players with a lower bank value. For a parameterized rock–paper–scissors game, we derive a condition under which communities of a given strategy form with either fixed or drifting boundaries. We show the effect of a temperature increase on the underlying system and identify surprising properties of this model through numerical simulations.]]></summary>

With the outbreak of COVID-19, great loss and damage were brought to human society, making the study of epidemic spreading become a significant topic nowadays. To analyze the spread of infectious diseases among different areas, e.g., communities, cities, or countries, we construct a network, based on the epidemic model and the network coupling, whose nodes denote areas, and edges represent population migrations between two areas. Each node follows its dynamic, which describes an epidemic spreading among individuals in an area, and the node also interacts with other nodes, which indicates the spreading among different areas. By giving mathematical proof, we deduce that our model has a stable solution despite the network structure. We propose the peak infected ratio (PIR) as a property of infectious diseases in a certain area, which is not independent of the network structure. We find that increasing the population mobility or the disease infectiousness both cause higher peak infected population all over different by simulation. Furthermore, we apply our model to real-world data on COVID-19 and after properly adjusting the parameters of our model, the distribution of the peak infection ratio in different areas can be well fitted.]]></summary>

We investigate two types of avoided crossings in a chaotic billiard within the framework of information theory. The Shannon entropy in the phase space for the Landau–Zener interaction increases as the center of the avoided crossing is approached, whereas for the Demkov interaction, the Shannon entropy decreases as the center of avoided crossing is passed by with an increase in the deformation parameter. This feature can provide a new indicator for scar formation. In addition, it is found that the Fisher information of the Landau–Zener interaction is significantly larger than that of the Demkov interaction.]]></summary>

In this paper, we consider a three-tiered food web model in a chemostat, including chlorophenol, phenol, and hydrogen substrates and their degraders. The model takes into account the three substrate inflowing concentrations, as well as maintenance, that is, decay terms of the species. The operating diagrams give the asymptotic behavior of the model with respect to the four operating parameters, which are the dilution rate and the three inflowing concentrations of the substrates. These diagrams were obtained only numerically in the existing literature. Using the mathematical analysis of this model obtained in our previous studies, we construct the operating diagrams, by plotting the curves that separate their various regions. Hence, the regions of the operating diagrams are constructed analytically and there is no requirement for time-consuming algorithms to generate the plots, as in the numerical method. Moreover, our method reveals behaviors that have not been detected in the previous numerical studies. The growth functions are of Monod form with the inclusion of a product inhibition term. However, our method applies for a large class of growth functions. We construct operating diagrams with and without maintenance showing the role of maintenance on the stability of the system.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Adaptive Galerkin methods for time-dependent partial differential equations are studied and shown to be dissipative. The adaptation implies that the subset of the selected basis function changes over time according to the evolution of the solution. The corresponding projection operator is thus time-dependent and nondifferentiable. We therefore propose to use an integral formulation in time. We analyze the existence and uniqueness of this weak form of the dynamical Galerkin scheme, and we then prove that the nonsmooth projection operator introduces energy dissipation, which is a crucial result for adaptive Galerkin methods, e.g., adaptive wavelet methods. Numerical examples for the inviscid Burgers equation in one dimension and the incompressible Euler equations in two and three spatial dimensions show that the selection of basis functions, for instance by filtering out weak wavelet coefficients from the solution, introduces energy dissipation. Moreover, for the Burgers case we can show that adaptive wavelet regularization yields convergence of the truncated Galerkin solution to the physically relevant entropy solution. These results motivate adaptive wavelet-based Galerkin schemes for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws.]]></summary>

 Abstract.

We show that the bilayer interface does not move in the [math] time scale. The interface motion occurs in the [math] time scale and is determined by porous medium diffusion processes in both phases with no jumps on the interface. In the longer [math] time scale, the interface motion is a complex combination of porous medium diffusion processes in both phases and the property of mass conservation.]]></summary>

In this paper we consider a partially augmented fully-mixed variational formulation that has been recently proposed for the coupling of the stationary Brinkman–Forchheimer and double-diffusion equations, and develop an a posteriori error analysis for the 2D and 3D versions of the associated mixed finite element scheme. Indeed, we derive two reliable and efficient residual-based a posteriori error estimators for this problem on arbitrary (convex or non-convex) polygonal and polyhedral regions. The reliability of the proposed estimators draws mainly upon the uniform ellipticity and inf-sup condition of the forms involved, a suitable assumption on the data, stable Helmholtz decompositions in Hilbert and Banach frameworks, and the local approximation properties of the Clément and Raviart–Thomas operators. In turn, inverse inequalities, the localization technique based on bubble functions, and known results from previous works, are the main tools yielding the efficiency estimate. Finally, several numerical examples confirming the theoretical properties of the estimators and illustrating the performance of the associated adaptive algorithms, are reported. In particular, the case of flow through a 3D porous media with channel networks is considered.]]></summary>
