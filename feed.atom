In this paper, we consider recovering

                    dimensional signals from m binary measurements corrupted by noises and sign flips under the assumption that the target signals have low generative intrinsic dimension, i.e., the target signals can be approximately generated via an L-Lipschitz generator 
                      
                      \(G: \mathbb {R}^k\rightarrow \mathbb {R}^{n}, k\ll n\)
                      
                    . Although the binary measurements model is highly nonlinear, we propose a least square decoder and prove that, up to a constant c, with high probability, the least square decoder achieves a sharp estimation error

Extensive numerical simulations and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrated the least square decoder is robust to noise and sign flips, as indicated by our theory. By constructing a ReLU network with properly chosen depth and width, we verify the (approximately) deep generative prior, which is of independent interest.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We compute the critical surface for the existence of invariant tori of a family of Hamiltonian systems with two and three degrees of freedom. We use and compare two methods to compute the critical surfaces: renormalization-group transformations and conjugation in configuration space. We unveil the presence of cusps in the critical surface for the breakup of three-dimensional invariant tori of Hamiltonian systems with three degrees of freedom, whereas the critical surface of two-dimensional invariant tori of Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom is expected to be smooth.]]></summary>

In this work, we propose a new class of parallel time integrators for initial-value problems based on the well-known Picard iteration. To this end, we first investigate a class of sequential integrators, known as numerical Picard iteration methods, which falls into the general framework of deferred correction methods. We show that the numerical Picard iteration methods admit a 
                      
                      \(\min (J,M+1)\)
                      
                    -order rate of convergence, where J denotes the number of Picard iterations and 
                      
                      \(M+1\)
                      
                     is the number of collocation points. We then propose a class of parallel solvers so that J Picard iterations can be proceeded simultaneously and nearly constantly. We show that the parallel solvers yield the same convergence rate as that of the numerical Picard iteration methods. The main features of the proposed parallelized approach are as follows. (1) Instead of computing the solution point by point [as in revisionist integral deferred correction (RIDC) methods], the proposed methods proceed segment by segment. (2) The proposed approach leads to a higher speedup; the speedup is shown to be 
                      
                      \(J(M+1)\)
                      
                     (while the speedup of the Jth order RIDC is, at most, J). (3) The approach is applicable for non-uniform points, such as Chebyshev points. The stability region of the proposed methods is analyzed in detail, and we present numerical examples to verify the theoretical findings.]]></summary>

 Abstract. For a fixed “pattern” graph [math], the colored [math]-subgraph isomorphism problem (denoted by [math]) asks, given an [math]-vertex graph [math] and a coloring [math], whether [math] contains a properly colored copy of [math]. The complexity of this problem is tied to parameterized versions of [math] and [math], among other questions. An overarching goal is to understand the complexity of [math], under different computational models, in terms of natural invariants of the pattern graph [math]. In this paper, we establish a close relationship between the formula complexity of [math] and an invariant known as tree-depth (denoted by[math]).

In this paper, we develop a collocation method for solving third-kind Volterra integral equations.

 Abstract. The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a huge threat to global public health. Motivated by China’s experience of using Fangcang shelter hospitals (FSHs) to successfully combat the epidemic in its initial stages, we present a two-stage delay model considering the average waiting time of patients’ admission to study the impact of hospital beds and centralized quarantine on mitigating and controlling of the outbreak. We compute the basic reproduction number in terms of the hospital resources and perform a sensitivity analysis of the average waiting times of patients before admission to the hospitals. We conclude that, while designated hospitals save lives in severely infected individuals, the FSHs played a key role in mitigating and eventually curbing the epidemic. We also quantified some key epidemiological indicators, such as the final size of infections and deaths, the peak height and its timing, and the maximum occupation of beds in FSHs. Our study suggests that, for a jurisdiction (region or country) still struggling with COVID-19, when possible, it is essential to increase testing capacity and use a centralized quarantine to massively reduce the severity and magnitude of the epidemic that follows.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and myosin-dependent contraction can generate elastic stress and strain in living tissues, which may be dissipated by internal rearrangement through cell topological transition and cytoskeletal reorganization. Moreover, cells and tissues can change their sizes in response to mechanical cues. The present work demonstrates the role of tissue compressibility and internal rearranging activities on its size and mechanics regulation in the context of differential growth induced by a field of growth-promoting chemical factors. We develop a mathematical model based on finite elasticity and growth theory and the reference map techniques to describe the coupled tissue growth and mechanics in the Eulerian frame. We incorporate the tissue rearrangement by introducing a rearranging rate to the reference map evolution, leading to elastic-energy dissipation when tissue growth and deformation are in radial symmetry. By linearizing the model, we show that the stress follows the Maxwell-type viscoelastic relaxation. The rearrangement rate, which we call tissue fluidity, sets the stress relaxation time, and the ratio between the shear modulus and the fluidity sets the tissue viscosity. By nonlinear simulation of growing tissue spheroids and discs with graded growth rates along the radius, we find that the tissue compressibility and fluidity influence their equilibrium size. By comparing the nonlinear simulations with the linear analytical solutions, we show the size change as a nonlinear effect due to the advection of the tissue density flow, which only occurs when both tissue compressibility and fluidity are small. We apply the model to study tumor spheroid growth and epithelial disc growth when a reaction-diffusion process determines the growth-promoting factor field.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper is concerned with uniqueness of solution of the inverse diffraction by problems by a periodic curve with Dirichlet boundary condition in two dimensions. It is proved that the periodic curve can be uniquely determined by the near-field measurement data corresponding to infinitely many incident plane waves with distinct directions at a fixed frequency. Our proof is based on Schiffer’s idea which consists of two ingredients: (i) the total fields for incident plane waves with distinct directions are linearly independent, and (ii) for a fixed wave number there exist only finitely many linearly independent Dirichlet eigenfunctions in a bounded domain or in a closed waveguide under additional assumptions on the waveguide boundary. Based on the Rayleigh expansion, we prove that the phased near-field data can be uniquely determined by the phaseless near-field data in a bounded domain, with the exception of a finite set of incident angles. Such a phase retrieval result leads to a new uniqueness result for the inverse grating diffraction problem with phaseless near-field data at a fixed frequency. Since the incident direction determines the quasi-periodicity of the boundary value problem, our inverse issues are different from the existing results of [F. Hettlich and A. Kirsch, Inverse Problems, 13 (1997), pp. 351–361], where fixed-direction plane waves at multiple frequencies were considered.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We construct a formal gradient flow structure for phase-field evolution coupled to mechanics in Lagrangian coordinates, present common ways to couple the evolution, and provide an incremental minimization strategy. While the usual presentation of continuum mechanics is intentionally brief, we construct an extensible functional analytical framework and a discretization approach that preserves the underlying variational structure. We consider phase separation and swelling of gels and then study stationary states of multiphase systems with surface tension and contact lines and show the robustness of the general approach for large deformations. We highlight differences between compressible and incompressible models and discuss issues of the sharp-interface limit for different magnitudes of the Cahn–Hilliard mobility.]]></summary>

This paper aims to explore a robust and efficient discrete scheme for poroelastic-elastic coupled problems. Based on staggered grids, a discrete scheme using finite difference methods is constructed in a form similar to domain decomposition. On this basis, another discrete scheme with a uniform form over the entire domain is derived. These two discrete schemes serve different purposes and are shown to be equivalent. The stability is easily derived by establishing a discrete variational formulation. To prove the convergence, appropriate discrete interpolations are introduced. It is proved that the discrete scheme has second-order superconvergence. Then, combined with the inf-sup condition, the first-order uniform convergence is obtained. This means the discrete scheme has great potential to overcome Poisson locking and pressure oscillations. Some numerical experiments are also carried out, and the results show the robustness and efficiency of the discrete scheme.]]></summary>

We present two finite difference time domain methods for the biharmonic nonlinear Schrödinger equation (BNLS) by reformulating it into a system of second-order partial differential equations instead of a direct discretization, including a second-order conservative Crank–Nicolson finite difference (CNFD) method and a second-order semi-implicit finite difference (SIFD) method. The CNFD method conserves the mass and energy in the discretized level, and the SIFD method only needs to solve a linear system at each time step, which is more efficient. By energy method, we establish optimal error bounds at the order of 
                      
                      \( O(h^2+\tau ^2) \)

 Abstract. In this research, we propose an online basis enrichment strategy within the framework of a recently developed constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale discontinuous Galerkin method. Combining the technique of oversampling, one makes use of the information of the current residuals to adaptively construct basis functions in the online stage to reduce the error of multiscale approximation. A complete analysis of the method is presented, which shows the proposed online enrichment leads to a fast convergence from multiscale approximation to the fine-scale solution. The error reduction can be made sufficiently large by suitably selecting oversampling regions and the number of oversampling layers. Further, the convergence rate of the enrichment algorithm depends on a factor of exponential decay regarding the number of oversampling layers and a user-defined parameter. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed online adaptive algorithm.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We present a butterfly-compressed representation of the Hadamard–Babich (HB) ansatz for the Green’s function of the high-frequency Helmholtz equation in smooth inhomogeneous media. For a computational domain discretized with [math] discretization cells, the proposed algorithm first solves and tabulates the phase and HB coefficients via eikonal and transport equations with observation points and point sources located at the Chebyshev nodes using a set of much coarser computation grids, and then butterfly compresses the resulting HB interactions from all [math] cell centers to each other. The overall CPU time and memory requirement scale as [math] for any bounded two-dimensional (2D) domains with arbitrary excitation sources. A direct extension of this scheme to bounded 3D domains yields an [math] CPU complexity, which can be further reduced to quasi-linear complexities with proposed remedies. The scheme can also efficiently handle scattering problems involving inclusions in inhomogeneous media. Although the current construction of our HB integrator does not accommodate caustics, the resulting HB integrator itself can be applied to certain sources, such as concave-shaped sources, to produce caustic effects. Compared to finite-difference frequency domain methods, the proposed HB integrator is free of numerical dispersion and requires fewer discretization points per wavelength. As a result, it can solve wave propagation problems well beyond the capability of existing solvers. Remarkably, the proposed scheme can accurately model wave propagation in 2D domains with 640 wavelengths per direction and in 3D domains with 54 wavelengths per direction on a state-of-the-art supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this article we develop the constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) for elliptic partial differential equations with inhomogeneous Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions, and the high contrast property emerges from the coefficients of elliptic operators and Robin boundary conditions. By careful construction of multiscale bases of the CEM-GMsFEM, we introduce two operators [math] and [math] which are used to handle inhomogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary values and are also proved to converge independently of contrast ratios as enlarging oversampling regions. We providean a priori error estimate and show that the number of oversampling layers is the key factor in controlling numerical errors. A series of experiments are conducted, and those results reflect the reliability of our methods even with high contrast ratios.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we present strong numerical evidence that the incompressible axisymmetric Euler equations with degenerate viscosity coefficients and smooth initial data of finite energy develop a potential finite-time locally self-similar singularity at the origin. An important feature of this potential singularity is that the solution develops a two-scale traveling wave that travels toward the origin. The two-scale feature is characterized by the scaling property that the center of the traveling wave is located at a ring of radius [math] surrounding the symmetry axis while the thickness of the ring collapses at a rate [math]. The driving mechanism for this potential singularity is due to an antisymmetric vortex dipole that generates a strong shearing layer in both the radial and axial velocity fields. Without the viscous regularization, the three-dimensional Euler equations develop a sharp front and some shearing instability in the far field. On the other hand, the Navier–Stokes equations with a constant viscosity coefficient regularize the two-scale solution structure and do not develop a finite-time singularity for the same initial data.]]></summary>

In this work, we propose a model order reduction framework to deal with inverse problems in a non-intrusive setting. Inverse problems, especially in a partial differential equation context, require a huge computational load due to the iterative optimization process. To accelerate such a procedure, we apply a numerical pipeline that involves artificial neural networks to parametrize the boundary conditions of the problem in hand, compress the dimensionality of the (full-order) snapshots, and approximate the parametric solution manifold. It derives a general framework capable to provide an ad-hoc parametrization of the inlet boundary and quickly converges to the optimal solution thanks to model order reduction. We present in this contribution the results obtained by applying such methods to two different CFD test cases.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We develop a probabilistic characterization of trajectorial divergence rates in nonautonomous stochastic dynamical systems that are systematically shown to be suitable for uncertainty quantification in Lagrangian (trajectory-based) predictions. We construct scalar fields of finite-time divergence rates which are rooted in information theory/geometry, and we show their existence and space-time continuity for general stochastic flows. Combining these divergence rate fields with information inequalities derived in [M. Branicki and K. Uda, SIAM/ASA J. Uncertain. Quantif., 9 (2021), pp. 1242–1313] allows for a principled quantification of Lagrangian uncertainty in a given dynamics, as well as a mitigation of the uncertainty in path-based observables estimated from simplified models of the truth/reference dynamics in a way that is amenable to algorithmic implementations. This approach can be utilized in information-geometric analysis of statistical estimation and inference, as well as in a data-driven machine learning of reduced-order models. We also derive a link between the divergence rates and finite-time Lyapunov exponents for probability measures and for path-based observables.]]></summary>

 Abstract. It is well known for experts that resonances in nonlinear systems lead to new invariant objects that lead to new behaviors. The goal of this paper is to study the invariant sets generated by resonances under foliation preserving torus maps. They are a special kind of torus maps which preserve a foliation of irrational lines [math]. Foliation preserving maps appear naturally as a reparameterization of linear flows in the torus and also play an important role in several applications involving coupled oscillators, delay equations, resonators with moving walls, etc. The invariant objects we find here lead to predictions on the behavior of these models. Since the results of this paper are meant to be applied to other problems, we have developed very quantitative results giving explicit descriptions of the phenomena and the invariant objects that control them. The structure of the phase locking regions for foliation preserving maps is different than for generic maps of the torus. Indeed, for the sake of completeness, we have developed a similar analysis for the case of generic maps of the torus and shown that the objects that appear in foliation preserving maps are quantitatively and qualitatively different from those of generic torus maps. This has consequences in applications.]]></summary>

The equation of state (EOS) embodies thermodynamic properties of compressible fluid materials and usually has very complicated forms in real engineering applications. The complexity of EOS in form gives rise to the difficulty in analyzing relevant wave patterns and in designing efficient numerical algorithms. In this paper, a strategy of local stiffened gas approximation is proposed for computing compressible fluid flows of real materials. The stiffened gas EOS is used to approximate general EOSs locally with certain thermodynamic compatibility at each interface of computational control volumes so that the exact Riemann solver can be significantly simplified and the computational cost of the resulting scheme is reduced up to two orders of magnitude. Then the generalized Riemann problem solver is further adopted not only to increase the accuracy and resolution but also to effectively reflect the thermodynamic effect through the inclusion of entropy variation into the numerical fluxes. The resulting scheme is demonstrated to be efficient and robust through typical numerical examples which display the excellent performance of such an approximation under extreme thermodynamics.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Many physical, epidemiological, or physiological dynamical processes on networks support front-like propagation, where an initial localized perturbation grows and systematically invades all nodes in the network. A key problem is then to extract estimates for the dynamics. In particular, if a single node is seeded at a small concentration, when will other nodes reach the same initial concentration? Here, motivated by the study of toxic protein propagation in neurodegenerative diseases, we present and compare three different estimates for the arrival time in order of increasing analytical complexity: the linear arrival time, obtained by linearizing the underlying dynamical system; the Lambert time, obtained by considering the interaction of pairs of nodes; and the nonlinear arrival time, obtained by asymptotic techniques. We use the classic Fisher–Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov equation as a paradigm for the dynamics and show that each method provides different insights but consistent time estimates. Further, we show that the nonlinear asymptotic method also gives an approximate solution, valid in the entire domain, and the correct ordering of arrival regions over large regions of parameters and initial conditions.]]></summary>

Data used in particle physics analyses have an imbalanced nature in which the events of interest are rare due to the broad background. These events can be identified from bulk by intensive computational studies including application of sophisticated analysis techniques. Classification algorithms provided by supervised machine learning (ML) approaches can be utilized to interpret skewed particle dataset as an alternative to the classic techniques even for multi particle state analysis.

For this purpose, five widely used oversampling and two hybrid strategies, using over and under resampling together, were adjusted to RFC. Moreover, class weights applied RFC, weighted random forest (WRF), was used in the analysis. Due to the data structure, performance of the applied models was evaluated by the derivatives of confusion matrix. It is revealed that hybrid techniques implemented in RFC is suitable for handling highly imbalanced classes.

The quadrature-based method of moments (QMOM) offers a promising class of approximation techniques for reducing kinetic equations to fluid equations that are valid beyond thermodynamic equilibrium. In this work, we study a particular five-moment variant of QMOM known as HyQMOM and establish that this system is moment-invertible over a convex region in solution space. We then develop a high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for solving the resulting fluid system. The scheme is based on a predictor–corrector approach, where the prediction is a localized space-time DG scheme. The nonlinear algebraic system in this prediction is solved using a Picard iteration. The correction is a straightforward explicit update based on the time-integral of the evolution equation, where the space-time prediction replaces all instances of the exact solution. In the absence of limiters, the high-order scheme does not guarantee that solutions remain in the convex set over which HyQMOM is moment-realizable. To overcome this, we introduce novel limiters that rigorously guarantee that the computed solution does not leave the convex set of realizable solutions, thus guaranteeing the hyperbolicity of the system. We develop positivity-preserving limiters in both the prediction and correction steps and an oscillation limiter that damps unphysical oscillations near shocks. We also develop a novel extension of this scheme to include a BGK collision operator; the proposed method is shown to be asymptotic-preserving in the high-collision limit. The HyQMOM and the HyQMOM-BGK solvers are verified on several test cases, demonstrating high-order accuracy on smooth problems and shock-capturing capability on problems with shocks. The asymptotic-preserving property of the HyQMOM-BGK solver is also numerically verified.]]></summary>
