We study dynamics of a generic quadratic diffeomorphism, a 3D generalization of the planar Hénon map. Focusing on the dissipative, orientation preserving case, we give a comprehensive parameter study of codimension-one and two bifurcations. Periodic orbits, born at resonant, Neimark–Sacker bifurcations, give rise to Arnold tongues in parameter space. Aperiodic attractors include invariant circles and chaotic orbits; these are distinguished by rotation number and Lyapunov exponents. Chaotic orbits include Hénon-like and Lorenz-like attractors, which can arise from period-doubling cascades, and those born from the destruction of invariant circles. The latter lie on paraboloids near the local unstable manifold of a fixed point.]]></summary>

Change point detection (CPD) for multi-agent systems helps one to evaluate the state and better control the system. Multivariate CPD methods solve the [math] time series well; however, the multi-agent systems often produce the [math] dimensional data, where [math] is the dimension of multivariate observations, [math] is the total observation time, and [math] is the number of agents. In this paper, we propose two valid approaches based on higher-order features, namely, the Betti number feature extraction and the Persistence feature extraction, to compress the [math]-dimensional features into one dimension so that general CPD methods can be applied to higher-dimensional data. First, a topological structure based on the Vietoris–Rips complex is constructed on each time-slice snapshot. Then, the Betti number and persistence of the topological structures are obtained to separately constitute two feature matrices for change point estimates. Higher-order features primarily describe the data distribution on each snapshot and are, therefore, independent of the node correspondence cross snapshots, which gives our methods unique advantages in processing missing data. Experiments in multi-agent systems demonstrate the significant performance of our methods. We believe that our methods not only provide a new tool for dimensionality reduction and missing data in multi-agent systems but also have the potential to be applied to a wider range of fields, such as complex networks.]]></summary>

This paper investigates partial topology identification of simplicial complexes based on adaptive synchronization. For the nodes of interest, the interactions that they participate in can be accurately reconstructed by designing adaptive controllers and parameter estimators. Particularly, not only pairwise interactions but a higher-order structure can be effectively recovered by our method. Moreover, a new linear independence condition with a rigorous definition is established for parameter estimators to converge asymptotically to the true values. Numerical simulations on a general two-dimensional simplicial complex as well as a real-world structure are provided to show the validity of the result and discuss the influence of different parameters on the identification process.]]></summary>

However, our knowledge of how best to design these costly experiments and the effect that our choices have on the quality of the data produced is lacking. Here, we tackle this issue by developing FORE-CAST, a Python package that supports the accurate simulation of cell-sorting and sequencing based MPRAs and robust maximum like-lihood based inference of genetic design function from MPRA data. We use FORECASTs capabilities to reveal rules for MPRA experimental design that help ensure accurate genotype-to-phenotype links and show how the simulation of MPRA experiments can help us better understand the limits of prediction accuracy when this data is used for training deep learning based classifiers. As the scale and scope of MPRAs grows, tools like FORECAST will help ensure we make informed decisions during their development and the most of the data produced.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The end-to-end fusion of enzymes that catalyse successive steps in a reaction pathway is a metabolic engineering strategy that has been successfully applied in a variety of pathways and is particularly common in terpene bioproduction. Despite its popularity, limited work has been done to interrogate the mechanism of metabolic enhancement from enzyme fusion. We observed a remarkable >110-fold improvement in nerolidol production upon translational fusion of nerolidol synthase (a sesquiterpene synthase) to farnesyl diphosphate synthase. This delivered a titre increase from 29.6 mg/L up to 4.2 g/L nerolidol in a single engineering step. Whole-cell proteomic analysis revealed that nerolidol synthase levels in the fusion strains were greatly elevated compared to the non-fusion control. Similarly, the fusion of nerolidol synthase to non-catalytic domains also produced comparable increases in titre, which coincided with improved enzyme expression. When farnesyl diphosphate synthase was fused to other terpene synthases, we observed more modest improvements in terpene titre (1.9- and 3.8-fold), which corresponds to increases of a similar magnitude in terpene synthase expression. Therefore, increased in vivo enzyme levels, resulting from improved expression and/or stability, is likely to be a major driver of catalytic enhancement from enzyme fusion.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A ratiometric response gives an output that is proportional to the ratio between the magnitudes of two inputs. Ratio computation has been observed in nature and is also needed in the development of smart probiotics and organoids. Here, we achieve ratiometric gene expression response in bacteria E. coli with the incoherent merger network. In this network, one input molecule activates expression of the output protein while the other molecule activates an intermediate protein that enhances the outputs degradation. When degradation rate is first order and faster than dilution, the output responds linearly to the ratio between the input molecules levels over a wide range with R2 close to 1. Response sensitivity can be quantitatively tuned by varying the outputs translation rate. Furthermore, ratiometric responses are robust to global perturbations in cellular components that influence gene expression because such perturbations affect the output through an incoherent feedforward loop. This work demonstrates a new molecular signal processing mechanism for multiplexed sense-and-respond circuits that are robust to intra-cellular context.]]></summary>

Human themselves are not able to catabolize erythritol and their gut microbes lack related catabolic pathways either to metabolize erythritol. Here, we engineer Escherichia coli to utilize erythritol as sole carbon source aiming for defined applications. First, we isolate the erythritol metabolic gene cluster and experimentally characterize the erythritol-binding transcriptional repressor and its DNA-binding site. Transcriptome analysis suggests that carbohydrate metabolism-related genes in the engineered E. coli are overall upregulated, which then guides the selection of four genes for overexpression that notably enhances cell growth. Finally, engineered E. coli strains can be used as a living detector to distinguish erythritol-containing soda soft drinks and can grow in the simulated intestinal fluid supplemented with erythritol. We expect our work will inspire the engineering of more hosts to respond and utilize erythritol for broad applications in metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, and biomedical engineering.]]></summary>

Within the framework of p-adaptive flux reconstruction, we aim to construct efficient polynomial multigrid (pMG) preconditioners for implicit time integration of the Navier–Stokes equations using Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov (JFNK) methods. We hypothesise that in pseudo transient continuation (PTC), as the residual drops, the frequency of error modes that dictates the convergence rate gets higher and higher. We apply nonlinear pMG solvers to stiff steady problems at low Mach number (

Summation-By-Parts (SBP) methods provide a systematic way of constructing provably stable numerical schemes. However, many proofs of convergence and accuracy rely on the assumption that the SBP operator possesses a particular eigenvalue property. In this note, three results pertaining to this property are proven. Firstly, the eigenvalue property does not hold for all nullspace consistent SBP operators. Secondly, this issue can be addressed without affecting the accuracy of the method by adding a specially designed, arbitrarily small perturbation term to the SBP operator. Thirdly, all pseudospectral methods satisfy the eigenvalue property.]]></summary>

Implementing deep neural networks for learning the solution maps of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) turns out to be more efficient than using many conventional numerical methods. However, limited theoretical analyses have been conducted on this approach. In this study, we investigate the expressive power of deep rectified quadratic unit (ReQU) neural networks for approximating the solution maps of parametric PDEs. The proposed approach is motivated by the recent important work of Kutyniok et al. (Constr Approx 1–53, 2021), which uses deep rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks for solving parametric PDEs. In contrast to the previously established complexity-bound 
                      
                      \(\mathcal {O}\left( d^3\log _{2}^{q}(1/ \epsilon ) \right) \)
                      
                     for ReLU neural networks, we derive an upper bound

                    , where d is the dimension of reduced basis representing the solutions. Our method takes full advantage of the inherent low-dimensionality of the solution manifolds and better approximation performance of deep ReQU neural networks. Numerical experiments are performed to verify our theoretical result.]]></summary>

This paper studies the sliding mode control method for coupled delayed fractional reaction-diffusion Cohen–Grossberg neural networks on a directed non-strongly connected topology. A novel fractional integral sliding mode surface and the corresponding control law are designed to realize global Mittag-Leffler synchronization. The sufficient conditions for synchronization and reachability of the sliding mode surface are derived via the hierarchical method and the Lyapunov method. Finally, simulations are provided to verify our theoretical findings.]]></summary>

Populations of globally coupled phase oscillators are described in the thermodynamic limit by kinetic equations for the distribution densities or, equivalently, by infinite hierarchies of equations for the order parameters. Ott and Antonsen [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008)] have found an invariant finite-dimensional subspace on which the dynamics is described by one complex variable per population. For oscillators with Cauchy distributed frequencies or for those driven by Cauchy white noise, this subspace is weakly stable and, thus, describes the asymptotic dynamics. Here, we report on an exact finite-dimensional reduction of the dynamics outside of the Ott–Antonsen subspace. We show that the evolution from generic initial states can be reduced to that of three complex variables, plus a constant function. For identical noise-free oscillators, this reduction corresponds to the Watanabe–Strogatz system of equations [Watanabe and Strogatz, Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 2391 (1993)]. We discuss how the reduced system can be used to explore the transient dynamics of perturbed ensembles.]]></summary>

Different from the linear counterpart, elastic wave propagation in nonlinear elastic metamaterials with damping (EMD) systems has much more novel behaviors. It is little work that reveals the nonlinear wave propagation mechanism in the nonlinear EMD in the literature. In this paper, nonlinear EMD systems with different configurations for the nonlinear elements are constructed to study the nonlinear wave propagation characteristics based on the analytical formulation. Nonlinear wave propagation attenuation characteristics in nonlinear EMD systems are studied in the frequency-domain. Spectro-spatial characteristics of nonlinear traveling wave packet in space- and time-domain are also analyzed to reveal space frequency-domain characteristics. Influences of different configurations for the nonlinear elements on wave propagation in nonlinear EMD systems are discussed. Results shown that locations of band structures can be tuned by changing intensities of nonlinearities in the nonlinear EMD systems, which are not found in the linear system. Moreover, different configurations for the nonlinear elements can lead to localization feature emerged in a nonlinear EMD system, which indicates solitary waves causing from the interaction between dispersion and nonlinearity exist in the nonlinear systems. This interesting wave propagating properties can be used to design new devices for acoustic switches, energy harvesting, and broadband vibration control.]]></summary>

Systems of nonlinear chemical oscillators can exhibit a large diversity of non-trivial states depending on the parameters that characterize them. Among these, a synchronization phenomenon is of special interest due to its direct link with chemical and biological processes in nature. We carry out numerical experiments for two different sets of chemical oscillators with different properties and immersed in a Belousov–Zhabotinsky solution. We document the emergence of different states of synchronization that depend on the parameters characterizing the solution. We also show that, in the interface regions, this system generates a stable dynamics of intermittency between the different synchronization states where interesting phenomena, such as the “devil's staircase,” emerge. In general, the added complexity introduced with the additional set of oscillators results in more complex non-trivial synchronization states.]]></summary>

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder with recurrent seizures, which convey complex dynamical characteristics including chaos and randomness. Until now, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated, especially the bistable property beneath the epileptic random induction phenomena in certain conditions. Inspired by the recent finding that astrocyte GTPase-activating protein (G-protein)-coupled receptors could be involved in stochastic epileptic seizures, we proposed a neuron–astrocyte network model, incorporating the noise of the astrocytic second messenger, inositol triphosphate (IP3) that is modulated by G-protein-coupled receptor activation. Based on this model, we have statistically analyzed the transitions of epileptic seizures by performing repeatable simulation trials. Our simulation results show that the increase in the IP3 noise intensity induces depolarization-block epileptic seizures together with an increase in neuronal firing frequency, consistent with corresponding experiments. Meanwhile, the bistable states of the seizure dynamics were present under certain noise intensities, during which the neuronal firing pattern switches between regular sparse spiking and epileptic seizure states. This random presence of epileptic seizures is absent when the noise intensity continues to increase, accompanying with an increase in the epileptic depolarization block duration. The simulation results also shed light on the fact that calcium signals in astrocytes play significant roles in the pattern formations of the epileptic seizure. Our results provide a potential pathway for understanding the epileptic randomness in certain conditions.]]></summary>

As seen by an observer in the rotating frame, the earth’s small spheroidal deformations neutralize the centrifugal force, leaving only the smaller Coriolis force to govern the “inertial” motion of objects that move on its surface, assumed smooth and frictionless. Previous studies of inertial motion employ weakly spheroidal equations of motion that ignore the influence of the centrifugal force and yet treat the earth as a sphere. The latitude dependence of these equations renders them strongly nonlinear. We derive and justify these equations and use them to identify, classify, name, describe, and illustrate all possible classes of inertial motion, including a new class of motion called circumpolar waves, which encircle both poles during each cycle of the motion. We illustrate these classes using CorioVis, our freely available Coriolis visualization software. We identify a rotational/time-reversal symmetry for motion on the earth’s surface and use this symmetry to develop and validate closed-form small-amplitude approximations for the four main classes and one degenerate class of inertial motion. For these five classes, we supply calculations of experimentally relevant frequencies, zonal drifts, and latitude ranges.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) mediate many fundamental cellular processes and their control through optically or chemically responsive protein domains has a profound impact on basic research and some clinical applications. Most available chemogenetic methods induce the association, i.e., dimerization or oligomerization, of target proteins, and the few available dissociation approaches either break large oligomeric protein clusters or heteromeric complexes. Here, we have exploited the controlled dissociation of a dimeric oxidoreductase from mycobacteria (MSMEG_2027) by its native cofactor, F420, which is not present in mammals, as a bioorthogonal monomerization switch. We found that in the absence of F420, MSMEG_2027 forms a unique domain-swapped dimer that occludes the cofactor binding site. Substantial remodelling of the intertwined N-terminal helix upon F420 binding results in the dissolution of the dimer. We then show that MSMEG_2027 can be expressed as fusion proteins in human cells and apply it as a tool to induce and release MAPK/ERK signalling downstream of a chimeric fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) tyrosine kinase. This F420-dependent chemogenetic de-dimerization tool is stoichiometric, based on a single domain and presents a novel mechanism to investigate protein complexes in situ.]]></summary>

The influence of different parameters on the resulting approximation error is discussed. Further important factors that are taken into account are the choice of time integrator and the initial data for the micro problem which has to be set appropriately to get a consistent scheme.

The saddle point (SP) calculation is a grand challenge for computationally intensive energy function in computational chemistry area, where the saddle point may represent the transition state. The traditional methods need to evaluate the gradients of the energy function at a very large number of locations. To reduce the number of expensive computations of the true gradients, we propose an active learning framework consisting of a statistical surrogate model, Gaussian process regression (GPR) for the energy function, and a single-walker dynamics method, gentle accent dynamics (GAD), for the saddle-type transition states. SP is detected by the GAD applied to the GPR surrogate for the gradient vector and the Hessian matrix. Our key ingredient for efficiency improvements is an active learning method which sequentially designs the most informative locations and takes evaluations of the original model at these locations to train GPR. We formulate this active learning task as the optimal experimental design problem and propose a very efficient sample-based sub-optimal criterion to construct the optimal locations. We show that the new method significantly decreases the required number of energy or force evaluations of the original model.]]></summary>

The generalized Biot-Brinkman equations describe the displacement, pressures and fluxes in an elastic medium permeated by multiple viscous fluid networks and can be used to study complex poromechanical interactions in geophysics, biophysics and other engineering sciences. These equations extend on the Biot and multiple-network poroelasticity equations on the one hand and Brinkman flow models on the other hand, and as such embody a range of singular perturbation problems in realistic parameter regimes. In this paper, we introduce, theoretically analyze and numerically investigate a class of three-field finite element formulations of the generalized Biot-Brinkman equations. By introducing appropriate norms, we demonstrate that the proposed finite element discretization, as well as an associated preconditioning strategy, is robust with respect to the relevant parameter regimes. The theoretical analysis is complemented by numerical examples.]]></summary>

Understanding the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of AMPs can direct the synthesis of desirable therapeutics. In this study, we use machine learning-guided directed evolution to develop the lipopolysaccharide-binding domain (LBD), which acts as a functional domain of anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF), a family of AMPs, identified from Marsupenaeus japonicus. We report the identification of LBDA-D as an output of this algorithm with the input of the original LBDMj sequence and show the NMR solution structure of LBDB, which possesses a circular extended structure with a disulfide crosslink in each terminus and two 310-helices and exhibits a broad antimicrobial spectrum. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed LBDB induced the formation of a cluster of bacteria wrapped in a flexible coating that ruptured and consequently killed the bacteria. The co-injection of LBDB and Vibrio alginolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus and another major pathogen in shrimp aquaculture white spot syndrome virus in vivo improved the survival of M. japonicus, indicating a promising therapeutic role of LBDB for infectious disease. The findings of this study pave the way for the rational drug design of activity-enhanced peptide antibiotics.]]></summary>

We previously demonstrated that activation of the galactose (GAL) regulon, a regulatory structure used by this yeast to coordinate substrate utilization with biomass formation during growth on galactose, during growth on the non-native substrate xylose results in a vastly altered gene expression profile and faster growth compared with constitutive overexpression of the same heterologous catabolic pathway. However, this effort involved the creation of a xylose-inducible variant of Gal3p (Gal3pSyn4.1), the sensor protein of the GAL regulon, preventing this semi-synthetic regulon approach from being easily adapted to additional non-native substrates. Here, we report the construction of a variant Gal3pMC(metabolic coordinator) that exhibits robust GAL regulon activation in the presence of structurally diverse substrates and recapitulates the dynamics of the native system. Multiple molecular modeling studies confirm that Gal3pMC occupies conformational states corresponding to galactose-bound Gal3p in an inducer-independent manner. Using Gal3pMC to test a regulon approach to the assimilation of the non-native lignocellulosic sugars xylose, arabinose, and cellobiose yields higher growth rates and final cell densities when compared with a constitutive overexpression of the same set of catabolic genes. The subsequent demonstration of rapid and complete co-utilization of all three non-native substrates suggests that Gal3pMC-mediated dynamic global gene expression changes by GAL regulon activation may be universally beneficial for engineering synthetic heterotrophy.]]></summary>

We propose and analyze an unfitted finite element method of arbitrary order for solving elliptic problems on domains with curved boundaries and interfaces. The approximation space on the whole domain is obtained by the direct extension of the finite element space defined on interior elements, in the sense that there is no degree of freedom locating in boundary/interface elements. We apply a non-symmetric bilinear form and the boundary/jump conditions are imposed in a weak sense in the scheme. The method is shown to be stable without any mesh adjustment or any special stabilization. The optimal convergence rate under the energy norm is derived, and

Models of coupled oscillator networks play an important role in describing collective synchronization dynamics in biological and technological systems. The Kuramoto model describes oscillator’s phase evolution and explains the transition from incoherent to coherent oscillations under simplifying assumptions, including all-to-all coupling with uniform strength. Real world networks, however, often display heterogeneous connectivity and coupling weights that influence the critical threshold for this transition. We formulate a general mean-field theory (Vlasov–Focker Planck equation) for stochastic Kuramoto-type phase oscillator models, valid for coupling graphs/networks with heterogeneous connectivity and coupling strengths, using graphop theory in the mean-field limit. Considering symmetric odd-valued coupling functions, we mathematically prove an exact formula for the critical threshold for the incoherence–coherence transition. We numerically test the predicted threshold using large finite-size representations of the network model. For a large class of graph models, we find that the numerical tests agree very well with the predicted threshold obtained from mean-field theory. However, the prediction is more difficult in practice for graph structures that are sufficiently sparse. Our findings open future research avenues toward a deeper understanding of mean-field theories for heterogeneous systems.]]></summary>

A fundamental analytical assessment is the partition function in the canonical ensemble to derive statistical, thermodynamical, and information measures. They are also analytical, dependent on the number of particles, consistent with the theory for high temperatures, and rising some limitations at shallow temperatures, giving us a notion of the classicality of the system defining an interval of temperatures where the model is well working.]]></summary>

The ultimate purpose of the statistical analysis of ordinal patterns is to characterize the distribution of the features they induce. In particular, knowing the joint distribution of the pair entropy-statistical complexity for a large class of time series models would allow statistical tests that are unavailable to date. Working in this direction, we characterize the asymptotic distribution of the empirical Shannon’s entropy for any model under which the true normalized entropy is neither zero nor one. We obtain the asymptotic distribution from the central limit theorem (assuming large time series), the multivariate delta method, and a third-order correction of its mean value. We discuss the applicability of other results (exact, first-, and second-order corrections) regarding their accuracy and numerical stability. Within a general framework for building test statistics about Shannon’s entropy, we present a bilateral test that verifies if there is enough evidence to reject the hypothesis that two signals produce ordinal patterns with the same Shannon’s entropy. We applied this bilateral test to the daily maximum temperature time series from three cities (Dublin, Edinburgh, and Miami) and obtained sensible results.]]></summary>

A vast body of experiments share the view that social norms are major factors for the emergence of fairness in a population of individuals playing the dictator game (DG). Recently, to explore which social norms are conducive to sustaining cooperation has obtained considerable concern. However, thus, far few studies have investigated how social norms influence the evolution of fairness by means of indirect reciprocity. In this study, we propose an indirect reciprocal model of the DG and consider that an individual can be assigned as the dictator due to its good reputation. We investigate the “leading eight” norms and all second-order social norms by a two-timescale theoretical analysis. We show that when role assignment is based on reputation, four of the “leading eight” norms, including stern judging and simple standing, lead to a high level of fairness, which increases with the selection intensity. Our work also reveals that not only the correct treatment of making a fair split with good recipients but also distinguishing unjustified unfair split from justified unfair split matters in elevating the level of fairness.]]></summary>

The main example we are dealing with is a power grid that has a tree-like three-element motif at the periphery. We establish conditions where the addition of a transmission line in the motif enhances its stability or induces Braess’s paradox and reduces stability of the entire grid. By using bifurcation theory and nonlocal stability analysis, we show that two scenarios for Braess’s paradox are realized in the grid. The first scenario is well described and is associated with the disappearance of the synchronous mode. The second scenario has not been previously described and is associated with the reduction of nonlocal stability of the synchronous mode due to the appearance of asynchronous modes. The necessary conditions for stable operation of the grid, under the addition of a line, are derived. It is proved that the new scenario for Braess’s paradox is realized in the grids with more complex topologies even when several lines are added in their bulks.]]></summary>

The way of information diffusion among individuals can be quite complicated, and it is not only limited to one type of communication, but also impacted by multiple channels. Meanwhile, it is easier for an agent to accept an idea once the proportion of their friends who take it goes beyond a specific threshold. Furthermore, in social networks, some higher-order structures, such as simplicial complexes and hypergraph, can describe more abundant and realistic phenomena. Therefore, based on the classical multiplex network model coupling the infectious disease with its relevant information, we propose a novel epidemic model, in which the lower layer represents the physical contact network depicting the epidemic dissemination, while the upper layer stands for the online social network picturing the diffusion of information. In particular, the upper layer is generated by random simplicial complexes, among which the herd-like threshold model is adopted to characterize the information diffusion, and the unaware–aware–unaware model is also considered simultaneously. Using the microscopic Markov chain approach, we analyze the epidemic threshold of the proposed epidemic model and further check the results with numerous Monte Carlo simulations. It is discovered that the threshold model based on the random simplicial complexes network may still cause abrupt transitions on the epidemic threshold. It is also found that simplicial complexes may greatly influence the epidemic size at a steady state.]]></summary>

We study the spreading of renewable power fluctuations through grids with Ohmic losses on the lines. By formulating a network-adapted linear response theory, we find that vulnerability patterns are linked to the left Laplacian eigenvectors of the overdamped eigenmodes. We show that for tree-like networks, fluctuations are amplified in the opposite direction of the power flow. This novel mechanism explains vulnerability patterns that were observed in previous numerical simulations of renewable microgrids. While exact mathematical derivations are only possible for tree-like networks with a homogeneous response, we show that the mechanisms discovered also explain vulnerability patterns in realistic heterogeneous meshed grids by studying the IEEE RTS-1996 test system.]]></summary>

In this paper, analytical predictions of the firing cascades formed by stable and unstable firings in a Hindmarsh–Rose (HR) neuron system are completed via an implicit mapping method. The semi-analytical firing cascades present the route from periodic firings to chaos. For such cascades, the continuous firing flow of the nonlinear neuron system is discretized to form a special mapping structure for nonlinear firing activities. Stability and bifurcation analysis of the nonlinear firings are performed based on resultant eigenvalues of the global mapping structures. Stable and unstable firing solutions in the bifurcation tree exhibit clear period-doubling firing cascades toward chaos. Bifurcations are predicted accurately on the connections. Phase bifurcation trees are observed, which provide deep cognitions of neuronal firings. Harmonic dynamics of the period-doubling firing cascades are obtained and discussed for a better understanding of the contribution of the harmonics in frequency domains. The route into chaos is illustrated by the firing chains from period-1 to period-16 firings and verified by numerical solutions. The applied methods and obtained results provide new perspectives to the complex firing dynamics of the HR neuron system and present a potential strategy to regulate the firings of neurons.]]></summary>

To facilitate the analysis of pattern formation and the related phase transitions in Bose–Einstein condensates, we present an explicit approximate mapping from the nonlocal Gross–Pitaevskii equation with cubic nonlinearity to a phase field crystal (PFC) model. This approximation is valid close to the superfluid–supersolid phase transition boundary. The simplified PFC model permits the exploration of bifurcations and phase transitions via numerical path continuation employing standard software. While revealing the detailed structure of the bifurcations present in the system, we demonstrate the existence of localized states in the PFC approximation. Finally, we discuss how higher-order nonlinearities change the structure of the bifurcation diagram representing the transitions found in the system.]]></summary>

In this paper, we study the network pinning control problem in the presence of two different types of coupling: (i) node-to-node coupling among the network nodes and (ii) input-to-node coupling from the source node to the “pinned nodes.” Previous work has mainly focused on the case that (i) and (ii) are of the same type. We decouple the stability analysis of the target synchronous solution into subproblems of the lowest dimension by using the techniques of simultaneous block diagonalization of matrices. Interestingly, we obtain two different types of blocks, driven and undriven. The overall dimension of the driven blocks is equal to the dimension of an appropriately defined controllable subspace, while all the remaining undriven blocks are scalar. Our main result is a decomposition of the stability problem into four independent sets of equations, which we call quotient controllable, quotient uncontrollable, redundant controllable, and redundant uncontrollable. Our analysis shows that the number and location of the pinned nodes affect the number and the dimension of each set of equations. We also observe that in a large variety of complex networks, the stability of the target synchronous solution is de facto only determined by a single quotient controllable block.]]></summary>

Confronted with the biological problem of managing plasticity in cell populations, which is in particular responsible for transient and reversible drug resistance in cancer, we propose a rationale consisting of an integro-differential and a reaction-advection-diffusion equation, the properties of which are studied theoretically and numerically. By using a constructive finite volume method, we show the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution and illustrate by numerical approximations and their simulations the capacity of the model to exhibit divergence of traits. This feature may be theoretically interpreted as describing a physiological step towards multicellularity in animal evolution and, closer to present-day clinical challenges in oncology, as a possible representation of bet hedging in cancer cell populations.]]></summary>

We revisit the problem of diffusion in a driven system consisting of an inertial Brownian particle moving in a symmetric periodic potential and subjected to a symmetric time-periodic force. We reveal parameter domains in which diffusion is normal in the long time limit and exhibits intriguing giant damped quasiperiodic oscillations as a function of the external driving amplitude. As the mechanism behind this effect, we identify the corresponding oscillations of difference in the number of locked and running trajectories that carry the leading contribution to the diffusion coefficient. Our findings can be verified experimentally in a multitude of physical systems, including colloidal particles, Josephson junction, or cold atoms dwelling in optical lattices, to name only a few.]]></summary>

We evaluate Schelling’s segregation outcomes from the square lattice, regular random networks, and clustered regular random networks by situating them in the probability distribution of the entire outcome space of satisfaction and segregation. To do so, we employ the Wang–Landau algorithm and calculate the entropy and the number of states as a function of satisfaction and segregation. According to the results, satisfaction tends to increase with segregation, irrespective of the network structure. Moreover, segregation occurs almost surely when satisfaction is maximized, which we also algebraically derive and confirm on infinite-size networks. The average ratios of the neighbors of the same tag are about 67% for the square lattice and regular random networks and about 73% for clustered regular random networks with a clustering coefficient of 0.37(1). Thus, clustering increases segregation on regular random networks. Further, we find that Schelling’s path-dependent process generates sharper segregation than expected by random configurations, an outcome symptomatic of over-optimization from the social welfare perspective. Adopting an alternative rule restricting individuals’ choice set may reduce segregation without compromising on satisfaction.]]></summary>

Convective dissolution can occur in porous media when a given solute dissolves in a host layer from above and increases the density of the host solution. Buoyancy-driven fingering can then develop, which increases the transfer flux of the solute. We investigate here numerically the properties of this convective dissolution when the porous host layer is inclined by an angle [math] relative to the horizontal direction. We consider an incompressible flow in porous media governed by Darcy’s law, driven by density gradients associated with the concentration of the dissolving solute. The model problem focuses on the case of a very long (infinite) tilted porous layer limited by two parallel impermeable surfaces. A linear stability analysis and nonlinear simulations are performed using the Boussinesq approximation. A vorticity-stream function formulation is adopted to solve the two-dimensional hydrodynamic field through the finite element method. We find that the inclination of the interface decreases the growth rate of the instability and the range of unstable wavenumbers, delaying or even suppressing the onset of the fingering instability. Moreover, it introduces a drift velocity on the perturbations, which is characterized here in both the linear stability analysis and the nonlinear simulations.]]></summary>

The complex, highly nonlinear dynamic behavior of nuclear reactors can be captured qualitatively by novel four-dimensional (that is, fourth order) and three-dimensional (that is, third order) models of chaotic systems and analyzed with Lyapunov spectra, bifurcation diagrams, and phase diagrams. The chaotic systems exhibit a rich variety of bifurcation phenomena, including the periodic-doubling route to chaos, reverse bifurcations, anti-monotonicity, and merging chaos. The offset boosting method, which relocates the attractor’s basin of attraction in any direction, is demonstrated in these chaotic systems. Both constant parameters and periodic functions are seen in offset boosting phenomena, yielding chaotic attractors with controlled mean values and coexisting attractors.]]></summary>

Our increasing dependence on infrastructure networks leads to growing concerns over the protection of these networks. Many methods have been proposed to select protective strategies by combining complex network theory and game theory. However, the misleading effect of hidden links is not considered in previous methods. This work creates an information gap between attackers and defenders by partly hiding network links to mislead the attacker in the game. We first introduce the rule of link hiding that depends on the nodes’ property, where the number of hidden links has a maximum value. Additionally, based on the Stackelberg game model, we establish an attack–defense game model with link hiding strategies considering node property and cost constraints. Finally, we conduct experiments in a scale-free network and an existing power grid. The experimental results show that the defender tends to combine first-mover advantage and link hiding to get a better payoff under more different costs of the nodes. Hiding half of the links in the existing power grid can effectively reduce network damage by about [math]% on average, with the two sides investing the same resources. The effect of link hiding could be more obvious when the attacker owns more resources than the defender. When an attacker employs the high-degree attacking strategy, the proposed link hiding method can help the defender reduce the damage to the network by 12.2% compared to the link reconnecting method.]]></summary>

One approach to understand the chaotic dynamics of nonlinear dissipative systems is the study of non-chaotic yet dynamically unstable invariant solutions embedded in the system’s chaotic attractor. The significance of zero-dimensional unstable fixed points and one-dimensional unstable periodic orbits capturing time-periodic dynamics is widely accepted for high-dimensional chaotic systems, including fluid turbulence, while higher-dimensional invariant tori representing quasiperiodic dynamics have rarely been considered. We demonstrate that unstable 2-tori are generically embedded in the hyperchaotic attractor of a dissipative system of ordinary differential equations; tori can be numerically identified via bifurcations of unstable periodic orbits and their parameteric continuation and characterization of stability properties are feasible. As higher-dimensional tori are expected to be structurally unstable, 2-tori together with periodic orbits and equilibria form a complete set of relevant invariant solutions on which to base a dynamical description of chaos.]]></summary>

Reservoir computing is a machine learning approach that can generate a surrogate model of a dynamical system. It can learn the underlying dynamical system using fewer trainable parameters and, hence, smaller training data sets than competing approaches. Recently, a simpler formulation, known as next-generation reservoir computing, removed many algorithm metaparameters and identified a well-performing traditional reservoir computer, thus simplifying training even further. Here, we study a particularly challenging problem of learning a dynamical system that has both disparate time scales and multiple co-existing dynamical states (attractors). We compare the next-generation and traditional reservoir computer using metrics quantifying the geometry of the ground-truth and forecasted attractors. For the studied four-dimensional system, the next-generation reservoir computing approach uses [math] less training data, requires [math] shorter “warmup” time, has fewer metaparameters, and has an [math] higher accuracy in predicting the co-existing attractor characteristics in comparison to a traditional reservoir computer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it predicts the basin of attraction with high accuracy. This work lends further support to the superior learning ability of this new machine learning algorithm for dynamical systems.]]></summary>

As a result, the permutation entropy rate can be extended from deterministic dynamics to random processes.

The low-frequency variability of the extratropical atmosphere involves hemispheric-scale recurring, often persistent, states known as teleconnection patterns or regimes, which can have a profound impact on predictability on intra-seasonal and longer timescales. However, reliable data-driven identification and dynamical representation of such states are still challenging problems in modeling the dynamics of the atmosphere. We present a new method, which allows us both to detect recurring regimes of atmospheric variability and to obtain dynamical variables serving as an embedding for these regimes. The method combines two approaches from nonlinear data analysis: partitioning a network of recurrent states with studying its properties by the recurrence quantification analysis and the kernel principal component analysis. We apply the method to study teleconnection patterns in a quasi-geostrophical model of atmospheric circulation over the extratropical hemisphere as well as to reanalysis data of geopotential height anomalies in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere atmosphere in the winter seasons from 1981 to the present. It is shown that the detected regimes as well as the obtained set of dynamical variables explain large-scale weather patterns, which are associated, in particular, with severe winters over Eurasia and North America. The method presented opens prospects for improving empirical modeling and long-term forecasting of large-scale atmospheric circulation regimes.]]></summary>

We study the fractional maps of complex order, [math], for [math] and [math] in one and two dimensions. In two dimensions, we study Hénon, Duffing, and Lozi maps, and in [math], we study logistic, tent, Gauss, circle, and Bernoulli maps. The generalization in [math] can be done in two different ways, which are not equivalent for fractional order and lead to different bifurcation diagrams. We observed that the smooth maps, such as logistic, Gauss, Duffing, and Hénon maps, do not show chaos, while discontinuous maps, such as Bernoulli and circle maps,show chaos. The tent and Lozi map are continuous but not differentiable, and they show chaos as well. In [math], we find that the complex fractional-order maps that show chaos also show multistability. Thus, it can be inferred that the smooth maps of complex fractional order tend to show more regular behavior than the discontinuous or non-differentiable maps.]]></summary>

This paper reports the first finding of cupolets in a chaotic Hindmarsh–Rose neural model. Cupolets (chaotic, unstable, periodic, orbit-lets) are unstable periodic orbits that have been stabilized through a particular control scheme by applying a binary control sequence. We demonstrate different neural dynamics (periodic or chaotic) of the Hindmarsh–Rose model through a bifurcation diagram where the external input current, [math], is the bifurcation parameter. We select a region in the chaotic parameter space and provide the results of numerical simulations. In this chosen parameter space, a control scheme is applied when the trajectory intersects with either of the two control planes. The type of the control is determined by a bit in a binary control sequence. The control is either a small microcontrol (0) or a large macrocontrol (1) that adjusts the future dynamics of the trajectory by a perturbation determined by the coding function [math]. We report the discovery of many cupolets with corresponding control sequences and comment on the differences with previously reported cupolets in the double scroll system. We provide some examples of the generated cupolets and conclude by discussing potential implications for biological neurons.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Data-driven stochastic parameterization methods use observational data to support and improve existing prediction systems. Specifically in atmospheric sciences, uncertainty in observations is a challenge for modeling because several aspects of the physical processes are yet to be understood in some contexts. A key goal in constructing atmospheric models is to express unresolved processes using the resolved variables of a prediction system. Estimating parameterisations for highly nonlinear systems with non stationary data requires application-specific tools. Previous work on methods for analyzing nonstationary data presents a flexible model-based nonparametric clustering methodology that can be exploited for parameterization development. This paper adapts the existing framework for stochastic parameterization by combining the continuous-time formulation of stochastic differential equations (SDE) with the clustering method. We use a closed-form likelihood function approach based on a suitable Hermite expansion to approximate the parameter values of the SDE with arbitrary nonlinear drift and nonlinear diffusion. The novel parameterization framework provides a smooth classification function that allows us to recover the underlying temporal parameter modulation of a nonstationary one-dimensional SDE. The numerical examples show that the clustering approach recovers a hidden functional relationship between the parameters of the SDE model and an additional auxiliary process. The study builds upon this functional relationship to develop closed-form, nonstationary, data-driven stochastic models for multiscale dynamical systems in real-world applications.]]></summary>

This paper applies new and recently introduced approaches to study trends in gun violence in the United States. We use techniques in both the time and frequency domain to provide a more complete understanding of gun violence dynamics. We analyze gun violence incidents on a state-by-state basis as recorded by the Gun Violence Archive. We have numerous specific phenomena of focus, including periodicity of incidents, locations in time where behavioral changes occur, and shifts in gun violence patterns since April 2020. First, we implement a recently introduced method of spectral density estimation for nonstationary time series to investigate periodicity on a state-by-state basis, including revealing where periodic behaviors change with time. We can also classify different patterns of behavioral changes among the states. We then aim to understand the most significant shifts in gun violence since numerous key events in 2020, including the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns, and periods of civil unrest. Our dual-domain analysis provides a more thorough understanding and challenges numerous widely held conceptions regarding the prevalence of gun violence incidents.]]></summary>

We provide a convergence analysis of the localized orthogonal decomposition (LOD) method for Schrödinger equations with general multiscale potentials in the semiclassical regime. We focus on the influence of the semiclassical parameter and the multiscale structure of the potential on the numerical scheme. We construct localized multiscale basis functions by solving a constrained energy minimization problem in the framework of the LOD method. We show that localized multiscale basis functions with a smaller support can be constructed as the semiclassical parameter approaches zero. We obtain the first-order convergence in the energy norm and second-order convergence in the

                     norm for the LOD method and super convergence rates can be obtained if the solution possesses sufficiently high regularity. We analyse the temporal and spatial regularity of the solution and find that the spatial derivatives are more oscillatory than the time derivatives in the presence of a multiscale potential. By combining the regularity analysis, we are able to derive the dependence of the error estimates on the small parameters of the Schrödinger equation. Moreover, we find that the LOD method outperforms the finite element method in the presence of a multiscale potential due to the super convergence for high-regularity solutions and more relaxed dependence of the error estimates on the small parameters for low-regularity solutions. Finally, we present numerical results to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

For numerically solving the high frequency Helmholtz equation, the conventional finite difference and finite element methods based on discretizing the equation on meshes usually suffer from the numerical dispersion errors (‘pollution effect’) that require very refined meshes (Babuska and Sauter in SIAM Rev 42(3):451–484, 2000). Asymptotic methods like geometrical optics provide an alternative way to compute the solutions without ‘pollution effect’, but they generally can only compute locally valid approximations for the solutions and fail to capture the caustics faithfully. In order to obtain globally valid solutions efficiently without ‘pollution effect’, we transfer the problem into a fixed-point problem related to an exponential operator, and the associated functional evaluations are achieved by unconditionally stable operator-splitting based pseudospectral schemes such that large step sizes are allowed to reach the approximated fixed point efficiently for certain prescribed accuracy requirement. And the Anderson acceleration is incorporated to accelerate the convergence. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the method.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We use a general epidemic model, the SEIRS model with a general nonlinear incidence rate, to show how the recently established generic Poincaré–Bendixson theory of flows monotone with respect to a cone of rank 2 can be used to establish the generic convergence to periodic orbits. Our approach to establishing generic convergence to periodic solutions applies to high-dimensional epidemic systems and predator-prey systems, very much like the generic convergence to equilibria in cooperative systems using the classical monotone dynamical systems theory.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Optimal transport, a theory for optimal allocation of resources, is widely used in various fields such as astrophysics, machine learning, and imaging science. However, many applications impose elementwise constraints on the transport plan which traditional optimal transport cannot enforce. Here we introduce supervised optimal transport (sOT), which formulates a constrained optimal transport problem where couplings between certain elements are prohibited according to specific applications. sOT is proved to be equivalent to an [math] penalized optimization problem, from which efficient algorithms are designed to solve its entropy regularized formulation. We demonstrate the capability of sOT by comparing it to other variants and extensions of traditional optimal transport in the color transfer problem. We also study the barycenter problem in sOT formulation, where we discover and prove a unique reverse and portion selection (control) mechanism. Supervised optimal transport is broadly applicable to applications in which a constrained transport plan is involved and the original unit should be preserved by avoiding normalization.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In the online packet scheduling problem with deadlines ([math], for short), the goal is to schedule transmissions of packets that arrive over time in a network switch and need to be sent across a link. Each packet has a deadline, representing its urgency, and a nonnegative weight, which represents its priority. Only one packet can be transmitted in any time slot, so if the system is overloaded, some packets will inevitably miss their deadlines and be dropped. In this scenario, the natural objective is to compute a transmission schedule that maximizes the total weight of packets that are successfully transmitted. The problem is inherently online, with the scheduling decisions made without the knowledge of future packet arrivals. The central problem concerning [math] that has been a subject of intensive study since 2001 is to determine the optimal competitive ratio of online algorithms, namely the worst-case ratio between the optimum total weight of a schedule (computed by an offline algorithm) and the weight of a schedule computed by a (deterministic) online algorithm. We solve this open problem by presenting a [math]-competitive online algorithm for [math] (where [math] is the golden ratio), matching the previously established lower bound.]]></summary>

Almost all epidemic models make the assumption that infection is driven by the interaction between pairs of individuals, one of whom is infectious and the other of whom is susceptible. However, in society individuals mix in groups of varying sizes, at varying times, allowing one or more infectives to be in close contact with one or more susceptible individuals at a given point in time. In this paper we study the effect of mixing groups beyond pairs on the transmission of an infectious disease in an SIR (susceptible

In this paper, a fifth-order finite difference mapped weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme with unequal-size stencils, termed as MUS-WENO, is designed for hyperbolic conservation laws. The new mapping function and nonlinear weights are proposed to reduce the difference between the linear weights and nonlinear weights. It could get smaller numerical errors and obtain fifth-order accuracy, give optimal fifth-order convergence with a tiny

                     even near critical points in smooth regions, and simultaneously suppress spurious oscillations near strong discontinuities. Comparing with the classical fifth-order finite difference WENO schemes and fifth-order finite difference mapped WENO (MWENO) schemes, this mapped WENO scheme uses three unequal-size stencils and the linear weights which can be any positive numbers on condition that their summation is one. Another advantage is that we can reconstruct polynomial over the whole big stencil, while many classical high-order WENO reconstructions only reconstruct the values at the boundary points or discrete quadrature points. Extensive examples including some steady-state problems and some low density, low pressure, or low energy extreme problems are used to testify the good representations of this new MUS-WENO scheme.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We show the possibility of achieving nonreciprocal wave propagation in space-time modulated media and give an asymptotic analysis of the nonreciprocity property in terms of the amplitude of the time modulation. Such modulation causes a folding of the band structure of the material, which may induce degenerate points. By breaking time-reversal symmetry, we show that these degeneracies may open into nonsymmetric, unidirectional band gaps. Finally, we illustrate our results by several numerical simulations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Under the strong exponential-time hypothesis, the diameter of general unweighted graphs cannot be computed in truly subquadratic time (in the size [math] of the input), as shown by Roditty and Williams. Nevertheless there are several graph classes for which this can be done such as bounded-treewidth graphs, interval graphs, and planar graphs, to name a few. We propose to study unweighted graphs of constant distance Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC)-dimension as a broad generalization of many such classes—where the distance VC-dimension of a graph [math] is defined as the VC-dimension of its ball hypergraph whose hyperedges are the balls of all possible radii and centers in [math].

 Abstract. This paper proposes a new general technique for maximal subgraph enumeration which we call proximity search, whose aim is to design efficient enumeration algorithms for problems that could not be solved by existing frameworks. To support this claim and illustrate the technique we include output-polynomial algorithms for several problems for which output-polynomial algorithms were not known, including the enumeration of maximal bipartite subgraphs, maximal [math]-degenerate subgraphs (for bounded [math]), maximal induced chordal subgraphs, and maximal induced trees. Using known techniques, such as reverse search, the space of all maximal solutions induces an implicit directed graph called “solution graph” or “supergraph,” and solutions are enumerated by traversing it; however, nodes in this graph can have exponential out-degree, thus requiring exponential time to be spent on each solution. The novelty of proximity search is a formalization that allows us to define a better solution graph, and a technique, which we call canonical reconstruction, by which we can exploit the properties of given problems to build such graphs. This results in solution graphs whose nodes have significantly smaller (i.e., polynomial) out-degree with respect to existing approaches, but that remain strongly connected, so that all solutions can be enumerated in polynomial delay by a traversal. A drawback of this approach is the space required to keep track of visited solutions, which can be exponential; we further propose a technique to induce a parent-child relationship among solutions and achieve polynomial space when suitable conditions are met.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the following problem: Given a continuous domain [math] along with its convex hull [math], a point [math], and a measure [math] on [math], find the probability density over [math] whose marginal is [math] and that minimizes the KL divergence to the uniform density with respect to [math]. Several distributions in mathematics, physics, statistics, and theoretical computer science arise by different settings of the parameters of this problem. We give a polynomial bound on the norm of the optimizer of the dual problem that holds in a very general setting and relies on a “balance” property of the measure [math] on [math], and exact algorithms for evaluating the dual and its gradient for several interesting settings of [math] and [math]. Together, along with the ellipsoid method, these results imply polynomial-time algorithms to compute such KL divergence minimizing distributions in several cases. Applications of our results include (1) an optimization characterization of the Goemans–Williamson measure [M. X. Goemans and D. P. Williamson, J ACM, 42 (1995), pp. 1115–1145] that is used to round a positive semidefinite matrix to a vector; (2) the computability of the entropic barrier for convex bodies, given a strong integration oracle, studied by [S. Bubeck and R. Eldan, Proc. Mach. Learn. Res. (PMLR), 40 (2015), p. 279], and (3) a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the barycentric quantum entropy of a density matrix that was proposed as an alternative to von Neumann entropy [W. Band and J. L. Park, Found. Phys., 6 (1976), pp. 249–262; J. L. Park and W. Band, Found. Phys., 7 (1977), pp. 233–244; P. B. Slater, Phys. Lett. A, 159 (1991), pp. 411–414]; this corresponds to the case when [math] is the set of rank-one projection matrices and [math] is derived from the Haar measure on the unit sphere.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper considers Bayesian revenue maximization in the [math]-unit setting, where a monopolist seller has [math] copies of an indivisible item and faces [math] unit-demand buyers (whose value distributions can be nonidentical). Four basic mechanisms among others have been widely employed in practice and widely studied in the literature: Myerson auction, sequential posted-pricing, [math]-th price auction with anonymous reserve, and anonymous pricing. Regarding a pair of mechanisms, we investigate the largest possible ratio between the two revenues (also known as the revenue gap), over all possible value distributions of the buyers. Divide these four mechanisms into two groups: (i) the discriminating mechanism group, Myerson auction and sequential posted-pricing, and (ii) the anonymous mechanism group, anonymous reserve and anonymous pricing. Within one group, the involved two mechanisms have an asymptotically tight revenue gap of [math]. In contrast, any two mechanisms from the different groups have an asymptotically tight revenue gap of [math].]]></summary>

In this paper, the dynamics of a single population model with a general growth function is investigated in an advective environment. We show the existence of a nonconstant positive steady state, and give sufficient conditions for the occurrence of a Hopf bifurcation at the positive steady state. Moreover, the theoretical results are applied to the diffusive Nicholson’s blowflies and Mackey–Glass’s models with advection and delay, respectively. We numerically show that the population density decreases as the increase of advection rate or death rate, and a delay-induced Hopf bifurcation is more likely to occur with small advection or low mortality rate.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
By generating transient encounters between individuals beyond their immediate social environment, transport can have a profound impact on the spreading of an epidemic. In this work, we consider epidemic dynamics in the presence of the transport process that gives rise to a multiplex network model. In addition to a static layer, the (multiplex) epidemic network consists of a second dynamic layer in which any two individuals are connected for the time they occupy the same site during a random walk they perform on a separate transport network. We develop a mean-field description of the stochastic network model and study the influence the transport process has on the epidemic threshold. We show that any transport process generally lowers the epidemic threshold because of the additional connections it generates. In contrast, considering also random walks of fractional order that in some sense are a more realistic model of human mobility, we find that these non-local transport dynamics raise the epidemic threshold in comparison to a classical local random walk. We also test our model on a realistic transport network (the Munich U-Bahn network), and carefully compare mean-field solutions with stochastic trajectories in a range of scenarios.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Recently, a golden ratio primal-dual algorithm (GRPDA) was proposed by Chang and Yang for solving structured convex optimization problems. It is a new adaptation of the classical Arrow-Hurwicz method by using a convex combination step, instead of the widely adopted extrapolation technique. The convex combination step is determined by a parameter 
                      
                      \(\psi \)
                      
                    , which, to guarantee global convergence, is restricted to 
                      
                      \((1, (1+\sqrt{5})/2]\)
                      
                    . In this paper, by carrying out a refined analysis, we expand this region to 
                      
                      \((1, 1+\sqrt{3})\)
                      
                    . Moreover, we establish ergodic sublinear convergence rate results based on function value residual and constraint violation of an equivalently reformulated constrained optimization problem, rather than the previously adopted so-called primal-dual gap function that could vanish at nonstationary points. For linear equality constrained and regularized least-squares problems, we further show that GRPDA and Chambolle-Pock’s primal-dual algorithm are equivalent provided that some parameters are chosen properly. Finally, experimental results on the LASSO and the basis pursuit problems are presented to demonstrate the performance of GRPDA with 
                      
                      \(\psi \)

 Abstract. We introduce an end-to-end deep learning architecture called the wide-band butterfly network (WideBNet) for approximating the inverse scattering map from wide-band scattering data. This architecture incorporates tools from computational harmonic analysis, such as the butterfly factorization, and traditional multi-scale methods, such as the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm, to drastically reduce the number of trainable parameters to match the inherent complexity of the problem. As a result, WideBNet is efficient: it requires fewer training points than off-the-shelf architectures and has stable training dynamics which are compatible with standard weight initialization strategies. The architecture automatically adapts to the dimensions of the data with only a few hyper-parameters that the user must specify. WideBNet is able to produce images that are competitive with optimization-based approaches, but at a fraction of the cost, and we also demonstrate numerically that it learns to super-resolve scatterers with a full aperture configuration.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we consider the classical wave equation with time-dependent, spatially multiscale coefficients. We propose a fully discrete computational multiscale method in the spirit of the localized orthogonal decomposition in space with a backward Euler scheme in time. We show optimal convergence rates in space and time beyond the assumptions of spatial periodicity or scale separation of the coefficients. Further, we propose an adaptive update strategy for the time-dependent multiscale basis. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results and showcase the practicability of the adaptive update strategy.]]></summary>

The log-sum penalty is often adopted as a replacement for the 
                      
                      \(\ell _0\)
                      
                     pseudo-norm in compressive sensing and low-rank optimization. The proximity operator of the 
                      
                      \(\ell _0\)
                      
                     penalty, i.e., the hard-thresholding operator, plays an essential role in applications; similarly, we require an efficient method for evaluating the proximity operator of the log-sum penalty. Due to the nonconvexity of this function, its proximity operator is commonly computed through the iteratively reweighted 
                      
                      \(\ell _1\)
                      
                     method, which replaces the log-sum term with its first-order approximation. This paper reports that the proximity operator of the log-sum penalty actually has an explicit expression. With it, we show that the iteratively reweighted 
                      
                      \(\ell _1\)
                      
                     solution disagrees with the true proximity operator in certain regions. As a by-product, the iteratively reweighted 
                      
                      \(\ell _1\)
                      
                     solution is precisely characterized in terms of the chosen initialization. We also give the explicit form of the proximity operator for the composition of the log-sum penalty with the singular value function, as seen in low-rank applications. These results should be useful in the development of efficient and accurate algorithms for optimization problems involving the log-sum penalty. We present applications to solving compressive sensing problems and to mixed additive Gaussian white noise and impulse noise removal.]]></summary>

In this paper, we propose an efficient proper orthogonal decomposition based reduced-order model (POD-ROM) for nonstationary Stokes equations, which combines the classical projection method with POD technique. This new scheme mainly owns two advantages: the first one is low computational costs since the classical projection method decouples the reduced-order velocity variable and reduced-order pressure variable, and POD technique further improves the computational efficiency; the second advantage consists of circumventing the verification of classical LBB/inf-sup condition for mixed reduced spaces with the help of pressure stabilized Petrov–Galerkin (PSPG)-type projection method, where the pressure stabilization term is inherent which allows the use of non inf-sup stable elements without adding extra stabilization terms. We analyze the proposed projection POD-ROM’s stability and convergence, and numerical experiments validate those theoretical results and also the high-efficiency.]]></summary>

Simplified conditions are given for the existence and positivity of wave speed for an integro-difference equation with a strong Allee effect and an unbounded habitat. The results are used to obtain the existence of a critical patch size for an equation with a bounded habitat. It is shown that if the wave speed is positive there exists a critical patch size such that for a habitat size above the critical patch size solutions can persist in space, and if the wave speed is negative solutions always approach zero. An analytical integral formula is developed to determine the critical patch size when the Laplace dispersal kernel is used, and this formula shows existence of multiple equilibrium solutions. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate connections among the wave speed, critical patch size, and Allee threshold.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Atherosclerosis, one of the leading causes of death in USA and worldwide, begins with a lesion in the intima of the arterial wall, allowing LDL to penetrate into the intima where they are oxidized. The immune system considers these oxidized LDL as a dangerous substance and tasks the macrophages to attack them; incapacitated macrophages become foam cells and leads to the formation of a plaque. As the plaque continues to grow, it progressively restricts the blood flow, possibly triggering heart attack or stroke. Because the blood vessels tend to be circular, two-space dimensional cross section model is a good approximation, and the two-space dimensional models are studied in Friedman et al. (J Differ Equ 259(4):1227–1255, 2015) and Zhao and Hu (J Differ Equ 288:250–287, 2021). It is interesting to see whether a true three-space dimensional stationary solution can be developed. We shall establish a three-space dimensional stationary solution for the mathematical model of the initiation and development of atherosclerosis which involves LDL and HDL cholesterols, macrophages and foam cells. The model is a highly nonlinear and coupled system of PDEs with a free boundary, the interface between the plaque and the blood flow. We establish infinite branches of symmetry-breaking stationary solutions which bifurcate from the annular stationary solution in the longitude direction.]]></summary>

Game theory is now routinely applied to quantitatively model the decision making of individuals presented with various voluntary actions that can prevent a given disease. Most models consider only a single preventive strategy and the case where multiple preventative actions are available is severely understudied. In our paper, we consider a very simple SI compartmental model of rabies in the domestic dog population. We study two choices of the dog owners: to vaccinate their dogs or to restrict the movements of unvaccinated dogs. We analyze the relatively rich patterns of Nash equilibria (NE). We show that there is always at least one NE at which the owners utilize only one form of prevention. However, there can be up to three different NEs at the same time: two NEs at which the owners use exclusively only the vaccination or movement restriction, and the third NE when the owners use both forms of prevention simultaneously. However, we also show that, unlike the first two types of NEs, the third kind of NE is not convergent stable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Deriving emergent patterns from models of biological processes is a core concern of mathematical biology. In the context of partial differential equations, these emergent patterns sometimes appear as local minimisers of a corresponding energy functional. Here we give methods for determining the qualitative structure of local minimum energy states of a broad class of multi-species nonlocal advection–diffusion models, recently proposed for modelling the spatial structure of ecosystems. We show that when each pair of species respond to one another in a symmetric fashion (i.e. via mutual avoidance or mutual attraction, with equal strength), the system admits an energy functional that decreases in time and is bounded below. This suggests that the system will eventually reach a local minimum energy steady state, rather than fluctuating in perpetuity. We leverage this energy functional to develop tools, including a novel application of computational algebraic geometry, for making conjectures about the number and qualitative structure of local minimum energy solutions. These conjectures give a guide as to where to look for numerical steady state solutions, which we verify through numerical analysis. Our technique shows that even with two species, multi-stability with up to four classes of local minimum energy states can emerge. The associated dynamics include spatial sorting via aggregation and repulsion both within and between species. The emerging spatial patterns include a mixture of territory-like segregation as well as narrow spike-type solutions. Overall, our study reveals a general picture of rich multi-stability in systems of moving and interacting species.]]></summary>

Of paramount importance in both ecological systems and economic policies are the problems of harvesting of natural resources. A paradigmatic situation where this question is raised is that of fishing strategies. Indeed, overfishing is a well-known problem in the management of live-stocks, as being too greedy may lead to an overall dramatic depletion of the population we are harvesting. A closely related topic is that of Nash equilibria in the context of fishing policies. Namely, two players being in competition for the same pool of resources, is it possible for them to find an equilibrium situation? The goal of this paper is to provide a detailed analysis of these two queries (i.e optimal fishing strategies for single-player models and study of Nash equilibria for multiple players…]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the solution landscape and bifurcation diagrams of nematic liquid crystals confined on a rectangle, using a reduced two-dimensional Landau–de Gennes framework in terms of two geometry-dependent variables: half short edge length [math] and aspect ratio [math]. First, we analytically prove that, for any [math] with a small enough [math] or for a large enough [math] with a fixed domain size, there is a unique stable solution that has two line defects on the opposite short edges. Second, we numerically construct solution landscapes by varying [math] and [math], and report a novel X state, which emerges from saddle-node bifurcation and serves as the parent state in such a solution landscape. Various new classes are then found among these solution landscapes, including the X class, the S class, and the L class. By tracking the Morse indices of individual solutions, we present bifurcation diagrams for nematic equilibria, thus illustrating the emergence mechanism of critical points and several effects of geometrical anisotropy on confined defect patterns.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We deal with bistable reaction-diffusion equations in a domain of a metric graph with two vertices, that is, a domain of multiple half-lines with two junctions connected by a line segment. We prove that there exist two types of standing waves: standing front waves and unimodal waves, if the line segment is long enough. We also numerically show the exact number of standing wave solutions for a cubic nonlinearity and for a piecewise linear case. The stability and instability of the standing wave solutions are also investigated. Standing waves play a role in blocking the front propagation.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Pattern formation arising from the reaction-diffusion epidemic model is a space-time depiction of the distribution and transmission of infectious diseases. Disease control can be achieved by controlling the associated pattern formations. For an SIR reaction-diffusion epidemic model, we review its Turing pattern formations with different transmission rates under the case of a constant recovery rate. To control pattern formations of the SIR epidemic model, we introduce a regulator as a control function of the recovery rate. For a perfect control strategy, it not only leads to a desired pattern formation, but also has a small support in space-time domains. In order to obtain such a control strategy, we propose a sparse optimal control problem governed by the SIR epidemic model. We study the existence of optimal solutions, derive the first order necessary optimality system, obtain the sparsity structure of the control function, and numerically solve the control problem. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectivity of our method.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In mathematical modeling, it is common to have an equation [math], where the exact form of [math] is not known. This article shows that there are large classes of [math] where almost all [math] share the same properties. The classes we investigate are vector spaces [math] of [math] functions [math] that satisfy the following condition: [math] has “almost constant rank" (ACR) if there is a constant integer [math] such that rank[math] for “almost every" [math] and almost every [math]. If the vector space [math] is finite dimensional, then “almost every" is with respect to the Lebesgue measure on [math], and otherwise, it means almost every in the sense of prevalence, as described herein. Most function spaces commonly used for modeling purposes are ACR. In particular, we show that if all of the functions in [math] are linear or polynomial or real analytic, or if [math] is the set of all functions in a “structured system", then [math] is ACR. For each [math] and [math], the solution set of [math] is SolSet[math]. A solution set of [math] is called robust if it persists despite small changes in [math] and [math]. The following two global results are proved for almost every [math] in an ACR vector space [math]: (1) Either the solution set SolSet[math] is robust for almost every [math], or none of the solution sets are robust. (2) The solution set SolSet[math] is a [math]-manifold of dimension [math]. In particular, [math] is the same for almost every [math].]]></summary>

To understand the mechanisms underlying species coexistence, ecologists often study invasion growth rates of theoretical and data-driven models. These growth rates correspond to average per-capita growth rates of one species with respect to an ergodic measure supporting other species. In the ecological literature, coexistence often is equated with the invasion growth rates being positive. Intuitively, positive invasion growth rates ensure that species recover from being rare. To provide a mathematically rigorous framework for this approach, we prove theorems that answer two questions: (i) When do the signs of the invasion growth rates determine coexistence? (ii) When signs are sufficient, which invasion growth rates need to be positive? We focus on deterministic models and equate …]]></summary>

Absolute Concentration Robustness (ACR) was introduced by Shinar and Feinberg (Science 327:1389-1391, 2010) as robustness of equilibrium species concentration in a mass action dynamical system. Their aim was to devise a mathematical condition that will ensure robustness in the function of the biological system being modeled. The robustness of function rests on what we refer to as empirical robustness—the concentration of a species remains unvarying, when measured in the long run, across arbitrary initial conditions. Even simple examples show that the ACR notion introduced in Shinar and Feinberg (Science 327:1389-1391, 2010) (here referred to as static ACR) is neither necessary nor sufficient for empirical robustness. To make a stronger connection with empirical robustness, we define dynamic ACR, a property related to long-term, global dynamics, rather than only to equilibrium behavior. We discuss general dynamical systems with dynamic ACR properties as well as parametrized families of dynamical systems related to reaction networks. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for dynamic ACR in complex balanced reaction networks, a class of networks that is central to the theory of reaction networks.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A matrix basis formulation is introduced to represent the [math] frequency domain dyadic Green’s functions of Maxwell’s equations in 3-dimensional layered media. The formulation can be used to decompose the Maxwell’s Green’s functions into independent TE and TM components, each satisfying a scalar Helmholtz equation. Moreover, the interface transmission conditions for the electromagnetic fields can be reduced to decoupled conditions for the matrix basis coefficients at interfaces. Numerical results for the electric and magnetic dyadic Green’s functions for a 10-layer medium show the capability of the proposed formulation.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we formulate susceptible-infected-susceptible reaction-diffusion epidemic models with cognition and show the impact of movement strategies on disease outbreak and mitigation under a spatially heterogeneous environment. The cognitive diffusion either takes a Fokker–Planck type diffusion obtained by Chapman’s diffusion law (called random diffusion) or follows Fick’s diffusion law (called symmetric diffusion). We derive a variational expression of the basic reproduction number [math] for both models and prove that the disease-free equilibrium is unique and globally asymptotically stable if [math]. Furthermore, if [math], the model following Fick’s diffusion law admits at least one endemic equilibrium and the model following Chapman’s diffusion law has a unique endemic equilibrium. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations, which additionally show the segregation phenomenon between susceptible and infected populations regulated by different movement strategies. Spatial segregation here is natural, not caused by an isolation policy, and thus is the most important indicator for an infectious disease to spread or wane in the absence of intervention. The first example shows that a heterogeneous random diffusion segregates infected and susceptible populations further than an ODE model and thus reduces the infection size. However, symmetric diffusion never does that. The second example shows that a heterogeneous random diffusion detriments segregation but still reduces the infection severity by moving infected individuals to a disease-free region. In a certain situation, a heterogeneous random diffusion may increase the infection severity as shown in the last example.]]></summary>

How to determine the spatial distribution and population dynamics of animals are some of the key questions in ecology. These two have been coupled before, but there is no general method for determining spatial distributions based on instantanous behavior coupled with population dynamics. We propose modeling interacting populations with instantaneous habitat choice through mean-field games. By using the framework of variational inequalities, we are able to determine existence and uniqueness for habitat distributions of interacting populations, in both continuous and discrete habitats. With some additional restrictions, we are also able to show existence and uniqueness of fixed-points of the population dynamics along with spatial distributions. We illustrate our theoretical results by studying a Rosenzweig–MacArthur model where predators and consumers inhabit a continuous habitat. This study is conducted both theoretically and numerically. Analyzing the emergent dynamics is possible as viewing the system from the vantage point of variational inequalities allows for applying efficient numerical methods. The generality of our theoretical approach opens up for studying complex ecosystems, e.g. the impact of enrichment on spatial distributions in marine ecosystems.]]></summary>

External beam radiation therapy is a key part of modern cancer treatments which uses high doses of radiation to destroy tumour cells. Despite its widespread usage and extensive study in theoretical, experimental, and clinical works, many questions still remain about how best to administer it. Many mathematical studies have examined optimal scheduling of radiotherapy, and most come to similar conclusions. Importantly though, these studies generally assume intratumoral homogeneity. But in recent years, it has become clear that tumours are not homogeneous masses of cancerous cells, but wildly heterogeneous masses with various subpopulations which grow and respond to treatment differently. One subpopulation of particular importance is cancer stem cells (CSCs) which are known to exhibi…]]></summary>

Vegetation patterns with a variety of structures is amazing phenomena in arid or semi-arid areas, which can identify the evolution law of vegetation and are typical signals of ecosystem functions. Many achievements have been made in this respect, yet the mechanisms of uptake–diffusion feedback on the pattern structures of vegetation is not fully understood. To well reveal the influences of parameters perturbation on the pattern formation of vegetation, we give a comprehensive analysis on a vegetation–water model in the forms of reaction–diffusion equation which is posed by Zelnik et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci 112:12,327–12,331, 2015). We obtain the exact parameters range for stationary patterns and show the dynamical behaviors near the bifurcation point based on nonlinear analysis. It is found that the model has the properties of spot, labyrinth and gap patterns. Moreover, water diffusion rate prohibits the growth of vegetation while shading parameter promotes the increase of vegetation biomass. Our results show that gradual transitions from uniform state to gap pattern can occur for suitable value of parameters which may induce the emergence of desertification.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We investigate the transfer function emanating from the linearization of a car-following model for human drivers when taking into account their reaction time, which is known to be a cause of the stop-and-go traffic phenomenon. This leads to a nonrational transfer function, implying nontrivial stability conditions which are explicitly given. They are in particular satisfied whenever string stability holds. We also show how this reaction time can introduce a partial string stability, where the transfer function modulus remains smaller than 1 up to some critical frequency. We explore conditions in the parameter space discriminating between 3 different regimes (stability, string stability, and partial string stability).]]></summary>

To study disease transmission with vaccination based on the network, we map an SIR model to a site-bond percolation model. In the case where the vaccination probability is zero, this model degenerates into a bond percolation model without the immunization. Using the method of generation functions, we obtain exact theoretical results for the epidemic threshold and the average outbreak size. From these exact solutions, we find that the epidemic threshold increases while the average outbreak size decreases with vaccination probability. Numerical simulations show that the size of giant component S increases with transmissibility T but decreases with the probability of vaccination. In addition, we compare the epidemic threshold and the size of the giant component for a Poisson network, an exponential network and a power-law network using numerical simulations. When the probability of vaccination is fixed, the epidemic threshold is the smallest for heterogeneous networks and the size of giant component S in homogeneous networks becomes largest for large transmissibility T(T close to 1).]]></summary>
