 Abstract. In this paper we present and analyze a constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method for convection diffusion equations. To define the multiscale basis functions, we first build an auxiliary multiscale space by solving local spectral problems motivated by analysis. Then a constraint energy minimization performed in the oversampling domains is exploited to construct the multiscale space. The resulting multiscale basis functions have a good decay property even for high contrast diffusion and convection coefficients. Furthermore, if the number of oversampling layers is chosen properly, we can prove that the convergence rate is proportional to the coarse meshsize. Our analysis also indicates that the size of the oversampling domain weakly depends on the contrast of the heterogeneous coefficients. Several numerical experiments are presented illustrating the performance of our method.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Malaria is one of the deadliest infectious diseases globally, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. It disproportionately affects young children, with two-thirds of fatalities occurring in under-fives. Individuals acquire protection from disease through repeated exposure, and this immunity plays a crucial role in the dynamics of malaria spread. We develop a novel age-structured PDE malaria model, which couples vector-host epidemiological dynamics with immunity dynamics. Our model tracks the acquisition and loss of antidisease immunity during transmission and its corresponding nonlinear feedback onto the transmission parameters. We derive the basic reproduction number ([math]) as the threshold condition for the stability of disease-free equilibrium; we also interpret [math] probabilistically as a weighted sum of cases generated by infected individuals at different infectious stages and different ages. We parametrize our model using demographic and immunological data from sub-Saharan regions. Numerical bifurcation analysis demonstrates the existence of an endemic equilibrium, and we observe a forward bifurcation in [math]. Our numerical simulations reproduce the heterogeneity in the age distributions of immunity profiles and infection status created by frequent exposure. Motivated by the recently approved RTS,S vaccine, we also study the impact of vaccination; our results show a reduction in severe disease among young children but a small increase in severe malaria among older children due to lower acquired immunity from delayed exposure.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study exact algorithms for Metric TSP in [math]. In the early 1990s, algorithms with [math] running time were presented for the planar case, and some years later an algorithm with [math] running time was presented for any [math]. Despite significant interest in subexponential exact algorithms over the past decade, there has been no progress on Metric TSP, except for a lower bound stating that the problem admits no [math] algorithm unless ETH fails. In this paper we settle the complexity of Metric TSP, up to constant factors in the exponent and under ETH, by giving an algorithm with running time [math].]]></summary>

A divide-and-conquer solver coupled with Tensor-Train (TT) format is proposed for solving the d-dimensional time-space fractional diffusion equations with alternating direction implicit finite difference scheme. In contrast to the complexity and storage of divide-and-conquer solver in full storage format, which grows at least exponentially with dimension d, complexity and storage of the proposed solver are 
                      
                      \(\mathcal {O}\left( NM\left( \log M+r\right) \left( r+(d-1)r^2\right) \right. \)

                     with acceleration by an efficient approximated Toeplitz inversion, where M, N are numbers of spatial and temporal grid points and r is the TT-ranks of related TT format data. Hence they grow slowly with dimension d if the TT-ranks r is low. For reducing the increase of TT-ranks after certain TT operations, TT rounding is performed with introduced error, which is analyzed for giving a criterion for preserving convergence rate of the numerical scheme. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed solver is illustrated by numerical experiments with dimension d up to 20 for case of low TT-ranks initial conditions and source terms.]]></summary>

This work addresses model order reduction for complex moving fronts, which are transported by advection or through a reaction–diffusion process. Such systems are especially challenging for model order reduction since the transport cannot be captured by linear reduction methods. Moreover, topological changes, such as splitting or merging of fronts pose difficulties for many nonlinear reduction methods and the small non-vanishing support of the underlying partial differential equations dynamics makes most nonlinear hyper-reduction methods infeasible. We propose a new decomposition method together with a hyper-reduction scheme that addresses these shortcomings. The decomposition uses a level-set function to parameterize the transport and a nonlinear activation function that captures the structure of the front. This approach is similar to autoencoder artificial neural networks, but additionally provides insights into the system, which can be used for efficient reduced order models. In addition to the presented decomposition method, we outline a tailored hyper-reduction method that is based on the reduced integration domain method. The capability of the approach is illustrated by various numerical examples in one and two spatial dimensions, including an advection–reaction–diffusion system with a Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov reaction term and real life application to a two-dimensional Bunsen flame.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We introduce the first two-way coupled model for the thermo-viscous damping of a mechanical structure (such as quartz tuning fork) that is forced by the weak acoustic and thermal waves generated when a laser source periodically interacts with a trace gas. The model is based on a Helmholtz system of thermo-visco-acoustic equations in the fluid, together with a system of equations for the temperature and the displacement of the structure. These two subsystems are coupled across the fluid-structure interface via several conditions. With this model, the user specifies the geometry of the structure and the viscous and thermal parameters of the fluid, and the model outputs an effective damping parameter and a signal strength that is proportional to the concentration of the trace gas. This new model is a significant improvement over existing one-way coupled models in which damping effects are incorporated via a priori laboratory measurements. Analytical solutions derived for an annular structure show reasonable agreement between the one-way and two-way coupled models at higher ambient pressures. However, at low ambient pressure the one-way coupled model does not adequately capture thermo-viscous effects.]]></summary>

Stokes flow equations have been implemented successfully in practice for simulating problems with moving interfaces. Though computational methods based on the well-known MAC scheme produce accurate solutions and numerical convergence can be demonstrated using a resolution study, the rigorous convergence proofs are usually limited to particular reformulations and boundary conditions. In this paper, a rigorous error analysis of the marker and cell scheme for Stokes interface problems with constant viscosity in the framework of the finite difference method is presented. Without reformulating the problem into elliptic PDEs, the main idea is to use a discrete Ladyzenskaja-Babuska-Brezzi condition and construct auxiliary functions, which satisfy discretized Stokes equations and possess at least second order accuracy in the neighborhood of the moving interface. In particular, the method, for the first time, enables one to prove second order convergence of the velocity gradient in the discrete

 Abstract. We propose a neural network-based approach to the homogenization of multiscale problems. The proposed method uses a derivative-free formulation of a training loss, which incorporates Brownian walkers to find the macroscopic description of a multiscale PDE solution. Compared with other network-based approaches for multiscale problems, the proposed method is free from the design of hand-crafted neural network architecture and the cell problem to calculate the homogenization coefficient. The exploration neighborhood of the Brownian walkers affects the overall learning trajectory. We determine the bounds of micro- and macro-time steps that capture the local heterogeneous and global homogeneous solution behaviors, respectively, through a neural network. The bounds imply that the computational cost of the proposed method is independent of the microscale periodic structure for the standard periodic problems. We validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method through a suite of linear and nonlinear multiscale problems with periodic and random field coefficients.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The scaling of the mobility of two-dimensional Langevin dynamics in a periodic potential as the friction vanishes is not well understood for nonseparable potentials. Theoretical results are lacking, and numerical calculation of the mobility in the underdamped regime is challenging because the computational cost of standard Monte Carlo methods is inversely proportional to the friction coefficient, while deterministic methods are ill-conditioned. In this work, we propose a new variance-reduction method based on control variates for efficiently estimating the mobility of Langevin-type dynamics. We provide bounds on the bias and variance of the proposed estimator and illustrate its efficacy through numerical experiments, first in simple one-dimensional settings and then for two-dimensional Langevin dynamics. Our results corroborate prior numerical evidence that the mobility scales as [math], with [math], in the low friction regime for a simple nonseparable potential.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansions are a powerful tool for studying differential equations with random coefficients, allowing, in particular, one to efficiently approximate random invariant sets associated with such equations. In this work, we use ideas from validated numerics in order to obtain rigorous a posteriori error estimates together with existence results about gPC expansions of random invariant sets. This approach also provides a new framework for conducting validated continuation, i.e., for rigorously computing isolated branches of solutions in parameter-dependent systems, which generalizes in a straightforward way to multiparameter continuation. We illustrate the proposed methodology by rigorously computing random invariant periodic orbits in the Lorenz system, as well as branches and 2 dimensional manifolds of steady states of the Swift–Hohenberg equation.]]></summary>

We then present and investigate numerically a Bayesian framework for the inference of the source trajectory and intensity from wave field measurements.

 Abstract. We consider the Max-Cut problem. Let [math] be a graph with adjacency matrix [math]. Burer, Monteiro, and Zhang proposed to find, for [math] angles [math], minima of the energy [math]. Configurations achieving a global minimum leads to a partition of size at least [math]. This approach is known to be computationally viable and leads to very good results in practice. We prove, for each [math], that replacing [math] with an explicit [math] global minima lead to a partition of size at least [math]. This suggests some interesting algorithms that perform well. It also shows that the problem of finding approximate global minima of energy functionals of this type is NP-hard, in general.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Hip-hop solutions of the [math]-body problem are solutions that satisfy, at every instance of time, that the [math] bodies with the same mass [math] are at the vertices of two regular [math]-gons, and each one of these [math]-gons is at a plane that are equidistant from a fixed plane [math] forming an antiprism. In this paper, we first prove that for every [math] and every [math] there exists a family of periodic hip-hop solutions. For every solution in these families the oriented distance to the plane [math], which we call [math], is an odd function that is also even with respect to [math] for some [math]. For this reason we call solutions in these families double symmetric solutions. By exploring more carefully our initial set of periodic solutions, we numerically show that some of the branches established in our existence theorem have bifurcations that produce branches of solutions with the property that the oriented distance function [math] is not even with respect to any [math]; we call these solutions single symmetric solutions. We prove that no single symmetric solution is a choreography. We also display explicit double symmetric solutions that are choreographies.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we take the Rosenzweig–MacArthur (RM) model with generalist predator as an example in a constant or changing environment. When the environment is fixed, we provide a more easily verifiable classification, in terms of the coefficients of the system with nilpotent linear part and general higher terms, to determine the types and codimension of nilpotent singularities in a general planar system. Second, by using the existing classification and some algebraic methods, we show that the highest codimension of a nilpotent focus is 4 and the sample RM model with generalist predator can exhibit nilpotent focus bifurcation of codimension 4. Our results indicate that generalist predation can cause not only richer bifurcations and dynamics (such as multitype tristability and quadristability, a figure-eight loop) but also the possible extirpation of prey. When the environment is changing, we study the impact of the rate [math] and intensity [math] of a nonlinear environmental change on dynamics. The key observations on the asymptotic and transient dynamics include (i) transient tracking on unstable steady states or oscillations, and transient-related regime shifts; (ii) slow and fast regime shifts; (iii) regulation of transient dynamics by the environmental change parameters [math] and [math]; (iv) slow negative or fast positive environmental change can delay or even avoid population extirpation.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Long-term behaviors of biochemical systems are described by steady states in deterministic models and stationary distributions in stochastic models. Obtaining their analytic solutions can be done for limited cases, such as linear or finite-state systems, as it generally requires solving many coupled equations. Interestingly, analytic solutions can be easily obtained when underlying networks have special topologies, called weak reversibility (WR) and zero deficiency (ZD), and the kinetic law follows a generalized form of mass-action kinetics. However, such desired topological conditions do not hold for the majority of cases. Thus, translating networks to have WR and ZD while preserving the original dynamics was proposed. Yet, this approach is limited because manually obtaining the desired network translation among the large number of candidates is challenging. Here, we prove necessary conditions for having WR and ZD after translation, and based on these conditions, we develop a user-friendly computational package, TOWARDZ, that automatically and efficiently identifies translated networks with WR and ZD. This allows us to quantitatively examine how likely it is to obtain WR and ZD after translation depending on the number of species and reactions. Importantly, we also describe how our package can be used to analytically derive steady states of deterministic models and stationary distributions of stochastic models. TOWARDZ provides an effective tool to analyze biochemical systems.]]></summary>

Approximate multidimensional Riemann solvers are essential building blocks in designing globally constraint-preserving finite volume time domain and discontinuous Galerkin time domain schemes for computational electrodynamics (CED). In those schemes, we can achieve high-order temporal accuracy with the help of Runge–Kutta or ADER time-stepping. This paper presents the design of a multidimensional approximate generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solver for the first time. The multidimensional Riemann solver accepts as its inputs the four states surrounding an edge on a structured mesh, and its output consists of a resolved state and its associated fluxes. In contrast, the multidimensional GRP solver accepts as its inputs the four states and their gradients in all directions; its output consists of the resolved state and its corresponding fluxes and the gradients of the resolved state. The gradients can then be used to extend the solution in time. As a result, we achieve second-order temporal accuracy in a single step. In this work, the formulation is optimized for linear hyperbolic systems with stiff, linear source terms because such a formulation will find maximal use in CED. Our formulation produces an overall constraint-preserving time-stepping strategy based on the GRP that is provably L-stable in the presence of stiff source terms. We present several stringent test problems, showing that the multidimensional GRP solver for CED meets its design accuracy and performs stably with optimal time steps. The test problems include cases with high conductivity, showing that the beneficial L-stability is indeed realized in practical applications.]]></summary>

Semi-Lagrangian schemes for the discretization of the dynamic programming principle are based on a time discretization projected on a state-space grid. The use of a structured grid makes this approach not feasible for high-dimensional problems due to the curse of dimensionality. Here, we present a new approach for infinite horizon optimal control problems where the value function is computed using radial basis functions by the Shepard moving least squares approximation method on scattered grids. We propose a new method to generate a scattered mesh driven by the dynamics and the selection of the shape parameter in the RBF using an optimization routine. This mesh will help to localize the problem and approximate the dynamic programming principle in high dimension. Error estimates for the value function are also provided. Numerical tests for high dimensional problems will show the effectiveness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

This paper is concerned with the numerical solution of compressible fluid flow in a fractured porous medium. The fracture represents a fast pathway (i.e., with high permeability) and is modeled as a hypersurface embedded in the porous medium. We aim to develop fast-convergent and accurate global-in-time domain decomposition (DD) methods for such a reduced fracture model, in which smaller time step sizes in the fracture can be coupled with larger time step sizes in the subdomains. Using the pressure continuity equation and the tangential PDEs in the fracture-interface as transmission conditions, three different DD formulations are derived; each method leads to a space-time interface problem which is solved iteratively and globally in time. Efficient preconditioners are designed to accelerate the convergence of the iterative methods while preserving the accuracy in time with nonconforming grids. Numerical results for two-dimensional problems with non-immersed and partially immersed fractures are presented to show the improved performance of the proposed methods.]]></summary>

In this paper, we propose a conforming virtual element method based on an unfitted mesh to solve the elliptic interface problem in two dimensions. The intersecting points of the interface and the edges of triangles are considered as additional nodes of the mesh. Thus each interface triangle is regarded as a polygon with more than three vertices. On each interface polygon, we introduce a virtual element satisfying the interface conditions. On each non-interface triangle, we use the usual linear element. Based on a computable projection-like operator, we introduce our discrete scheme. Both the approximation and consistency errors are analyzed rigorously and all the hidden constants do not depend on how the interface intersects with the meshes. The error between the exact and discrete solution is shown to decrease linear with regard to the mesh size. Some numerical experiments are provided to verify the theoretical results.]]></summary>

Precisely, we show that the sequence generated by our iterative process converges strongly to a common element for the solution set of variational inequality problems and the set of fixed points of Bregman relatively nonexpansive mappings. Additionally, some numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of our algorithm. The results obtained in this paper are the improvement and supplement of many recent ones in the field.]]></summary>

The goal of this paper is to provide almost robust approximations of singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion equations in two dimensions by using finite elements on graded meshes. When the mesh grading parameter is appropriately chosen, we obtain quasioptimal error estimations in a balanced norm for piecewise bilinear elements, by using a weighted variational formulation of the problem introduced by N. Madden and M. Stynes, Calcolo 58(2) 2021. We also prove a supercloseness result, namely, that the difference between the finite element solution and the Lagrange interpolation of the exact solution, in the weighted balanced norm, is of higher order than the error itself. We finish the work with numerical examples which show the good performance of our approach.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
In this paper new explicit integrators for numerical solution of stiff evolution equations are proposed. As shown by Bassenne, Fu and Mani in (J Comput Phys 424:109847, 2021), the action on the original vector field of the stiff equations of an appropriate time-accurate and highly-stable explicit (TASE) linear operator, allows us to use explicit Runge–Kutta (RK) schemes with these modified equations so that the resulting algorithm becomes stable for the original stiff equations. Here a new family of TASE operators is considered. The new operators, called Singly TASE, have the advantage over the TASE operators of Bassenne et al. that the action on the vector field depends on the powers of the inverse of only one matrix, which can be computationally more simple, without loosing stability properties. A complete study of the linear stability properties of k–stage, kth–order explicit RK schemes under the action of Singly TASE operators of the same order is carried out for 
                      
                      \(k \le 4\)
                      
                    . For orders two, three and four, particular schemes that are nearly strongly A–stable and therefore suitable for stiff problems are devised. Further, explicit RK schemes with orders three and four that can be implemented with only two storage locations under the action of Singly TASE operators of the same order are discussed. A particular implementation of the classical four–stage fourth–order RK scheme with two Singly TASE operators is presented. A set of numerical experiments has been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the new schemes by comparing with previous RKTASE and other established methods. The main conclusion is that the new integrators provide a very simple solver for stiff systems with good stability properties and avoids the difficulties of using implicit algorithms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Getting an efficient neural network can be a very difficult task for engineers and researchers because of the huge number of hyperparameters to tune and their interconnections. To make the tuning step easier and more understandable, this work focuses on probably one of the most important leverage to improve Neural Networks efficiency: the optimizer. These recent years, a great number of algorithms have been developed but they need an accurate tuning to be efficient. To get rid of this long and experimental step, we are looking for generic and desirable properties for non-convex optimization. For this purpose, the optimizers are reinterpreted or analyzed as a discretization of a continuous dynamical system. This continuous framework offers many mathematical tools in order to interpret the sensitivity of the optimizer with respect to the initial guess such as Lyapunov stability. By enforcing the discrete decrease of Lyapunov functionals, new robust and efficient optimizers are designed. They also considerably simplify the tuning of hyperparameters (learning rate, momentum etc.). These Lyapunov based algorithms outperform several state of the art optimizers on different benchmarks of the literature. Drawing its inspiration from the numerical analysis of PDEs, this paper emphasizes the essential role of some hidden energy/entropy quantities for machine learning tasks.]]></summary>

In this paper, we study least-squares finite element methods (LSFEM) for general second-order elliptic equations with nonconforming finite element approximations. The equation may be indefinite. For the two-field potential-flux div LSFEM with Crouzeix–Raviart (CR) element approximation, we present three proofs of the discrete solvability under the condition that mesh size is small enough. One of the proof is based on the coerciveness of the original bilinear form. The other two are based on the minimal assumption of the uniqueness of the solution of the second-order elliptic equation. A counterexample shows that div least-squares functional does not have norm equivalence in the sum space of 
                      
                      \(H^1\)
                      
                     and CR finite element spaces. Thus it cannot be used as an a posteriori error estimator. Several versions of reliable and efficient error estimators are proposed for the method. We also propose a three-filed potential-flux-intensity div-curl least-squares method with general nonconforming finite element approximations. The norm equivalence in the abstract nonconforming piecewise 
                      
                      \(H^1\)
                      
                    -space is established for the three-filed formulation on the minimal assumption of the uniqueness of the solution of the second-order elliptic equation. The three-filed div-curl nonconforming formulation thus has no restriction on the mesh size, and the least-squares functional can be used as the built-in a posteriori error estimator. Under some restrictive conditions, we also discuss a potential-flux div-curl least-squares method.]]></summary>

 Abstract. At the macroscopic scale, many important models of collective motion fall into the class of kinematic flows for which both velocity and diffusion terms depend only on particle density. When total particle numbers are fixed and finite, simulations of corresponding microscopic dynamics exhibit stochastic effects which can induce a variety of interesting behaviors not present in the large system limit. In this article we undertake a systematic examination of finite-size fluctuations in a general class of particle models whose statistics correspond to those of stochastic kinematic flows. Doing so, we are able to characterize phenomena including quasi-jams in models of traffic flow; stochastic pattern formation among spatially coupled oscillators; anomalous bulk subdiffusion in porous media; and travelling wave fluctuations in a model of bacterial swarming.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The chase procedure is a fundamental algorithmic tool in database theory with a variety of applications. A central problem concerning the chase procedure is uniform (a.k.a. all-instances) chase termination: for a given set of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs), is it the case that the chase terminates for every input database? In view of the fact that this problem is, in general, undecidable, it is natural to ask whether known well-behaved classes of TGDs ensure decidability. We focus on the main paradigms that led to robust TGD-based formalisms, namely guardedness and stickiness, that have been introduced in the context of knowledge-enriched databases. Although uniform chase termination is well understood for the oblivious version of the chase (2EXPTIME-complete for guarded, and PSPACE-complete for sticky TGDs), the more subtle case of the restricted (a.k.a. the standard) chase is rather unexplored. We show that uniform restricted chase termination under guarded single-head TGDs and sticky single-head TGDs is decidable in elementary time. In the case of guardedness, we provide a reduction to the satisfiability problem of monadic second-order logic over infinite trees of bounded degree, while for stickiness we provide a reduction to the emptiness problem of deterministic Büchi automata. Those reductions build on a series of technical results of independent interest related to the notion of fairness of the restricted chase, and the existence of critical databases that characterize nontermination of the restricted chase via databases of a certain form.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper we take a combinatorial approach to the problem of list-decoding, which allows us to determine the precise relation (up to the exact constant) between the decoding radius, list size, and code rate. We prove a generalized Singleton bound for a given list size, and conjecture that the bound is tight for most Reed–Solomon (RS) codes over large enough finite fields. We also show that the conjecture holds true for list sizes 2 and 3, and as a by product show that most RS codes with a rate of at least 1/9 are list-decodable beyond the Johnson radius. Last, we give the first explicit construction in the literature of such RS codes. The main tools used in the proof are a new type of linear dependency between codewords of a code that are contained in a small Hamming ball, and a surprising connection between list-decoding and the notion of cycle space in graph theory. Both of them are new, and may be of independent interest.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The basic goal of survivable network design is to build a cheap network that maintains the connectivity between given sets of nodes despite the failure of a few edges/nodes. The connectivity augmentation problem ([math]) is arguably one of the most basic problems in this area: given a [math](-edge)-connected graph [math] and a set of extra edges (links), select a minimum cardinality subset [math] of links such that adding [math] to [math] increases its edge connectivity to [math]. Intuitively, one wants to make an existing network more reliable by augmenting it with extra edges. The best known approximation factor for this NP-hard problem is 2, and this can be achieved with multiple approaches (the first su…]]></summary>

Moreover, an algorithm allowing shape and topological changes is proposed by a phase-field method with sensitivity analysis.

An extended range of energy stable flux reconstruction schemes, developed using a summation-by-parts approach, is presented on quadrilateral elements for various sets of polynomial bases. For the maximal order bases, a new set of correction functions which result in stable schemes is found. However, for a range of orders it is shown that only a single correction function can be cast as a tensor-product. Subsequently, correction functions are identified using a generalised analytic framework that results in stable schemes for total order and approximate Euclidean order polynomial bases on quadrilaterals—which have not previously been explored in the context of flux reconstruction. It is shown that the approximate Euclidean order basis can provide similar numerical accuracy as the maximal order basis but with fewer points per element, and thus lower cost.]]></summary>

The aim of this work is to apply a semi-implicit (SI) strategy in an implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge–Kutta (RK) setting introduced in Boscarino et al. (J Sci Comput 68:975–1001, 2016) to a sequence of 1D time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) with high order spatial derivatives. This strategy gives a great flexibility to treat these equations, and allows the construction of simple linearly implicit schemes without any Newton’s iteration. Furthermore, the SI IMEX-RK schemes so designed does not need any severe time step restriction that usually one has using explicit methods for the stability, i.e. 
                      
                      \(\Delta t = {\mathcal {O}}(\Delta t^k)\)

                    ) order PDEs. For the space discretization, this strategy is combined with finite difference schemes. We illustrate the effectiveness of the schemes with many applications to dissipative, dispersive and biharmonic-type equations. Numerical experiments show that the proposed schemes are stable and can achieve optimal orders of accuracy.]]></summary>
