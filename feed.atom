 Abstract. We study traveling wave solutions to bistable differential equations on infinite k-ary trees. These graphs generalize the notion of classical square infinite lattices and our results complement those for bistable lattice equations on [math]. Using comparison principles and explicit lower and upper solutions, we show that wave solutions are pinned for small diffusion parameters. Upon increasing the diffusion, the wave starts to travel with nonzero speed, in a direction that depends on the detuning parameter. However, once the diffusion is sufficiently strong, the wave propagates in a single direction up the tree irrespective of the detuning parameter. In particular, our results imply that changes to the diffusion parameter can lead to a reversal of the propagation direction.]]></summary>

This work focuses on the robust and high-order numerical simulations of weakly compressible two-phase flows by using the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method combined with an explicit strong-stability-preserving Runge–Kutta scheme. In order to improve the computational robustness under large density ratios, a nonlinear weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) limiter and a positivity-preserving limiter are specially designed and applied with the aim of dampening the nonphysical oscillations around the phase interface and preventing the occurrence of negative density, respectively. More importantly, we theoretically prove that the present method is able to satisfy the uniform-pressure–velocity criterion which states that uniform pressure and velocity profiles around an isolated phase interface should be preserved during the simulation. The performance of the present method is validated by a range of benchmark test cases with density ratios up to 1000:1. The results demonstrate that the present method possesses a good capability of simulating weakly compressible two-phase flows with large density ratios.]]></summary>

In this paper, a hybrid Hermite weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme is proposed for nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations which may contain discontinuity in the solution. The present scheme is constructed by applying the hybrid HWENO method based on the zero- and first-order moment with DDG flux to discrete the diffusion term in spatial direction and the third-order TVD Runge–Kutta method in temporal direction. A troubled-cell indicator is first used to identify the cells in which the discontinuity may exist, then the first-order moment in the troubled-cell is reconstructed by fifth-order HWENO scheme. To avoid spurious oscillation, the HWENO reconstruction is performed when the reconstruction stencils contain troubled-cell, otherwise linear reconstruction is performed straightforwardly. Compared with WENO schemes, the present scheme has advantages: (1) compactness, only immediate neighbor cells are used in the reconstruction procedure; (2) accuracy, the numerical errors by the present scheme are smaller than those by WENO schemes. Some benchmarks for one- and two-dimensional parabolic equations to demonstrate the high order accuracy and non-oscillatory performance of the present scheme.]]></summary>

This paper introduces a new sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm that jointly recovers a temporal sequence of edge maps from noisy and under-sampled Fourier data. The new method is cast in a Bayesian framework and uses a prior that simultaneously incorporates intra-image information to promote sparsity in each individual edge map with inter-image information to promote similarities in any unchanged regions. By treating both the edges as well as the similarity between adjacent images as random variables, there is no need to separately form regions of change. Thus we avoid both additional computational cost as well as any information loss resulting from pre-processing the image. Our numerical examples demonstrate that our new method compares favorably with more standard SBL approaches.]]></summary>

We propose and study a method for finding quasi-resonances for a linear acoustic transmission problem in frequency domain. Starting from an equivalent boundary-integral equation we perform Galerkin boundary element discretization and look for the minima of the smallest singular value of the resulting matrix as a function of the wave number k. We develop error estimates for the impact of Galerkin discretization on singular values and devise a heuristic adaptive algorithm for finding the minima in prescribed k-intervals. Our method exclusively relies on the solution of eigenvalue problems for real k, in contrast to alternative approaches that rely on extension to the complex plane.]]></summary>

At each time step, all variables can be computed independently by solving a sequence of linear finite element schemes and algebraic equations.

 Abstract. The overexploitation of natural resources by our industrial society questions its long-term sustainability. Recently, a simple nature-society interrelation model, called the HANDY (Human And Nature DYnamics) model, has been proposed by Motesharrei, Rivas, and Kalnay [Ecol. Econ., 101 (2014), pp. 90–102] to address this concern with a special emphasis on the role of the stratification of the society. In this paper we analyze the dynamics of this model, and we explore the influence of two parameters: the nature depletion rate and the inequality factor. We characterize the asymptotic states of the system through a bifurcation analysis, and we derive several quantitative predictions. We show that some collapses are irreversible and, depending on the wealth production factor, bistability regimes can be obtained. In particular, a sustainable equilibrium can coexist with cycles of prosperity and collapse. We discuss the possible policies to prevent undesirable fates.]]></summary>

 Abstract. As a model to provide a hands-on, elementary understanding of chaotic dynamics in dimension 3, we introduce a [math]-open set of diffeomorphisms of [math] having two horseshoes with different dimensions of instability. We prove that the unstable set of one horseshoe and the stable set of the other are of Hausdorff dimension nearly 2 whose cross sections are Cantor sets and that the intersection of the unstable and stable sets contains a fractal set of Hausdorff dimension nearly 1. As a corollary we detect [math]-robust heterodimensional cycles. Our proof employs the theory of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds and the thicknesses of Cantor sets.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This work is concerned with the Dirac points for the honeycomb lattice with impenetrable obstacles arranged periodically in a homogeneous medium. We consider both the Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalue problems and prove the existence of Dirac points for both eigenvalue problems at crossing of the lower band surfaces as well as higher band surfaces. Furthermore, we perform quantitative analyses for the eigenvalues and the slopes of two conical dispersion surfaces near each Dirac point based on a combination of the layer potential technique and asymptotic analysis. It is shown that the eigenvalues are in the neighborhood of the singular frequencies associated with the Green’s function for the honeycomb lattice, and the slopes of the dispersion surfaces are reciprocal to the eigenvalues.]]></summary>

In this paper, a new limiter namely the compact weighted biased average procedure (CWBAP) is proposed for the shock capturing of high-order finite volume methods on unstructured girds. The new feature of this limiter is that all its operations are based on the information within a compact stencil. This limiter is an improvement of the original weighted biased average procedure (WBAP) which is not compact due to its successive limiting feature when applied to high-order schemes. This improvement mainly relies on two new techniques: a successive secondary reconstruction and a two-step WBAP limiter. The new limiter can preserve the original order of accuracy of the high-order finite volume schemes when simulating smooth flow without shock waves, and it shows improvements in accuracy, resolution and convergence property over the original WBAP limiter according to the numerical results of a number of test cases. Furthermore, the compactness of this limiter reduces the amount of data transfer in parallel computing. When implemented into the newly developed high-order finite volume schemes based on the compact stencil, the efficiency of the parallel computing can be effectively improved.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The influence of multiplicative stochastic perturbations on the class of asymptotically Hamiltonian systems on the plane is investigated. It is assumed that disturbances do not preserve the equilibrium of the corresponding limiting system, and their intensity decays in time with power-law asymptotics. The paper discusses the long-term asymptotic behavior of solutions and its dependence on the structure and parameters of perturbations. In particular, it is shown that perturbed trajectories can tend to the equilibrium of the limiting system or that new stochastically stable states can arise. The proposed analysis is based on a combination of the averaging method and the construction of stochastic Lyapunov functions. The results obtained are applied to the problem of capture into parametric autoresonance in the presence of noise.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Biological systems are known to be inherently uncertain and complex, and it is often difficult to justify rigorously functional forms used in a mathematical model. Generally, one chooses some simple function having qualitatively correct behavior without concern for the precise choice of function; the assumption has been that qualitatively similar functions will produce qualitatively similar behavior from the model. However, it has been shown that, in some cases, the qualitative predictions from a model are sensitive to the particular functional form used; this property is known as structural sensitivity. A promising tool for quantification of structural sensitivity is the use of partially specified models, in which some number of functions in equations are not defined explicitly. However, in this approach we cannot rely on the traditional parameter-based framework, where all functional forms are well defined but contain parameters to be determined. The main difficulties are that, mathematically, we need to deal with an infinite-dimensional function space and that a well-defined measure on that space is needed. We propose a novel framework to reveal the structural sensitivity and quantify uncertainty in partially specified biological models based on ordinary differential equations backed up by empirical data. Our method uses path integration, previously introduced in theoretical physics. As an insightful example, we explore structural sensitivity of a well-known tritrophic food chain model in which the functional response of the predator is uncertain, using available experimental data on protozoan predation on bacteria. For the mentioned model, we compare the novel framework with the classical methods of parameter-based sensitivity analysis and demonstrate distinct outcomes for the two approaches. Finally, we discuss a further extension of the proposed framework.]]></summary>

Restoring natural images corrupted by Cauchy noise is a challenging issue in image processing. In the existing methods, the traditional model-driven and filter-based methods can not recover the images well, and the learning-based plug-and-play method lacks convergence guarantees. In this paper, we propose a convergent plug-and-play method with outliers detection (C-PnPO) to remove Cauchy noise. The outlier detection is based on an outlier map regularized by maximum entropy. Due to the statistical properties of Cauchy distribution and the implicit deep image priors, the problem is non-convex and implicit. We present a convergent algorithm to address these issues by an adaptively relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers. Theoretically, we give some useful mathematical properties, including the existence of solutions under mild assumptions, and the global linear convergence of the proposed method by an adaptive relaxation strategy. Experimental results show that the outliers can be successfully detected, and the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-art traditional and learning-based methods both in terms of quantitative and qualitative comparisons.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper we revisit a two-level discretization based on localized orthogonal decomposition (LOD). It was originally proposed in [P. Henning, A. Målqvist, and D. Peterseim, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 52 (2014), pp. 1525–1550] to compute ground states of Bose–Einstein condensates by finding discrete minimizers of the Gross–Pitaevskii energy functional. The established convergence rates for the method appeared, however, suboptimal compared to numerical observations and a proof of optimal rates in this setting remained open. In this paper we shall close this gap by proving optimal order error estimates for the [math]- and [math]-errors between the exact ground state and discrete minimizers, as well as error estimates for the ground state energy and the ground state eigenvalue. In particular, the achieved convergence rates for the energy and the eigenvalue are of 6th order with respect to the mesh size on which the discrete LOD space is based, without making any additional regularity assumptions. These high rates justify the use of very coarse meshes, which significantly reduces the computational effort for finding accurate approximations of ground states. In addition, we include numerical experiments that confirm the optimality of the new theoretical convergence rates, for both smooth and discontinuous potentials.]]></summary>

 Abstract. How does a group of agents break indecision when deciding about options with qualities that are hard to distinguish? Biological and artificial multiagent systems, from honeybees and bird flocks to bacteria, robots, and humans, often need to overcome indecision when choosing among options in situations in which the performance or even the survival of the group is at stake. Breaking indecision is also important because in a fully indecisive state, where agents are not biased toward any specific option, the agent group is maximally sensitive and prone to adapt to inputs and changes in its environment. Here, we develop a mathematical theory to study how decisions arise from the breaking of indecision. Our approach is grounded in both equivariant and network bifurcation theory. We model decision from indecision as synchrony-breaking in influence networks in which each node is the value assigned by an agent to an option. First, we show that three universal decision behaviors, namely, deadlock, consensus, and dissensus, are the generic outcomes of synchrony-breaking bifurcations from a fully synchronous state of indecision in influence networks. Second, we show that all deadlock and consensus value patterns and some dissensus value patterns are predicted by the symmetry of the influence networks. Third, we show that there are also many “exotic” dissensus value patterns. These patterns are predicted by network architecture but not by network symmetries through a new synchrony-breaking branching lemma. This is the first example of exotic solutions in an application. Numerical simulations of a novel influence network model illustrate our theoretical results.]]></summary>

Diffusion in heterogeneous media partitioned by semipermeable interfaces has a wide range of applications in the physical and life sciences, ranging from thermal conduction in composite media, gas permeation in soils, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery, and intercellular gap junctions. Many of these systems involve three-dimensional diffusion in an array of parallel planes with homogeneity in the lateral directions, so that they can be reduced to effective one-dimensional (1D) models. In this paper we develop a probabilistic model of single-particle diffusion in 1D multilayered media by constructing a multilayered version of so-called snapping out Brownian motion (BM).

We present a residual-based a posteriori error estimator for the Hybrid High-Order (HHO) method for the Stokes model problem. Both the proposed HHO method and error estimator are valid in two and three dimensions and support arbitrary approximation orders on fairly general meshes. The upper bound and lower bound of the error estimator are proved, in which proof, the key ingredient is a novel stabilizer employed in the discrete scheme. By using the given estimator, adaptive algorithm of HHO method is designed to solve model problem. Finally, the expected theoretical results are numerically demonstrated on a variety of meshes for model problem.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We present the mathematical theory of one-dimensional infinitely periodic chains of subwavelength resonators. We analyze both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems. Subwavelength resonances and associated modes can be accurately predicted by a finite dimensional eigenvalue problem involving a capacitance matrix. We are able to compute the Hermitian and non-Hermitian Zak phases, showing that the former is quantized and the latter is not. Furthermore, we show the existence of localized edge modes arising from defects in the periodicity in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian cases. In the non-Hermitian case, we provide a complete characterization of the edge modes.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The goal of this study is to develop a computer-assisted method for proving the existence of periodic solutions for state-dependent delayed perturbations of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We assume that the unperturbed ODE has an isolated periodic orbit, and derive a set of polynomial inequalities which, if satisfied, imply the existence and uniqueness of a periodic solution in the perturbed system. A general procedure is given, which facilitates the computation of the polynomial coefficients and the optimization of the inputs necessary to satisfy the inequalities on an explicit range of the perturbing parameter. Our approach uses tools from validated numerics and interval arithmetic together with Chebyshev series expansions to obtain the periodic orbit of the ODE as well as the solution of the variational equations. The general procedure is illustrated by proving the existence of some periodic orbits in state-dependent delayed perturbations of the van der Pol equation.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Fluids subject to both thermal and compositional variations can undergo doubly diffusive convection when these properties both affect the fluid density and diffuse at different rates. A variety of patterns can arise from these buoyancy-driven flows, including spatially localized states known as convectons, which consist of convective fluid motion localized within a background of quiescent fluid. We consider these states in a vertical slot with the horizontal temperature and solutal gradients providing competing effects to the fluid density while allowing the existence of a conduction state. In this configuration, convectons have been studied with specific parameter values where the onset of convection is subcritical, and the states have been found to lie on a pair of secondary branches that undergo homoclinic snaking in a parameter regime below the onset of linear instability. In this paper, we show that convectons persist into parameter regimes in which the primary bifurcation is supercritical and there is no bistability, despite coexistence between the stable conduction state and large-amplitude convection. We detail this transition by considering spatial dynamics and observe how the structure of the secondary branches becomes increasingly complex owing to the increased role of inertia at low Prandtl numbers.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We develop a tractable nonparametric model for the time-varying reproductive rate of infectious diseases that combines the structure of a deterministic compartmental model and a stochastic model for incidence data. We use Bayesian inference to estimate, with uncertainty, the reproductive rate of the Coronavirus 2019 outbreak in the U.S. states of California, Florida, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, and Texas from January 2020 to March 2022. Employing the inferred reproductive rates, we estimate the posterior distribution of the time-varying reproduction numbers for each state. Compering the time-varying reproduction numbers across the states, we identify some epidemic waves, potentially driven from changes in human behavior and virus mutations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We introduce extension-based proofs, a class of impossibility proofs that includes valency arguments. They are modelled as an interaction between a prover and a protocol. Using proofs based on combinatorial topology, it has been shown that it is impossible to deterministically solve [math]-set agreement among [math] processes or approximate agreement on a cycle of length 4 among [math] processes in a wait-free manner in asynchronous models where processes communicate using objects that can be constructed from shared registers. However, it was unknown whether proofs based on simpler techniques were possible. We show that these impossibility results cannot be obtained by extension-based proofs in the iterated snapshot model and, hence, extension-based proofs are limited in power.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Precise conditions are provided for the existence and criticality of Turing bifurcations in a general class of activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion equations on a one-dimensional infinite domain. The class includes generalized Schnakenberg and Brusselator models, as well as other models with cubic autocatalytic nonlinear terms. Previous numerical work suggests the existence of a bifurcation structure containing localized patterns due to the so-called homoclinic snaking mechanism. This paper provides explicit calculations to justify those results. Two distinct scalings of parameters that lead to tractable normal-form coefficients are considered in the limit that the diffusion ratio [math]. First, under a small-parameter scaling, the Turing bifurcation is shown to be always subcritical. Second, a large-parameter scaling reveals the Turing bifurcation to be supercritical, leading, by continuity, to the existence of a codimension-two degenerate bifurcation. The sign of a fifth-order normal form coefficient is also computed, which is shown to have the correct sign for the local birth of homoclinic snaking. For the case of the Brusselator, two such codimension-two points can be found explicitly, as can the leading-order expression for the Maxwell point, in a parameter wedge about which localized patterns emerge. Numerical results are found to be consistent with the theory.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
In this paper, we develop a new free-stream preserving (FP) method for high-order upwind conservative finite-difference (FD) schemes on curvilinear grids. This FP method is constructed by subtracting a reference cell-face flow state from each cell-center value in the local stencil of the original upwind schemes, which effectively leads to a reformulated dissipation. It is convenient to implement this method, as it only approximates the cell-center fluxes and conservative variables before reconstructions rather than performs the FP techniques for the central and dissipation parts individually, which avoids introducing considerable complexities to the original reconstruction procedures. In addition, the proposed method removes the constraint in the traditional FP conservative FD schemes that require a consistent scheme for the metrics discretization and the central part of fluxes discretization. With this, the proposed method is more flexible in simulating the engineering problems which usually require a low-order scheme for their low-quality mesh, while the high-order schemes can be applied to approximate the flow states to improve the resolution. After demonstrating the strict FP property and the order of accuracy by two simple test cases, we consider various validation cases, including the supersonic flow around the cylinder, the subsonic flow past the three-element airfoil, and the transonic flow around the ONERA M6 wing, etc., to show that the method is suitable for a wide range of fluid dynamic problems containing complex geometries.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
In this paper, we propose a stochastic Gauss–Newton (SGN) algorithm to study the online principal component analysis (OPCA) problem, which is formulated by using the symmetric low-rank product model for dominant eigenspace calculation. Compared with existing OPCA solvers, SGN is of improved robustness with respect to the varying input data and algorithm parameters. In addition, turning to an evaluation of data stream based on approximated objective functions, we develop a new adaptive stepsize strategy for SGN which requires no priori knowledge of the input data, and numerically illustrate its comparable performance with SGN adopting the manaully-tuned diminishing stepsize. Without assuming the eigengap to be positive, we also establish the global and optimal convergence rate of SGN with the specified stepsize using the diffusion approximation theory.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Motivated by investigating multistationarity in biochemical systems, we address saddle-node bifurcations for chemical reaction networks endowed with general kinetics. At positive equilibria, we identify structural network conditions that guarantee the bifurcation behavior, and we develop a method to identify the proper bifurcation parameters. As a relevant example, we explicitly provide such bifurcation parameters for Michaelis–Menten and Hill kinetics. Examples of applications include reversible feedback cycles, the central carbon metabolism of Escherichia coli, and autocatalytic networks.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The extreme narrow escape theory describes the statistical properties of the fastest among many identical stochastic particles to escape from a narrow window. We study here the escape time of the fastest particle when a killing term is added inside a one-dimensional interval. Killing represents a degradation that leads to removal of the moving particles with a given probability. Using the time dependent flux for the solution of the diffusion equation, we compute asymptotically the mean time for the fastest to escape alive. We use the present theory to study the role of several killing distributions on the mean extreme escape time for the fastest and compare the results with Brownian simulations. Finally, we discuss some applications to calcium dynamics in neuronal cells.]]></summary>

In this paper, we introduce some new definitions and more general results of fractional spaces in order to deal with functions with endpoint singularities. Based on this theoretical framework, we derive optimal decay rates for Chebyshev expansion coefficients by applying the uniform upper bounds of generalized Gegenbauer functions of fractional degree (GGF-Fs). This enables us to further present the optimal 
                      
                      \(L^\infty \)

                    -estimates of the Chebyshev polynomial approximations. In particular, we provide point-wise error estimates and the precise upper and lower bounds for 
                      
                      \(u(x)=(1+x)^{\alpha }\)

                    -norm. Moreover, we also discuss the extension of our main results to optimal error estimates of the related Chebyshev interpolation and quadrature measured in various norms at Chebyshev–Gauss points. Numerical results demonstrate the perfect coincidence with the error estimates. Indeed, the analysis techniques can enrich the theoretical foundation of p and hp methods for singular problems.]]></summary>
