 Abstract. Coarse-graining or model reduction is a term describing a range of approaches used to extend the timescale of molecular simulations by reducing the number of degrees of freedom. In the context of molecular simulation, standard coarse-graining approaches approximate the potential of mean force and use this to drive an effective Markovian model. To gain insight into this process, the simple case of a quadratic energy is studied in an overdamped setting. A hierarchy of reduced models is derived and analyzed, and the merits of these different coarse-graining approaches are discussed. In particular, while standard recipes for model reduction accurately capture static equilibrium statistics, it is shown that dynamical statistics, such as the mean-squared displacement, display systematic error, even when a system exhibits large timescale separation. In the linear setting studied, it is demonstrated both analytically and numerically that such models can be augmented in a simple way to better capture dynamical statistics.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This is the first paper in a series whose goal is to give a polynomial-time algorithm for the 4-coloring problem and the 4-precoloring extension problem restricted to the class of graphs with no induced six-vertex path, thus proving a conjecture of Huang. Combined with previously known results, this completes the classification of the complexity of the 4-coloring problem for graphs with a connected forbidden induced subgraph. In this paper we give a polynomial-time algorithm that determines if a special kind of precoloring of a [math]-free graph has a precoloring extension, and constructs such an extension if one exists. Combined with the main result of the second paper of the series, this gives a complete solution to the problem.]]></summary>

Abstract. We show that lower bounds on the border rank of matrix multiplication can be used to nontrivially derandomize polynomial identity testing for small algebraic circuits. Letting [math] denote the border rank of [math] matrix multiplication, we construct a hitting set generator with seed length [math] that hits [math]-variate circuits of multiplicative complexity [math]. If the matrix multiplication exponent [math] is not 2, our generator has seed length [math] and hits circuits of size [math] for sufficiently small [math]. Surprisingly, the fact that [math] already yields new, nontrivial hitting set generators for circuits of sublinear multiplicative complexity.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The random geometric graph model [math] is a distribution over graphs in which the edges capture a latent geometry. To sample [math], we identify each of our [math] vertices with an independently and uniformly sampled vector from the [math]-dimensional unit sphere [math], and we connect pairs of vertices whose vectors are “sufficiently close,” such that the marginal probability of an edge is [math]. Because of the underlying geometry, this model is natural for applications in data science and beyond. We investigate the problem of testing for this latent geometry, or, in other words, distinguishing an Erdős–Rényi graph [math] from a random geometric graph [math]. It is not too difficult to show that if [math] while [math] is held fixed,…]]></summary>

 Abstract. There are two main approaches to modelling interfaces within nonequilibrium thermodynamics, the so-called sharp and diffuse interface models. Both of them are based on the local equilibrium assumption (LEA) in the bulk, but the latter additionally assumes the validity of this concept also within the interface itself (as the thermodynamic description is available and smoothly varying even within the interface), that is, on a finer length scale, which we call super-LEA. Instead of testing the two approaches against molecular dynamic simulations, we explore the mutual compatibility of these two descriptions of an interface in a nonequilibrium situation. Based on the level of detail in the two framework…]]></summary>

 Abstract.A class of four-component reaction-diffusion systems are studied in one spatial dimension, with one of four specific reaction kinetics. Models of this type seek to capture the interaction between active and inactive forms of two G-proteins, known as ROPs in plants, thought to underly cellular polarity formation. The systems conserve total concentration of each ROP, which enables reduction to simple canonical forms when one seeks conditions for homogeneous equilibria or heteroclinic connections between them. Transitions between different multiplicities of such states are classified using a novel application of catastrophe theory. For the time-dependent problem, the heteroclinic connections represent so-called wave-pinned states that separate regions of the domain with different ROP concentrations. It is shown numerically how the form of wave-pinning reached can be predicted as a function of the domain size and initial total ROP concentrations. This leads to state diagrams of different polarity forms as a function of total concentrations and system parameters.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We give an online algorithm that with high probability computes a [math] edge coloring on a graph [math] with maximum degree [math] under online edge arrivals against oblivious adversaries, making first progress on the conjecture of Bar-Noy, Motwani, and Naor in this general setting. Our algorithm is based on reducing to a matching problem on locally treelike graphs, and then applying a tree recurrence based approach for arguing correlation decay.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We relate discrepancy theory with the classic scheduling problems of minimizing max flow time and total flow time on unrelated machines. Specifically, we give a general reduction that allows us to transfer discrepancy bounds in the prefix Beck–Fiala (bounded [math]-norm) setting to bounds on the flow time of an optimal schedule. Combining our reduction with a deep result proved by Banaszczyk via convex geometry gives guarantees of [math] and [math] for max flow time and total flow time, respectively, improving upon the previous best guarantees of [math] and [math]. Apart from the improved guarantees, the reduction motivates seemingly easy versions of prefix discrepancy questions: any constant bound on prefix Beck–Fiala where vectors have sparsity two (sparsity one being trivial) would already yield tight guarantees for both max flow time and total flow time. While known techniques solve this case when the entries take values in [math], we show that they are unlikely to transfer to the more general 2-sparse case of bounded [math]-norm.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
We consider the Davey–Stewartson system in the hyperbolic–elliptic case (DS-II) in two dimensional case. It is a mass-critical equation, and was proved recently by Nachman et al. (Invent Math 220(2):395–451, 2020) the global well-posedness and scattering in 
                      
                      \(L^2\)
                      
                    . In this paper, we give the numerical study on this model and construct a first order low-regularity integrator for the DS-II in the periodic case. It only requires the boundedness of one additional derivative of the solution to get the first order convergence. The Fast Fourier Transform is exploited to speed up the numerical implementation. By rigorous error analysis, we prove that the numerical scheme provides first order convergence in 
                      
                      \(H^{\gamma }({\mathbb {T}}^{2})\)

Motivated by the PageRank model for graph partitioning, we develop an extension of PageRank for partitioning uniform hypergraphs. Starting from adjacency tensors of uniform hypergraphs, we establish the multi-linear pseudo-PageRank (MLPPR) model, which is formulated as a multi-linear system with nonnegative constraints. The coefficient tensor of MLPPR is a kind of Laplacian tensors of uniform hypergraphs, which are almost as sparse as adjacency tensors since no dangling corrections are incorporated. Furthermore, all frontal slices of the coefficient tensor of MLPPR are M-matrices. Theoretically, MLPPR has a solution, which is unique under mild conditions. An error bound of the MLPPR solution is analyzed when the Laplacian tensor is slightly perturbed. Computationally, by exploiting the structural Laplacian tensor, we propose a tensor splitting algorithm, which converges linearly to a solution of MLPPR. Finally, numerical experiments illustrate that MLPPR is effective and efficient for hypergraph partitioning problems.]]></summary>

The exponential time differencing Runge–Kutta method (ETDRK) developed by Cox and Matthews has proven effective in computing nonlinear partial differential equation. However, it is difficult to prove the unconditional energy stability for third-order or higher ETDRK method. In this paper, we proposed a new third-order ETDRK scheme, ETDRK3, and prove its unconditional energy stability. Combining ETDRK3 with a second-order scheme ETDRK2, we proposed an adaptive ETDRK method(ETDRK32). Furthermore, the numerical simulations for phase problems demonstrate the accuracy, stability and efficiency of adaptive step-size strategy.]]></summary>

In this paper, an oscillation-free spectral volume (OFSV) method is proposed and studied for the hyperbolic conservation laws. The numerical scheme is designed by introducing a damping term in the standard spectral volume method for the purpose of controlling spurious oscillations near discontinuities. Based on the construction of control volumes (CVs), two classes of OFSV schemes are presented. A mathematical proof is provided to show that the proposed OFSV is stable and has optimal convergence rate and some desired superconvergence properties when applied to the linear scalar equations. Both analysis and numerical experiments indicate that the damping term would not destroy the order of accuracy of the original SV scheme and can control the oscillations near discontinuities effectively. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our scheme.]]></summary>

We introduce finite difference time domain (FDTD) methods for solving the Dirac equation coupled with the Chern–Simons gauge field and provide their error estimates. To discretize the spinor equation, we utilize well-known FDTD schemes, including the Crank–Nicolson method, leap-frog method, and semi-implicit methods. On the other hand, to discretize the gauge equations, we mainly employ the Lorenz gauge condition and derive Crank–Nicolson or leap-frog type finite difference methods for the gauge equations. We establish the error estimates for the introduced FDTD methods and prove the second-order accuracy both in space and time. Numerical examples are also presented to validate the second-order convergence and illustrate the dependencies of the numerical solutions on the parameters or gauge conditions.]]></summary>

We propose a new parallel discontinuous Galerkin method for the approximation of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. The method remains stable with large time steps, while keeping the complexity of an explicit scheme: it does not require the assembly and resolution of large linear systems for the time iterations. The approach is based on a kinetic representation of the system of conservation laws previously investigated by the authors. Coulette et al.

 Abstract. Following the seminal work of [R. R. Williams, J. ACM, 61 (2014)], in a recent breakthrough, [C. D. Murray and R. R. Williams, STOC 2018] proved that [math] (nondeterministic quasi-polynomial time) does not have polynomial-size [math] circuits (constant depth circuits consisting of [math]/[math]/[math] gates for a fixed constant [math], a frontier class in circuit complexity). We strengthen the above lower bound to an average-case one, by proving that for all constants [math], there is a language in [math] that cannot be [math]-approximated by polynomial-size [math] circuits. Our work also improves the average-case lower bound for [math] against polynomial-size [math] circuits by [R. Chen, I. C. Oliveira, and R. Santhanam, LATIN 2018, …]]></summary>

In contrast to the conventional entanglement-separability paradigm in quantum information theory, we embark on a different path by introducing a classical dichotomy. We aim to quantify a measurement’s disturbance by minimizing the difference between input and post-measurement states to distinguish either classical or quantum correlations. Theoretically, we apply a complex-valued gradient flow over Stiefel manifolds for minimization. Our focus extends beyond the practical application to encompass the well-known Łojasiewicz gradient inequality. This inequality is a fundamental tool that guarantees the global convergence of the flow from any initial starting point to the optimal solution. Numerically, we validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method by performing a series of experiments in different scenarios. Experimental results suggest the capability of our approach to accurately and reliably characterize correlations as classical or quantum.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We consider the problem of clustering mixtures of mean-separated Gaussians in high dimensions. We are given samples from a mixture of [math] identity covariance Gaussians, so that the minimum pairwise distance between any two pairs of means is at least [math], for some parameter [math], and the goal is to recover the ground truth clustering of these samples. It is folklore that separation [math] is both necessary and sufficient to recover a good clustering (say, with constant or [math] error), at least information-theoretically. However, the estimators which achieve this guarantee are inefficient. We give the first algorithm which runs in polynomial time in both [math] and the dimension [math], and which almost matches this guarantee. More precisely, we give an algorithm which takes polynomially many samples and time, and which can successfully recover a good clustering, so long as the separation is [math], for any [math]. Previously, polynomial time algorithms were only known for this problem when the separation was polynomial in [math], and all algorithms which could tolerate [math] separation required quasipolynomial time. We also extend our result to mixtures of translations of a distribution which satisfies the Poincaré inequality, under additional mild assumptions. Our main technical tool, which we believe is of independent interest, is a novel way to implicitly represent and estimate high degree moments of a distribution, which allows us to extract important information about high degree moments without ever writing down the full moment tensors explicitly.]]></summary>

Discrete wavelet methods, originally formulated in the setting of regularly sampled signals, can be adapted to data defined on a point cloud if some multiresolution structure is imposed on the cloud. A wide variety of hierarchical clustering algorithms can be used for this purpose, and the multiresolution structure obtained can be encoded by a hierarchical tree of subsets of the cloud. Prior work introduced the use of Haar-like bases defined with respect to such trees for approximation and learning tasks on unstructured data. This paper builds on that work in two directions. First, we present an algorithm for constructing Haar-like bases on general discrete hierarchical trees. Second, with an eye towards data compression, we present thresholding techniques for data defined on a point cloud with error controlled in the

 Abstract.In this paper, we study a two stream species Lotka–Volterra competition patch model with the patches aligned along a line. The two species are supposed to be identical except for the diffusion rates. For each species, the diffusion rates between patches are the same, while the drift rates vary. Our results show that the convexity of the drift rates has a significant impact on the competition outcomes: if the drift rates are convex, then the species with the larger diffusion rate wins the competition; if the drift rates are concave, then the species with the smaller diffusion rate wins the competition.]]></summary>

Abstract.To model a single-species cognitive movement, we formulate a reaction-diffusion equation with nonlocal spatial memory and investigate its dynamics. We explore the influence of the perceptual scale on the stability and Turing bifurcation. When the random diffusion is dominant, the perceptual scale does not affect the stability, but when the memory-based diffusion is dominant, there exist Turing bifurcations induced by the perceptual scale. Then the joint effect of the perceptual scale and the memory delay on the stability and spatio-temporal dynamics is investigated to show rich spatio-temporal dynamics via Turing–Hopf bifurcation and double Hopf bifurcation. Finally, we apply our analysis to an application and illustrate our theoretical results with numerical simulations.]]></summary>

 Abstract.We present a geometrical description of the symmetries and reduction of the full gravitational 2-body problem after complete averaging over fast angles. Our variables allow for a well-suited formulation in action-angle type coordinates associated with the averaged angles, which provide geometric insight into the problem. After introducing extra fictitious variables and through a symplectic transformation, we move to a singularity-free quaternionic triple-chart. This choice allows for a global chart to avoid the classical singularities associated with angles and renders all the invariants as homogeneous quadratic polynomials. Additionally, it permits one to quickly write the Hamiltonian of the system in terms of the invariants and the Poisson structure at each stage of the reduction process. In contrast with existing literature, the geometrical approach of this research completely describes all the dynamical aspects of the full reduced space since it involves the relative position of the rotational and orbital angular momenta and their orientation, which has yet to be considered in previous studies. Our program includes a preliminary parametric analysis of relative equilibria and a complete description of the fibers in the reconstruction of the reduced system.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In the Maximum Independent Set problem we are asked to find a set of pairwise nonadjacent vertices in a given graph with the maximum possible cardinality. In general graphs, this classical problem is known to be NP-hard and hard to approximate within a factor of [math] for any [math]. Due to this, investigating the complexity of Maximum Independent Set in various graph classes in hope of finding better tractability results is an active research direction. In [math]-free graphs, that is, graphs not containing a fixed graph [math] as an induced subgraph, the problem is known to remain NP-hard and APX-hard whenever [math] contains a cycle, a vertex of degree at least four, or two vertices of degree at least three in one connected component. For the remaining cases, where every component of [math] is a path or a subdivided claw, the complexity of Maximum Independent Set remains widely open, with only a handful of polynomial-time solvability results for small graphs [math] such as [math], [math], the claw, or the fork. We prove that for every such “possibly tractable” graph [math] there exists an algorithm that, given an [math]-free graph [math] and an accuracy parameter [math], finds an independent set in [math] of cardinality within a factor of [math] of the optimum in time exponential in a polynomial of [math] and [math]. Furthermore, an independent set of maximum size can be found in subexponential time [math]. That is, we show that for every graph [math] for which Maximum Independent Set is not known to be APX-hard and SUBEXP-hard in [math]-free graphs, the problem admits a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme and a subexponential-time exact algorithm in this graph class. Our algorithms also work in the more general weighted setting, where the input graph is supplied with a weight function on vertices and we are maximizing the total weight of an independent set.]]></summary>

Transfer learning for partial differential equations (PDEs) is to develop a pre-trained neural network that can be used to solve a wide class of PDEs. Existing transfer learning approaches require much information about the target PDEs such as its formulation and/or data of its solution for pre-training. In this work, we propose to design transferable neural feature spaces for the shallow neural networks from purely function approximation perspectives without using PDE information. The construction of the feature space involves the re-parameterization of the hidden neurons and uses auxiliary functions to tune the resulting feature space. Theoretical analysis shows the high quality of the produced feature space, i.e., uniformly distributed neurons. We use the proposed feature space as the pre-determined feature space of a random feature model, and use existing least squares solvers to obtain the weights of the output layer. Extensive numerical experiments verify the outstanding performance of our method, including significantly improved transferability, e.g., using the same feature space for various PDEs with different domains and boundary conditions, and the superior accuracy, e.g., several orders of magnitude smaller mean squared error than the state of the art methods.]]></summary>

First-order hydrostatic reconstruction (HR) schemes for shallow water equations are highly diffusive whereas high-order schemes can produce entropy-violating solutions. Our goal is to develop a flux correction with maximum antidiffusive fluxes to obtain entropy solutions of shallow water equations with variable bottom topography. For this purpose, we consider a hybrid explicit HR scheme whose flux is a convex combination of first-order Rusanov flux and high-order flux. The conditions under which the explicit first-order HR scheme for shallow water equations satisfies the fully discrete entropy inequality have been studied. The flux limiters for the hybrid scheme are calculated from a corresponding optimization problem. Constraints for the optimization problem consist of inequalities that are valid for the first-order HR scheme and applied to the hybrid scheme. We apply the discrete cell entropy inequality with the proper numerical entropy flux to single out a physically relevant solution to the shallow water equations. A nontrivial approximate solution of the optimization problem yields expressions to compute the required flux limiters. Numerical results of testing various HR schemes on different benchmarks are presented.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We analyze and quantify the amount of heat generated by a nanoparticle, injected in a background medium, while excited by incident electromagnetic waves. These nanoparticles are dispersive with electric permittivity following the Lorentz model. The purpose is to determine the quantity of heat generated extremely close to the nanoparticle (at a distance proportional to the radius of the nanoparticle). This study extends our previous results, derived in the 2D TM and TE regimes, to the full Maxwell system. We show that by exciting the medium with incident frequencies close to the plasmonic or Dielectric resonant frequencies, we can generate any desired amount of heat close to the injected nanoparticle while the amount of heat decreases away from it. These results offer a wide range of potential applications in the areas of photo-thermal therapy, drug delivery, and material science, to cite a few. To do so, we employ time-domain integral equations and asymptotic analysis techniques to study the corresponding mathematical model for heat generation. This model is given by the heat equation where the body source term comes from the modulus of the electric field generated by the used incident electromagnetic field. Therefore, we first analyze the dominant term of this electric field by studying the full Maxwell scattering problem in the presence of plasmonic or all-dielectric nanoparticles. As a second step, we analyze the propagation of this dominant electric field in the estimation of the heat potential. For both the electromagnetic and parabolic models, the presence of the nanoparticles is translated into the appearance of large scales in the contrasts for the heat-conductivity (for the parabolic model) and the permittivity (for the full Maxwell system) between the nanoparticle and its surroundings.]]></summary>

We develop a distributed Block Chebyshev-Davidson algorithm to solve large-scale leading eigenvalue problems for spectral analysis in spectral clustering. First, the efficiency of the Chebyshev-Davidson algorithm relies on the prior knowledge of the eigenvalue spectrum, which could be expensive to estimate. This issue can be lessened by the analytic spectrum estimation of the Laplacian or normalized Laplacian matrices in spectral clustering, making the proposed algorithm very efficient for spectral clustering. Second, to make the proposed algorithm capable of analyzing big data, a distributed and parallel version has been developed with attractive scalability. The speedup by parallel computing is approximately equivalent to 
                      
                      \(\sqrt{p}\)
                      
                    , where p denotes the number of processes. Numerical results will be provided to demonstrate its efficiency in spectral clustering and scalability advantage over existing eigensolvers used for spectral clustering in parallel computing environments.]]></summary>

We propose an Eulerian–Lagrangian (EL) Runge–Kutta (RK) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for a linear hyperbolic system. The method is designed based on the ELDG method for transport problems (J Comput Phys 446:110,632, 2021), which tracks solutions along approximations to characteristics in the DG framework, allowing extra large time stepping sizes with stability with respect to the classical RKDG method. Considering each characteristic family, a straightforward application of ELDG for the hyperbolic system will be to transform to the characteristic variables, evolve them on associated characteristic-related space–time regions, and transform them back to the original variables. However, the conservation could not be guaranteed in a general setting. In this paper, we formulate a conservative semi-discrete ELDG method by decomposing each variable into two parts, each of them associated with a different characteristic family. As a result, four different quantities are evolved in EL fashion and recombined to update the solution. The fully discrete scheme is formulated by using method-of-lines RK methods, with intermediate RK solutions updated on the background mesh. Numerical results for 1D and 2D wave equations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed ELDG method. These include the high order spatial and temporal accuracy, stability with extra large time stepping size, and conservative property.]]></summary>

For magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, the existing entropy stable (ES) flux effectively eliminates the spurious oscillation, but it still has potential for improvement such as the resolution of discontinuous solutions. We propose a high-resolution scheme based on a moving mesh strategy for approximating solutions of ideal MHD and shallow water MHD (SWMHD) in this paper. Firstly, a new S-M flux limiter is constructed to weigh the ES flux and the anti-diffusive flux to obtain a new flux with high resolution and entropy stability properties. By adjusting the amplitude of anti-diffusive flux adaptively, the new flux can reduce its dissipation in smooth regions and increase dissipation at discontinuities, which is more consistent with physical laws. Secondly, we introduce the moving mesh strategy to optimize mesh generation and eliminate the defects of structured mesh. A new monitor function is defined to identify structural features of solutions at each particular time level and to assign appropriate weights to all regions with large numerical solution gradients, to construct a mesh evolution equation and increase the mesh density of these regions. Finally, we combine the moving mesh strategy with the high-resolution ES scheme and evaluate more accurate solutions according to the order of “mesh redistribution-update of solution-equation solving on new mesh”. Numerical results show that the new algorithm can achieve strong robustness and high resolution, and can track various waves effectively (especially the shock and rarefaction waves).]]></summary>

 Abstract. Given a directed graph as input, we show how to efficiently find a shortest (directed, simple) cycle on an even number of vertices. As far as we know, no polynomial-time algorithm was previously known for this problem. In fact, finding any even cycle in a directed graph in polynomial time was open for more than two decades until Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas (Ann. of Math. (2), 150 (1999), pp. 929–975) and, independently, McCuaig (Electron. J. Combin., 11 (2004), R7900) (announced jointly at STOC 1997) gave an efficiently testable structural characterization of even-cycle-free directed graphs. Methodologically, our algorithm relies on the standard framework of algebraic fingerprinting and randomized polynomial identity testing over a …]]></summary>

The Navier equation is the governing equation of elastic waves, and computing its solution accurately and rapidly has a wide range of applications in geophysical exploration, materials science, etc. In this paper, we focus on the efficient and high-precision numerical algorithm for the time harmonic elastic wave scattering problems from cornered domains via the boundary integral equations in two dimensions. The approach is based on the combination of Nyström discretization, analytical singular integrals and kernel-splitting method, which results in a high-order solver for smooth boundaries. It is then combined with the recursively compressed inverse preconditioning (RCIP) method to solve elastic scattering problems from cornered domains. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy, with stabilized errors close to machine precision in various geometric configurations. The algorithm is further applied to investigate the asymptotic behavior of density functions associated with boundary integral operators near corners, and the numerical results are highly consistent with the theoretical formulas.]]></summary>

In this work, we analyze the finite element method with arbitrary but fixed polynomial degree for the nonlinear Helmholtz equation with impedance boundary conditions.
