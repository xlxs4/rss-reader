Hermite interpolation is classically used to reconstruct smooth data when the function and its first order derivatives are available at certain nodes. If first order derivatives are not available, it is easy to set a system of equations imposing some regularity conditions at the data nodes in order to obtain them. This process leads to the construction of a Hermite spline. The problem of the described Hermite splines is that the accuracy is lost if the data contains singularities. The consequence is the appearance of oscillations, if there is a jump discontinuity in the function, that globally affects the accuracy of the spline, or the smearing of singularities, if the discontinuities are in the derivatives of the function. This paper is devoted to the construction and analysis of a new technique that allows for the computation of accurate first order derivatives of a function close to singularities using a Hermite spline. The idea is to correct the system of equations of the spline in order to attain the desired accuracy even close to the singularities. Once we have computed the first order derivatives with enough accuracy, a correction term is added to the Hermite spline in the intervals that contain a singularity. The aim is to reconstruct piecewise smooth functions with 
                      
                      \(O(h^4)\)
                      
                     accuracy even close to the singularities. The process of adaption will require some knowledge about the position of the singularity and the jumps of the function and some of its derivatives at the singularity. The whole process can be used as a post-processing, where a correction term is added to the classical cubic Hermite spline. Proofs for the accuracy and regularity of the corrected spline and its derivatives are given. We also analyse the mechanism that eliminates the Gibbs phenomenon close to jump discontinuities in the function. The numerical experiments presented confirm the theoretical results obtained.]]></summary>

Due to its significance in terms of wave phenomena a considerable effort has been put into the design of preconditioners for the Helmholtz equation. One option to design a preconditioner is to apply a multigrid method on a shifted operator. In such an approach, the wavenumber is shifted by some imaginary value. This step is motivated by the observation that the shifted problem can be more efficiently handled by iterative solvers when compared to the standard Helmholtz equation. However, up to now, it is not obvious what the best strategy for the choice of the shift parameter is. It is well known that a good shift parameter depends sensitively on the wavenumber and the discretization parameters such as the order and the mesh size. Therefore, we study the choice of a near optimal complex shift such that a flexible generalized minimal residual (FGMRES) solver converges with fewer iterations. Our goal is to provide a map which returns the near optimal shift for the preconditioner depending on the wavenumber and the mesh size. In order to compute this map, a data driven approach is considered: We first generate many samples, and in a second step, we perform a nonlinear regression on this data. With this representative map, the near optimal shift can be obtained by a simple evaluation. Our preconditioner is based on a twogrid V-cycle applied to the shifted problem, allowing us to implement a semi matrix-free method in which only the coarse grid and boundary matrices need to be stored in memory. On the fine grid, only the action of the matrix applied to a vector is computed, without assembling the global matrix. This enables efficient use of computing resources and allows problems to be solved at scales that were previously limited by the available memory. The performance of our preconditioned FGMRES solver is illustrated by several benchmark problems with heterogeneous wavenumbers in two and three space dimensions.]]></summary>

In this paper, a priori and a posteriori error estimates of the tangential-displacement normal-normal-stress (TDNNS) method for linear elasticity problem with strongly symmetric stress tensors are proposed. The error estimator is established by decomposing the stress error into two components via the introduction of an auxiliary problem. The local efficiency of the error estimator is proved via bubble function techniques. Then, we derive a priori error estimates under minimal regularity. Classical methodologies rely on Galerkin orthogonality, which hinges on the well-defined trace variables on the inter-element boundaries. In order to circumvent the Galerkin orthogonality, an alternative methodology in the spirit of the medius analysis is established to prove the convergence error estimates for

In this series of works, we develop a discrete-velocity-direction model (DVDM) with collisions of BGK-type for simulating rarefied flows. Unlike the conventional kinetic models (both BGK and discrete-velocity models), the new model restricts the transport to finite fixed directions but leaves the transport speed to be a 1-D continuous variable. Analogous to the BGK equation, the discrete equilibriums of the model are determined by minimizing a discrete entropy. In this first paper, we introduce the DVDM and investigate its basic properties, including the existence of the discrete equilibriums and the H-theorem. We also show that the discrete equilibriums can be efficiently obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. The proposed model provides a new way in choosing discrete velocities for the computational practice of the conventional discrete-velocity methodology. It also facilitates a convenient multidimensional extension of the extended quadrature method of moments. We validate the model with numerical experiments for two benchmark problems at moderate computational costs.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Investigation of biological systems often requires reconstruction of an unobservable continuous process from discrete time-series data sampled from a related process or processes. When the reconstructed process cannot be validated with experimental data, it is particularly important to quantify the uncertainty on the inferred process, and new methodologies are needed to support both the inference and uncertainty quantification. This work derives a novel statistical model that combines an established differential model of intra- and extravascular C-peptide dynamics with a Gaussian process model of insulin secretion rate (ISR) in order to provide clinical measures of beta-cell function with quantified uncertainty. These measures are computed from the ISR that is inferred from measured C-peptide data. The model is first validated using synthetic data, and then applied to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) data from youth participants with and without cystic fibrosis (CF). Because CF is characterized by scarring and fibrosis of the pancreas, impairment of beta-cell function, rather than reduced insulin sensitivity, is implicated in the early etiology of CF-related diabetes (CFRD). ISR-derived measures of beta-cell function show worsening beta-cell function from healthy control to CF to CFRD groups consistent with previous reports on dysglycemia in CF. However, the model additionally allows uncertainty in the data to be propagated to ISR and ISR-derived measures of beta-cell function. These results provide insight into uncertainty in ISR-derived measures of beta cell function, characterize interindividual variability in CFRD etiology, and provide novel metrics to quantify the pathogenesis of CFRD.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We propose an extension of the well-known Klausmeier model of vegetation to two plant species that consume water at different rates. Rather than competing directly, the plants compete through their intake of water, which is a shared resource between them. In semiarid regions, the Klausmeier model produces vegetation spot patterns. We are interested in how the competition for water affects the coexistence and stability of patches of different plant species. We consider two plant types—a “thirsty” species and a “frugal” species—that only differ by the amount of water they consume per unit growth, while being identical in other aspects. We find that there is a finite range of precipitation rate for which two species can coexist. Outside of that range (when the rate is either sufficiently low or high), the frugal species out-competes the thirsty species. As the precipitation rate is decreased, there is a sequence of stability thresholds such that thirsty plant patches are the first to die off, while the frugal spots remain resilient for longer. The pattern consisting of only frugal spots is the most resilient. The next most resilient pattern consists of all-thirsty patches, with the mixed pattern being less resilient than either of the homogeneous patterns. We also examine numerically what happens for very large precipitation rates. We find that for a sufficiently high rate, the frugal plant takes over the entire range, out-competing the thirsty plant.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Let [math], [math], be a family of functions in [math], and [math] be a reconstruction of [math] from its discrete Radon transform data. Here [math] is both the data sampling rate and the parameter of the family. We study the resolution of reconstruction when [math] has a jump discontinuity along a nonsmooth curve [math]. The assumptions are that (a) [math] is a family of [math]-size perturbations of a smooth curve [math], and (b) [math] is Hölder continuous with some exponent [math]. Thus the size of the perturbation [math] is of the same order of magnitude as the data sampling rate. We compute the discrete transition behavior (DTB) defined as the limit [math], where [math] is generic. We illustrate the DTB by two sets of numerical experiments. In the first set, the perturbation is a smooth, rapidly oscillating sinusoid, and in the second, a fractal curve. The experiments reveal that the match between the DTB and reconstruction is worse as [math] gets rougher. This is in agreement with the proof of the DTB, which suggests that the rate of convergence to the limit is [math]. We then propose a new DTB, which exhibits an excellent agreement with reconstructions. Investigation of this phenomenon requires computing the rate of convergence for the new DTB. This, in turn, requires completely new approaches. We obtain a partial result along these lines and formulate a conjecture that the rate of convergence of the new DTB is [math].]]></summary>

 Abstract. In fiber drawing, axial tension is applied to long, thin viscous threads to increase their length and consequently reduce their cross-sectional area. This process is used to manufacture rods and threads of glass and polymer such as optical fibers and filaments for textiles. Drawing is described mathematically using the Trouton model for extensional flow in a long, narrow cylinder. This leading-order description gives simple expressions for fiber radius and one-dimensional axial velocity in the long, slender limit. In this paper we determine the next-order corrections, showing that they can be an order of magnitude larger than previously assumed.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper we investigate some electric, thermal, and thermoelectric properties of suspended monolayer graphene. By means of a numerical experiment, which was made employing a previously developed macroscopic model for charge and energy transport in graphene, we analyze how fast a suspended graphene sheet heats up when it is subject to a constant homogeneous electric field and how it reaches the equilibrium state once the electric field is turned off. We consider electrons and all phonon branches and show that the influence of the out-of-plane acoustical phonons on the final equilibrium temperature is notable due to their great surface heat capacity. The influence of the electrons on the equilibrium temperature depends on their density; in fact the higher it is, the more energy they gain from the electric field. The behavior of the system can be theoretically justified on the basis of two important physical properties: the conservation of the total energy and the increase of the total entropy of the electron-phonon system; of the latter we give an almost explicit expression. After that, we study the electronic thermal and electric conductivity and the thermopower by finding formulas which express them as functions of the electron and phonon temperatures and the electron density by using a suitable recasting of the macroscopic model in the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Boundary value problems for diffusion in singularly perturbed domains is a topic of considerable current interest. Applications include intracellular diffusive transport and the spread of pollutants or heat from localized sources. In a previous paper, we introduced a new method for characterizing the approach to steady state in the case of two-dimensional (2D) diffusion. This was based on a local measure of the relaxation rate known as the accumulation time [math]. The latter was calculated by solving the diffusion equation in Laplace space using a combination of matched asymptotics and Green’s function methods. We thus obtained an asymptotic expansion of [math] in powers of [math], where [math] specifies the relative size of the holes. In this paper, we develop the corresponding theory for three-dimensional (3D) diffusion. The analysis is a nontrivial extension of the 2D case due to differences in the singular nature of the Laplace transformed Green’s function. In particular, the asymptotic expansion of the solution of the 3D diffusion equation in Laplace space involves terms of order [math], where [math] is the Laplace variable. These [math]-singularities have to be removed by partial series resummations in order to obtain an asymptotic expansion of [math] in powers of [math].]]></summary>

 Abstract. A family of results, referred to as inheritance results, tell us which enlargements of a chemical reaction network (CRN) preserve its capacity for nontrivial behaviours such as multistationarity and oscillation. In this paper, the following inheritance result is proved: under mild assumptions, splitting chemical reactions and inserting complexes involving some new chemical species preserves the capacity of a mass action CRN for multiple nondegenerate equilibria and/or periodic orbits. The claim has been proved previously for equilibria alone; however, the generalisation to include oscillation involves extensive development of rather different techniques. Several inheritance results for multistationarity and oscillation in mass action CRNs, including the main result of this paper, are gathered into a single theorem. Examples are presented showing how these results can be used together to make claims about reaction networks based on knowledge of their subnetworks. The examples include some networks of biological importance.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A new coupled perfectly matched layer (PML) method is proposed for the Helmholtz equation in the whole space with inhomogeneity concentrated on a nonconvex domain. Rigorous analysis is presented for the stability and convergence of the proposed coupled PML method, which shows that the PML solution converges to the solution of the original Helmholtz problem exponentially with respect to the product of the wave number and the width of the layer. An iterative algorithm and a continuous interior penalty finite element method (CIP-FEM) are also proposed for solving the system of equations associated to the coupled PML. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the convergence and performance of the proposed coupled PML method, as well as the iterative algorithm and the CIP-FEM.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) is a lattice-based stochastic model for spatially resolved cellular processes. It is often interpreted as an approximation to spatially continuous reaction-diffusion models, which, in the limit of an infinitely large population, may be described by means of reaction-diffusion partial differential equations. Analyzing and understanding the relation between different mathematical models for reaction-diffusion dynamics is a research topic of steady interest. In this work, we explore a route to the hydrodynamic limit of the RDME which uses gradient structures. Specifically, we elaborate on a method introduced in [J. Maas and A. Mielke, J. Stat. Phys., 181 (2020), pp. 2257–2303] in the context of well-mixed reaction networks by showing that, once it is complemented with an appropriate limit procedure, it can be applied to spatially extended systems with diffusion. Under the assumption of detailed balance, we write down a gradient structure for the RDME and use the method in order to produce a gradient structure for its hydrodynamic limit, namely, for the corresponding RDPDE.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A transmission eigenvalue problem for nonlinear Maxwell’s equations that describes propagation of monochromatic transverse electric waves in a dielectric film having cubic inhomogeneous permittivity sandwiched between two half-spaces with constant permittivities is considered. It is proved that even if the nonlinearity coefficient is small, there exist guided waves with as well as without linear counterparts. The found theoretical results predict existence of a new type of nonlinear guided waves. The paper suggest an original mathematical approach that allows one to determine asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues and zeros of the eigenfunctions. Numerical results are given to illustrate the theoretical findings.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A PDE-ODE coupled dynamic model is proposed to describe the asymmetric competition for light and nutrients between producers in a poorly mixed pelagic habitat and producers in a well-mixed benthic habitat. Several basic ecological reproductive indices are rigorously derived for pelagic producers and benthic producers by analyzing nonnegative steady-state solutions. The possible scenarios of the asymmetric competition are explicitly formulated. The numerical bifurcation diagrams show that the environmental parameters affect the asymmetric competition and cause the regime switch between pelagic and benthic producers. The results reveal the role of spatial heterogeneity of pelagic producers and some characteristics of the asymmetric resource competition.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Asymptotic methods are employed to analyze earlier two-phase steady-state Euler–Euler models that were originally intended as simplified representations for gas-solid flow in an ironmaking blast furnace; more generally, however, they can be thought of as models for two-phase flow in countercurrent moving bed reactors. A scaling analysis, based around the fact that the solid velocity is typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the gas velocity, indicates that the effects of viscosity and inertia are basically negligible compared with those of gravity and interphase momentum transfer. The resulting reduced model yields quasi-analytical expressions for the solid fraction and the gas velocity, with the former being directly related to the shapes of the reactor and any stagnant zone that may form as a consequence of solids or granular materials being able to withstand substantial amounts of shear; in ironmaking blast furnaces, this occurs near the bottom of the reactor, and the zone is commonly known as the deadman. On the other hand, the solid velocity can be found via a numerical solution of Laplace’s equation; nevertheless, the solution is different to that obtained from earlier potential flow models in blast furnace modeling. Most significantly, the current model would form the basis of a computationally efficient approach for modeling transient heat and mass transfer with chemical reactions in a countercurrent moving bed reactor.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Heterogeneity plays an important role in cancer genesis and progression. In this paper, we theoretically and computationally show that the increase of heterogeneity signals predeterioration during tumor progression by unified random ordinary differential equations (RODEs). Tumor formation results from a systematic change in organisms, and its causality is complex. Heterogeneity may be one of the key factors under some conditions. Specifically, the interactions between cell populations are modeled by random community matrices in normal tissues, benign tumors, and malignant tumors, and then we prove that the RODEs system describing the cell density of normal tissues or benign tumors becomes unstable as heterogeneity of cell populations or species increases. The increase of heterogeneity is an important signal. Heterogeneity can be viewed as a feature to distinguish benign tumors from malignant tumors under certain circumstances. Furthermore, we show that with the increase of heterogeneity, the divergence speed of the RODEs system becomes faster, which implies that malignant tumors with higher heterogeneity may develop faster and have poorer prognoses. Our theoretical findings can explain some noteworthy phenomena in various datasets in tumor patients and our biological experiments in mice from a mathematical viewpoint. Particularly, clinical data and mutation information from the cancer genome atlas and our experiments in mice revealed that tumors with higher heterogeneity usually show shorter survival time, whereas tumors with lower heterogeneity tend to have better prognosis, which also indicates that heterogeneity can be used as a potential biomarker in future clinical diagnosis. Targeting the heterogeneity may be a potential strategy for the cancer treatment.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We strengthen the standard bifurcation theorems for saddle-node, transcritical, pitchfork, and period-doubling bifurcations of maps. Our new formulation involves adding one or two extra terms to the standard truncated normal forms with coefficients determined by algebraic equations. These extended normal forms are differentiably conjugate to the original maps on basins of attraction and repulsion of fixed points or periodic orbits. This reflects common assumptions about the additional information in normal forms despite standard bifurcation theorems being formulated only in terms of topological equivalence.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We propose a mathematical theory of acoustic wave scattering in one-dimensional finite high-contrast media. The system considered is constituted of a finite alternance of high-contrast segments of arbitrary lengths and interdistances, called the “resonators,” and a background medium. We prove the existence of subwavelength resonances, which are the counterparts of the well-known Minnaert resonances in three-dimensional systems. One of the main contribution of the paper is to show that the resonant frequencies as well as the transmission and reflection properties of the system can be accurately predicted by a “capacitance” eigenvalue problem, analogously to the three-dimensional setting. Moreover, we discover new properties which are peculiar to the one-dimensional setting, notably the tridiagonal structure of the capacitance matrix as well as the fact that the first resonant frequency is always exactly zero, implying a low-pass filtering property of a one-dimensional chain of resonators. Numerical results considering different situations with [math] to [math] resonators are provided to support our mathematical analysis and to illustrate the various possibilities offered by high-contrast resonators to manipulate waves at subwavelength scales.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A problem for a nanosized penny-shaped material surface attached to the boundary of an elastic isotropic semi-space is considered. An axisymmetric normal traction is applied to a material surface. The surface is modeled using the Steigmann–Ogden form of surface energy. The problem is solved by using the Boussinesq potentials represented by the Hankel transforms of certain unknown functions. With the help of these functions, the problem can be reduced to a system of two singular integral equations. Two types of material surface tip boundary conditions are considered: free tip conditions and conditions with a compensated surface prestress term. The numerical solution of this system is obtained by expanding each unknown function into a series based on Chebyshev polynomials. Then the approximations of the unknown functions can be obtained from a system of linear algebraic equations. Accuracy of the numerical procedure is studied. Various numerical examples for different values of the surface energy parameters are considered. It is shown that both the surface parameters and the type of tip conditions have significant influence on the behavior of the material system.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Social insects are ecologically and evolutionarily the most successful organisms on earth and can achieve robust collective behaviors through local interactions among group members. Colony migration has been considered as a leading example of collective decision making in social insects. In this paper, a piecewise colony migration system with recruitment switching is proposed to explore underlying mechanisms and synergistic effects of colony size and quorum on the outcomes of collective decision. The dynamical behavior of the nonsmooth system is studied, and sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of equilibrium are provided. The theoretical results suggest that large colonies are more likely to emigrate to a new site. More interesting findings include but are not limited to that (a) the system may exhibit oscillation when the colony size is below a critical level and (b) the system may also exhibit a bistable state, i.e., the colony migrates to a new site or the old nest depending on the initial size of recruiters. Bifurcation analysis shows that the variations of colony size and quorum threshold greatly impact the dynamics. The results suggest that it is important to distinguish between two populations of recruiters in modeling. This work may provide important insights on how simple and local interactions achieve the collective migrating activity in social insects.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Cell-cell adhesion is one the most fundamental mechanisms regulating collective cell migration during tissue development, homeostasis, and repair, allowing cell populations to self-organize and eventually form and maintain complex tissue shapes. Cells interact with each other via the formation of protrusions or filopodia and they adhere to other cells through binding of cell surface proteins. The resulting adhesive forces are then related to cell size and shape and, often, continuum models represent them by nonlocal attractive interactions. In this paper, we present a new continuum model of cell-cell adhesion which can be derived from a general nonlocal model in the limit of short-range interactions. This new model is local, resembling a system of thin-film type equations, with the various model parameters playing the role of surface tensions between different cell populations. Numerical simulations in one and two dimensions reveal that the local model maintains the diversity of cell sorting patterns observed both in experiments and in previously used nonlocal models. In addition, it also has the advantage of having explicit stationary solutions, which provides a direct link between the model parameters and the differential adhesion hypothesis.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We give an algorithm for computing exact maximum flows on graphs with [math] edges and integer capacities in the range [math] in [math] time. We use [math] to suppress logarithmic factors in [math]. For sparse graphs with polynomially bounded integer capacities, this is the first improvement over the [math] time bound from Goldberg and Rao [J. ACM, 45 (1998), pp. 783–797]. Our algorithm revolves around dynamically maintaining the augmenting electrical flows at the core of the interior point method based algorithm from Ma̧dry [Proceedings of the 57th IEEE Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2016, pp. 593–602]. This entails designing data structures that, in limited settings, return edges with large electric energy in a graph undergoing resistance updates.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the complexity of isomorphism problems for tensors, groups, and polynomials. These problems have been studied in multivariate cryptography, machine learning, quantum information, and computational group theory. We show that these problems are all polynomial-time equivalent, creating bridges between problems traditionally studied in myriad research areas. This prompts us to define the complexity class [math], namely problems that reduce to the tensor isomorphism problem in polynomial time. Our main technical result is a polynomial-time reduction from [math]-tensor isomorphism to 3-tensor isomorphism. In the context of quantum information, this result gives a multipartite-to-tripartite entanglement transformation procedure that preserves equivalence under stochastic local operations and classical communication.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We determine the computational complexity of approximately counting and sampling independent sets of a given size in bounded-degree graphs. That is, we identify a critical density [math] and provide (i) for [math] randomized polynomial-time algorithms for approximately sampling and counting independent sets of given size at most [math] in [math]-vertex graphs of maximum degree [math], and (ii) a proof that unless NP = RP, no such algorithms exist for [math]. The critical density is the occupancy fraction of the hard-core model on the complete graph [math] at the uniqueness threshold on the infinite [math]-regular tree, giving [math] as [math]. Our methods apply more generally to antiferromagnetic 2-spin systems and motivate new questions in extremal combinatorics.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We prove that for every decision tree, the absolute values of the Fourier coefficients of a given order [math] sum to at most [math], where [math] is the number of variables, [math] is the tree depth, and [math] is an absolute constant. This bound is essentially tight and settles a conjecture due to Tal [Towards optimal separations between quantum and randomized query complexities, in Proceedings of the Sixty-First Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2020, pp. 228–239]. The bounds prior to our work degraded rapidly with [math], becoming trivial already at [math]. As an application, we obtain, for every integer [math], a partial Boolean function on [math] bits that has bounded-error quantum query complexity at most [math] and randomized query complexity [math]. This separation of bounded-error quantum versus randomized query complexity is best possible, by the results of Aaronson and Ambainis [SIAM J. Comput., 47 (2018), pp. 982–1038] and Bravyi et al. [Classical Algorithms for Forrelation, arXiv preprint, 2021]. Prior to our work, the best known separation was polynomially weaker: [math] versus [math] for any [math] [A. Tal, Towards optimal separations between quantum and randomized query complexities, in Proceedings of the Sixty-First Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2020, pp. 228–239]. As another application, we obtain an essentially optimal separation of [math] versus [math] for bounded-error quantum versus randomized communication complexity for any [math]. The best previous separation was polynomially weaker: [math] versus [math] (this is implicit in [A. Tal, Towards optimal separations between quantum and randomized query complexities, in Proceedings of the Sixty-First Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2020, pp. 228–239]).]]></summary>

 Abstract. This is the second paper in a series in which we develop machine learning (ML) moment closure models for the radiative transfer equation (RTE). In our previous work [J. Huang, Y. Cheng, A. J. Christlieb, and L. F. Roberts, J. Comput. Phys., 453 (2022), 110941], we proposed an approach to directly learn the spatial gradient of the unclosed high-order moment, which performs much better than learning the moment itself and the conventional [math] closure. However, the ML moment closure model in [J. Huang, Y. Cheng, A. J. Christlieb, and L. F. Roberts, J. Comput. Phys., 453 (2022), 110941] is not able to guarantee hyperbolicity and long time stability. We propose in this paper a method to enforce the global hyperbolicity of the ML closure model. The main idea is to seek a symmetrizer (a symmetric positive definite matrix) for the closure system and derive constraints such that the system is globally symmetrizable hyperbolic. It is shown that the new ML closure system inherits the dissipativeness of the RTE and preserves the correct diffusion limit as the Knudsen number goes to zero. Several benchmark tests including the Gaussian source problem and the two-material problem show the good accuracy, long time stability, and generalizability of our globally hyperbolic ML closure model.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Reaction coordinates (RCs) are indicators of hidden, low-dimensional mechanisms that govern the long-term behavior of high-dimensional stochastic processes. We present a novel and general variational characterization of optimal RCs and provide conditions for their existence. Optimal RCs are minimizers of a certain loss function, and reduced models based on them guarantee a good approximation of the statistical long-term properties of the original high-dimensional process. We show that for slow-fast systems, metastable systems, and other systems with known good RCs, the novel theory reproduces previous insight. Remarkably, for reversible systems, the numerical effort required to evaluate the loss function scales only with the variability of the underlying, low-dimensional mechanism, and not with that of the full system. The theory provided lays the foundation for an efficient and data-sparse computation of RCs via modern machine learning techniques.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Networks with absolute concentration robustness (ACR) have the property that a translation of a coordinate hyperplane either contains all steady states (static ACR) or attracts all trajectories (dynamic ACR). The implication for the underlying biological system is robustness in the concentration of one of the species independent of the initial conditions as well as independent of the concentration of all other species. Identifying network conditions for dynamic ACR is a challenging problem. We lay the groundwork in this paper by studying small reaction networks, those with two reactions and two species. We give a complete classification by ACR properties of these minimal reaction networks. The dynamics are rich even within this simple setting. Insights obtained from this work will help illuminate the properties of more complex networks with dynamic ACR.]]></summary>

We introduce a numerical methodology, referred to as the transport-based mesh-free method, which allows us to deal with continuous, discrete, or statistical models in the same unified framework, and leads us to a broad class of numerical algorithms recently implemented in a Python library (namely, CodPy). Specifically, we propose a mesh-free discretization technique based on the theory of reproducing kernels and the theory of transport mappings, in a way that is reminiscent of Lagrangian methods in computational fluid dynamics. We introduce kernel-based discretizations of a variety of differential and discrete operators (gradient, divergence, Laplacian, Leray projection, extrapolation, interpolation, polar factorization). The proposed algorithms are nonlinear in nature and enjoy quantitative error estimates based on the notion of discrepancy error, which allows one to evaluate the relevance and accuracy of, both, the given data and the numerical solutions. Our strategy is relevant when a large number of degrees of freedom are present as is the case in mathematical finance and machine learning. We consider the Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov system (relevant for problems arising in finance and material dynamics) and a class of neural networks based on support vector machines.]]></summary>

In this paper we consider a steady phase change problem for non-isothermal incompressible viscous flow in porous media with an enthalpy-porosity-viscosity coupling mechanism, and introduce and analyze a Banach spaces-based variational formulation yielding a new mixed-primal finite element method for its numerical solution. The momentum and mass conservation equations are formulated in terms of velocity and the tensors of strain rate, vorticity, and stress; and the incompressibility constraint is used to eliminate the pressure, which is computed afterwards by a postprocessing formula depending on the stress and the velocity. The resulting continuous formulation for the flow becomes a nonlinear perturbation of a perturbed saddle point linear system. The energy conservation equation is written as a nonlinear primal formulation that incorporates the additional unknown of boundary heat flux. The whole mixed-primal formulation is regarded as a fixed-point operator equation, so that its well-posedness hinges on Banach’s theorem, along with smallness assumptions on the data. In turn, the solvability analysis of the uncoupled problem in the fluid employs the Babuška–Brezzi theory, a recently obtained result for perturbed saddle-point problems, and the Banach–Nečas–Babuška Theorem, all them in Banach spaces, whereas the one for the uncoupled energy equation applies a nonlinear version of the Babuška–Brezzi theory in Hilbert spaces. An analogue fixed-point strategy is employed for the analysis of the associated Galerkin scheme, using in this case Brouwer’s theorem and assuming suitable conditions on the respective discrete subspaces. The error analysis is conducted under appropriate assumptions, and selecting specific finite element families that fit the theory. We finally report on the verification of theoretical convergence rates with the help of numerical examples.]]></summary>

The TENO-family schemes (Fu et al. in J Comput Phys 305: 333–359, 2016) have been demonstrated to perform well for compressible gas dynamics and turbulent flow predictions on structured meshes. However, the extension of the TENO schemes to unstructured meshes is non-trivial and challenging, particularly when the multiple design objectives are pursued simultaneously, i.e., restoring the high-order accuracy in smooth regions, retaining the low numerical dissipation for small-scale features, maintaining the sharp shock-capturing property, and featuring the good numerical robustness for high-Mach flows. In this work, a family of very-high-order (up to seventh-order accuracy) robust finite-volume TENO schemes with dual ENO-like stencil selection for unstructured meshes is proposed. The…]]></summary>

Numerically solving the Boltzmann equation is computationally expensive in part due to the number of variables the distribution function depends upon. Another contributor to the complexity of the Boltzmann Equation is the quadratic collision operator describing changes in the distribution function due to colliding particle pairs. Solving it as efficiently as possible has been a topic of recent research, e.g. Cai and Torrilhon (Phys Fluids 31(12):126105, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5127114), Wang and Cai (J Comput Phys 397:108815, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2019.07.014), Cai et al. (Comput Fluids 200:104456, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compfluid.2020.104456). In this paper we exploit results from representation theory to find a very efficient algorithm both in terms of memory and computational time for the evaluation of the quadratic collision operator. With this novel approach we are also able to provide a meaningful interpretation of its structure.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The long time behavior of a kind of fully magnetic effected piezoelectric system is considered. The impact of the presence of only one friction-type infinite memory term on the stability of the piezoelectric coupled plate is investigated. By introducing the so called “minimal state variable” and using semigroup theories, the system is proved to be well-posed. It is found that this kind of memory term still acts as a damping to some extent under certain conditions, but its damping effect is too weak to indirectly stabilize the system exponentially. Based on frequency domain analysis, it is further proved that this system can be indirectly stabilized polynomially by only one friction-type infinite memory term located on one of these strongly coupled PDEs. Especially, the optimality of this decay rate is also further verified by detailed spectral analysis for the system operator.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow with a common noise on the density manifold of a finite graph. Under the framework of the stochastic variational principle, we first develop the formulation of stochastic Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow and show the local existence of a unique solution. We also establish a sufficient condition for the global existence of the solution. Consequently, we obtain the global well-posedness for the nonlinear Schrödinger equations with common noise on a graph. In addition, using Wong–Zakai approximation of common noise, we prove the existence of the minimizer for an optimal control problem with common noise. We show that its minimizer satisfies the stochastic Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow on a graph as well.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
In this paper, we propose a semi-discrete first-order low regularity exponential-type integrator (LREI) for the “good” Boussinesq equation. It is shown that the method is convergent linearly in the space 
                      
                      \(H^r\)
                      
                     for solutions belonging to 
                      
                      \(H^{r+p(r)}\)
                      
                     where 
                      
                      \(0\le p(r)\le 1\)
                      
                     is non-increasing with respect to r, which means less additional derivatives might be needed when the numerical solution is measured in a more regular space. Particularly, the LREI presents the first-order accuracy in 
                      
                      \(H^{r}\)
                      
                     with no assumptions of additional derivatives when 
                      
                      \(r>5/2\)
                      
                    . This is the first time to propose a low regularity method which achieves the optimal first-order accuracy without loss of regularity for the GB equation. The convergence is confirmed by extensive numerical experiments.]]></summary>
