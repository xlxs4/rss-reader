 Abstract. The purpose of this note is to establish two continuum theories for the bending and torsion of inextensible rods as [math]-limits of three-dimensional atomistic models. In our derivation we study simultaneous limits of vanishing rod thickness [math] and interatomic distance [math]. First, we set up a novel theory for ultrathin rods composed of finitely many atomic fibers ([math]), which incorporates surface energy and new discrete terms in the limiting functional. This can be thought of as a contribution to the mechanical modelling of nanowires. Second, we treat the case where [math] and recover a nonlinear rod model—the modern version of Kirchhoff’s rod theory.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This work presents a systematic methodology for describing the transient dynamics of coarse-grained molecular systems inferred from all-atom simulated data. We suggest Langevin-type dynamics where the coarse-grained interaction potential depends explicitly on time to efficiently approximate the transient coarse-grained dynamics. We apply the path-space force matching approach at the transient dynamics regime to learn the proposed model parameters. In particular, we parameterize the coarse-grained potential both with respect to the pair distance of the coarse-grained particles and the time, and we obtain an evolution model that is explicitly time dependent. Moreover, we follow a data-driven approach to estimate the friction kernel, given by appropriate correlation functions directly from the underlying all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. To explore and validate the proposed methodology we study a benchmark system of a moving particle in a box. We examine the suggested model’s effectiveness in terms of the system’s correlation time and find that the model can well approximate the transient time regime of the system, depending on the correlation time of the system. As a result, in the less correlated case, it can represent the dynamics for a longer time interval. We present an extensive study of our approach to a realistic high-dimensional water molecular system. Posing the water system initially out of thermal equilibrium we collect trajectories of all-atom data for the, empirically estimated, transient time regime. Then, we infer the suggested model and strengthen the model’s validity by comparing it with simplified Markovian models.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We investigate an optimal control model with pointwise constraints governed by a two-time-scale time-fractional advection-diffusion-reaction equation with space-time-dependent fractional order and coefficients, which describes, e.g., the contaminant in groundwater under various transport scales or miscible displacement of hydrocarbon by injected fluid through heterogeneous porous media. To accommodate for the effects of complex fractional order and coefficients, an auxiliary equation method is proposed, along with the Fredholm alternative for compact operators, to analyze the well-posedness of the state equation. Additionally, a bootstrapping argument is utilized to progressively improve the solution regularity through a carefully designed pathway, leading to the maximal regularity estimates. Subsequently, we analyze the adjoint equation derived from the first-order optimality condition, which requires more subtle treatments due to the presence of hidden-memory variable-order fractional operators. Based on these findings, we ultimately analyze the well-posedness, first-order optimality conditions and maximal regularity estimates for the optimal control problem, and we conduct numerical experiments to investigate its behavior in potential applications.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The rocking can problem [M. Srinivasan and A. Ruina, Phys. Rev. E, 78 (2008), 066609] consists of an empty drinks can standing upright on a horizontal plane which, when tipped back to a single contact point and released, rocks down towards the flat and level state. At the bottom of the motion, the contact point moves quickly around the rim of the can. The can then rises up again, having rotated through some finite angle of turn [math]. We recast the problem as a second order ODE and find a Frobenius solution. We then use this Frobenius solution to derive a reduced equation of motion. The rocking can exhibits two distinct phenomena: behavior very similar to an inverted pendulum, and dynamics with the angle of turn. This distinction allows us to use matched asymptotic expansions to derive a uniformly valid solution that is in excellent agreement with numerical calculations of the reduced equation of motion. The solution of the inner problem was used to investigate of the angle of turn phenomenon. We also examine the motion of the contact locus [math] and see a range of different trajectories, from circular to petaloid motion and even cusp-like behavior. Finally, we obtain an approximate lower bound for the required coefficient of friction to avoid slip.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A semianalytical method is derived for finding the existence and stability of single-impact periodic orbits born in a boundary equilibrium bifurcation in a general [math]-dimensional impacting hybrid system. Known results are reproduced for planar systems and general formulae derived for three-dimensional (3D) systems. A numerical implementation of the method is illustrated for several 3D examples and for an 8D wing-flap model that shows coexistence of attractors. It is shown how the method can easily be embedded within numerical continuation, and some remarks are made about necessary and sufficient conditions in arbitrary dimensional systems.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We present an effective model of “space-coiled metacrystals” composed of a periodic array of sound rigid blocks into which long slots have been coiled up. The periodic cell of the block contains a coiled slot whose straight parts are at wavelength scale, which enables the appearance of Bragg resonances. These resonances, which prevent high transmission, compete with the Fabry–Pérot resonances of the entire slot, which foster perfect transmission. This results in complex scattering properties driven by the characteristics of the turning regions that act as atoms in a one-dimensional coiled crystal. Using appropriate scaling and combining two-scale homogenization with matched asymptotic techniques, the modeling of such metacrystals is proposed. The resulting model is validated through a comparison with full-wave numerics in both harmonic and transient regimes.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We prove a general structural theorem for a wide family of local algorithms, which includes property testers, local decoders, and probabilistically checkable proofs of proximity. Namely, we show that the structure of every algorithm that makes [math] adaptive queries and satisfies a natural robustness condition admits a sample-based algorithm with [math] sample complexity, following the definition of Goldreich and Ron [ACM Trans. Comput. Theory, 8 (2016), 7]. We prove that this transformation is nearly optimal. Our theorem also admits a scheme for constructing privacy-preserving local algorithms. Using the unified view that our structural theorem provides, we obtain results regarding various types of local algorithms, including the following. We strengthen the state-of-the-art lower bound for relaxed locally decodable codes, obtaining an exponential improvement on the dependency in query complexity; this resolves an open problem raised by Gur and Lachish [SIAM J. Comput., 50 (2021), pp. 788–813]. We show that any (constant-query) testable property admits a sample-based tester with sublinear sample complexity; this resolves a problem left open in a work of Fischer, Lachish, and Vasudev [Proceedings of the 56th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE, 2015, pp. 1163–1182], bypassing an exponential blowup caused by previous techniques in the case of adaptive testers. We prove that the known separation between proofs of proximity and testers is essentially maximal; this resolves a problem left open by Gur and Rothblum [Proceedings of the 8th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference, 2017, pp. 39:1–39:43; Comput. Complexity, 27 (2018), pp. 99–207] regarding sublinear-time delegation of computation. Our techniques strongly rely on relaxed sunflower lemmas and the Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The intention of this article is to illustrate the use of methods from symplectic geometry for practical purposes. Our intended audience is scientists interested in orbits of Hamiltonian systems (e.g., the three-body problem). The main directions pursued in this article are as follows: (1) given two periodic orbits, decide when they can be connected by a regular family of periodic orbits; (2) use numerical invariants from Floer theory which help predict the existence of orbits in the presence of a bifurcation; (3) attach a sign [math] to each elliptic or hyperbolic Floquet multiplier of a closed symmetric orbit, which generalizes the classical Krein–Moser sign to also include the hyperbolic case; and (4) do all of the above in a visual, easily implementable, and resource-efficient way. The mathematical framework is provided by the first and third authors in [U. Frauenfelder and A. Moreno, J. Symplectic Geom., to appear], where, as it turns out, the “Broucke stability diagram” [R. Broucke, AIAA J., 7 (1969), pp. 1003–1009] was rediscovered, but further refined with the above signs and algebraically reformulated in terms of quotients of the symplectic group. The advantage of the framework is that it applies to the study of closed orbits of an arbitrary Hamiltonian system. We will carry out numerical work based on the cell-mapping method as described in [D. Koh, R. L. Anderson, and I. Bermejo-Moreno, J. Astronautical Sci., 68 (2021), pp. 172–196] for the Jupiter-Europa and Saturn-Enceladus systems. These are currently systems of interest, falling in the agenda of space agencies like NASA, as these icy moons are considered candidates for harboring conditions suitable for extraterrestrial life.]]></summary>

In the case where the domain is radial and the underlying parameters are constant, we give rigorous justifications and derive a thorough understanding of those intriguing geometric and physical patterns. We also present numerical examples to verify that the same results hold in general geometric and parameter setups.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, a coupled electro-calcium model was developed and implemented to computationally explore the effects of neuronal synapse loss, in particular in the context of Alzheimer’s disease. Established parameters affected by Alzheimer’s disease, such as synapse loss, calcium leaks at deteriorating synaptic contacts, and downregulation of the calcium buffer calbindin, are subject to this study. Reconstructed neurons are used to define the computational domain for a system of PDEs and ODEs, discretized by finite differences and solved with a semi-implicit second-order time integrator. The results show neuronal resilience during synapse loss. When incorporating calcium leaks at affected synapses, neurons lose their ability to produce synapse-to-nucleus calcium signals, necessary for learning, plasticity, and neuronal survival. Downregulation of calbindin concentrations partially recovers the signaling pathway to the cell nucleus. These results could define future research pathways toward stabilizing the calcium signaling pathways during Alzheimer’s disease. The coupled electro-calcium model was implemented and solved using MATLAB https://github.com/NeuroBox3D/CalcSim.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The aim of this article is to advance the field of metamaterials by proposing formulas for the design of high-contrast metamaterials with prescribed subwavelength defect mode eigenfrequencies. This is achieved in two settings: (i) design of non-Hermitian static materials and (ii) design of instantly changing non-Hermitian time-dependent materials. The design of static materials is achieved via characterizing equations for the defect mode eigenfrequencies in the setting of a defected dimer material. These characterizing equations are the basis for obtaining formulas for the material parameters of the defect which admit given defect mode eigenfrequencies. Explicit formulas are provided in the setting of one and two given defect mode eigenfrequencies in the setting of a defected chain of dimers. In the time-dependent case, we first analyze the influence of time boundaries on the subwavelength solutions. We find that subwavelength solutions are preserved if and only if the material parameters satisfy a temporal Snell’s law across the time boundary. The same result also identifies the change of the time frequencies uniquely. Combining this result with those on the design of static materials, we obtain an explicit formula for the material design of instantly changing defected dimer materials which admit subwavelength modes with prescribed time-dependent defect mode eigenfrequency. Finally, we use this formula to create materials which admit spatio-temporally localized defect modes.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this work, we propose and study a preconditioned framework with a graphic Ginzburg–Landau functional for image segmentation and data clustering by parallel computing. Solving nonlocal models is usually challenging due to the huge computation burden. For the nonconvex and nonlocal variational functional, we propose several damped Jacobi and generalized Richardson preconditioners for the large-scale linear systems within a difference of convex functions algorithm framework. These preconditioners are efficient for parallel computing with GPU and can leverage the computational cost. Our framework also provides flexible step sizes with a global convergence guarantee. Numerical experiments show the proposed algorithms are very competitive compared to the singular value decomposition based spectral method.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We prove that the Kuramoto model on a graph can contain infinitely many nonequivalent stable equilibria. More precisely, we prove that for every [math] there is a connected graph such that the set of stable equilibria contains a manifold of dimension [math]. In particular, we solve a conjecture of Delabays, Coletta, and Jacquod about the number of equilibria on planar graphs. Our results are based on the analysis of balanced configurations, which correspond to equilateral polygon linkages in topology. In order to analyze the stability of manifolds of equilibria we apply topological bifurcation theory.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Inspired by applications, we study the effect of interface slip on the effective wave propagation in poroelastic materials, which are composites consisting of elastic frames whose pore space is filled with fluid. The current literature on the homogenization for the poroelastic wave equations are all based on the no-slip interface condition posed on the microscale. However, for certain pore fluids, the no-slip condition is known to be physically invalid. In the literature, slip boundary conditions have been considered for porous materials with rigid solid frames. For these rigid porous materials, the wave can only propagate in the pore fluid and hence the equations for the microscale are posed only in the pore space. Consequently, the slip on the interface involves only the fluid velocity and the fluid stress. In contrast, for poroelastic materials, the wave can propagate not only in the pore fluid but also in the solid frame; hence the slip conditions involve the velocities on both sides of the interface, rather than just the fluid side. With this slip condition, a variational boundary value problem governing the small vibrations of a periodic mixture of an elastic solid and a slightly viscous fluid is studied in this paper. The method of two-scale convergence is used to obtain the macroscopic behavior of the solution and to identify the role played by the slip interface condition.]]></summary>

In this paper, the convex-splitting BDF2 method with variable time-steps (proposed in Chen et al. SIAM J Numer Anal 57:495–525, 2019) is reconsidered for the Cahn–Hilliard model. We adopt the Fourier pseudo-spectral discretization in space. With the help of the discrete gradient structure of the BDF2 formula and some embedded inequalities, we prove that the scheme preserves a modified energy dissipation law under the updated time-step-ratio restriction 
                      
                      \(0<r_{k}=\tau _{k}/\tau _{k-1}<4.864\)
                      
                    . By utilizing the discrete orthogonal convolution kernels, some discrete convolution inequalities and some proof techniques (Lemma 4.6), we tackle the difficulty brought from the Douglas-Dupont regularization stabilized term and prove the robust

                     Numerical experiments are carried out to support our theoretical analysis and a time adaptive strategy is applied to accelerate the simulation of the multi-scale characteristics of the Cahn–Hilliard model.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Mathematical models come in many forms across biological applications. In the case of complex, spatial dynamics and pattern formation, stochastic models also face two main challenges: pattern data are largely qualitative, and model realizations may vary significantly. Together these issues make it difficult to relate models and empirical data—or even models and models—limiting how different approaches can be combined to offer new insights into biology. These challenges also raise mathematical questions about how models are related, since alternative approaches to the same problem—e.g., Cellular Potts models; off-lattice, agent-based models; on-lattice, cellular automaton models; and continuum approaches—treat uncertainty and implement cell behavior in different ways. To help open the door to future work on questions like these, here we adapt methods from topological data analysis and computational geometry to quantitatively relate two different models of the same biological process in a fair, comparable way. To center our work and illustrate concrete challenges, we focus on the example of zebrafish-skin pattern formation, and we relate patterns that arise from agent-based and cellular automaton models.]]></summary>

 Abstract. How morphogenesis depends on cell properties is an active direction of research. Here, we focus on mechanical models of growing plant tissues, where microscopic (sub)cellular structure is taken into account. In order to establish links between microscopic and macroscopic tissue properties, we perform a multiscale analysis of a model of growing plant tissue with subcellular resolution. We use homogenization to rigorously derive the corresponding macroscopic tissue-scale model. Tissue-scale mechanical properties are computed from microscopic structural and material properties, taking into account deformation by the growth field. We then consider case studies and numerically compare the detailed microscopic model and the tissue-scale model, both implemented using the finite element method. We find that the macroscopic model can be used to efficiently make predictions about several configurations of interest. Our work will help making links between microscopic measurements and macroscopic observations in growing tissues.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In the Bin Packing problem one is given [math] items with weights [math] and [math] bins with capacities [math]. The goal is to partition the items into sets [math] such that [math] for every bin [math], where [math] denotes [math]. Björklund, Husfeldt, and Koivisto [SIAM J. Comput., 39 (2009), pp. 546–563] presented an [math] time algorithm for Bin Packing (the [math] notation omits factors polynomial in the input size). In this paper, we show that for every [math] there exists a constant [math] such that an instance of Bin Packing with [math] bins can be solved in [math] randomized time. Before our work, such improved algorithms were not known even for [math]. A key step in our approach is the following new result in Littlewood–Offord theory on the additive combinatorics of subset sums: For every [math] there exists an [math] such that if [math] for some [math], then [math].]]></summary>

 Abstract. In an epidemic network, lags due to travel time between populations, latent period, and recovery period can significantly change the epidemic behavior and result in successive echoing waves of the spread between various population clusters. Moreover, external shocks to a given population can propagate to other populations within the network, potentially snowballing into waves of resurgent epidemics. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of time delay and small shocks/uncertainties on the linear susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) dynamics of epidemic networks. In this regard, the asymptotic stability of this class of networks is first studied, and then its …]]></summary>

 Abstract.The deep linear network (DLN) is a model for implicit regularization in gradient based optimization of overparametrized learning architectures. Training the DLN corresponds to a Riemannian gradient flow, where the Riemannian metric is defined by the architecture of the network and the loss function is defined by the learning task. We extend this geometric framework, obtaining explicit expressions for the volume form, including the case when the network has infinite depth. We investigate the link between the Riemannian geometry and the training asymptotics for matrix completion with rigorous analysis and numerics. We propose that under small initialization, implicit regularization is a result of bias towards high state space volume.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Social interactions often occur between three or more agents simultaneously. Examining opinion dynamics on hypergraphs allows one to study the effect of such polyadic interactions on the opinions of agents. In this paper, we consider a bounded-confidence model (BCM), in which opinions take continuous values and interacting agents comprise their opinions if they are close enough to each other. We study a density description of a Deffuant–Weisbuch BCM on hypergraphs. We derive a rate equation for the mean-field opinion density as the number of agents becomes infinite, and we prove that this rate equation yields a probability density that converges to noninteracting opinion clusters. Using numerical simulations, we examine bifurcations of the density-based BCM’s steady-state opinion clusters and demonstrate that the agent-based BCM converges to the density description of the BCM as the number of agents becomes infinite.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Many networked systems are governed by non-pairwise interactions between nodes. The resulting higher-order interaction structure can then be encoded by means of a hypernetwork. In this paper we consider dynamical systems on hypernetworks by defining a class of admissible maps for every such hypernetwork. We explain how to classify robust cluster synchronization patterns on hypernetworks by finding balanced partitions, and we generalize the concept of a graph fibration to the hypernetwork context. We also show that robust synchronization patterns are only fully determined by polynomial admissible maps of high order. This means that, unlike in dyadic networks, cluster synchronization on hypernetworks is a higher-order, i.e., nonlinear, effect. We give a formula, in terms of the order of the hypernetwork, for the degree of the polynomial admissible maps that determine robust synchronization patterns. We also demonstrate that this degree is optimal by investigating a class of examples. We conclude by demonstrating how this effect may cause remarkable synchrony breaking bifurcations that occur at high polynomial degree.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The constructive theory of analytical higher-order contrast bounds for the effective constants of dispersed conducting and piezoelectric fibrous composites is developed. The lower-order bounds, e.g., Wiener and Hashin–Shtrikman bounds, are universal for composites but do not take into account interactions among inclusions corresponding to their location. To study the variety of dispersed random composites, we use computationally effective structural sums directly relating the location of inclusions to the effective constants. The present paper is the first report where the structural sums are applied to higher-order contrast bounds instead of the virtually impossible in computation multipoint correlation functions. We concentrate our attention on two-phase conducting fibrous composites. Rylko’s matrix decomposition is used for the higher-order contrast bounds to extend the obtained analytical bounds to piezoelectric fibrous composites. The supplementary materials contain the results of numerical-symbolic computations, the long analytical formulas for the effective constants and bounds up to [math], where [math] stands for concentration.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study order reconstruction (OR) solutions in the Beris–Edwards framework for nematodynamics, for both passive and active nematic flows in a microfluidic channel. OR solutions exhibit polydomains and domain walls, and as such, are of physical interest. We show that OR solutions exist for passive flows with constant velocity and pressure, but only for specific boundary conditions. We prove the existence of unique, symmetric, and nonsingular nematic profiles for boundary conditions that do not allow for OR solutions. We compute asymptotic expansions for OR-type solutions for passive flows with nonconstant velocity and pressure, and active flows, which shed light on the internal structure of domain walls. The asymptotics are complemented by numerical studies that demonstrate the universality of OR-type structures in static and dynamic scenarios.]]></summary>

The fully-connected tensor network (FCTN) decomposition is an emerging method for processing and analyzing higher-order tensors. For an Nth-order tensor, the standard deterministic algorithms, such as alternating least squares (FCTN-ALS) algorithm, need to store large coefficient matrices formed by contracting 
                      
                      \(N-1\)
                      
                     FCTN factor tensors. The memory cost of coefficient matrices grows exponentially with the size of the original tensor, which makes the algorithms memory-prohibitive for handling large-scale tensors. To enable FCTN decomposition to handle large-scale tensors effectively, we propose a stochastic gradient descent (FCTN-SGD) algorithm without sacrificing accuracy. The memory cost of FCTN-SGD algorithm grows linearly with the size of the original tensor and is significantly lower than that of the FCTN-ALS algorithm. The success of the FCTN-SGD algorithm lies in the suggested factor sampling operator, which cleverly avoids storing large coefficient matrices in the algorithm. By using the suggested operator, sampling on small factor tensors is equal to sampling on large coefficient matrices with a theoretical guarantee. Furthermore, we present an FCTN-VRSGD algorithm by introducing variance reduction into the FCTN-SGD algorithm, and theoretically prove the convergence of the FCTN-VRSGD algorithm under a mild assumption. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed FCTN-SGD and FCTN-VRSGD algorithms, especially for real-world large-scale tensors.]]></summary>

Inverse obstacle scattering is the recovery of an obstacle boundary from the scattering data produced by incident waves. This shape recovery can be done by iteratively solving a PDE-constrained optimization problem for the obstacle boundary. While it is well known that this problem is typically non-convex and ill-posed, previous investigations have shown that in many settings these issues can be alleviated by using a continuation-in-frequency method and introducing a regularization that limits the frequency content of the obstacle boundary. It has been recently observed that these techniques can fail for obstacles with pronounced cavities, even in the case of penetrable obstacles where similar optimization and regularization methods work for the equivalent problem of recovering a piecewise constant wave speed. The present work investigates the recovery of obstacle boundaries for impenetrable, sound-soft media with pronounced cavities, given multi-frequency scattering data. Numerical examples demonstrate that the problem is sensitive to the choice of iterative solver used at each frequency and the initial guess at the lowest frequency. We propose a modified continuation-in-frequency method which follows a random walk in frequency, as opposed to the standard monotonically increasing path. This method shows some increased robustness in recovering cavities, but can also fail for more extreme examples. An interesting phenomenon is observed that while the obstacle reconstructions obtained over several random trials can vary significantly near the cavity, the results are consistent for non-cavity parts of the boundary.]]></summary>

It has long been known that second order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equations with nonoscillatory coefficients admit nonoscillatory phase functions. This observation is the basis of many techniques for the asymptotic approximation of the solutions of such equations, as well as several schemes for their numerical solution. However, it was only relatively recently exploited to develop the first high-accuracy numerical solver for second order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equations which runs in time independent of frequency. Here, we introduce the first high-accuracy, frequency-independent method for the numerical solution of second order linear inhomogeneous ordinary differential equations. Our algorithm operates by constructing a nonoscillatory phase function representing the solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equation. Then, it uses an adaptive Levin scheme to construct a collection of auxiliary nonoscillatory functions that efficiently represent a highly oscillatory indefinite integral giving a particular solution of the inhomogeneous differential equation. Once the phase function and these auxiliary functions have been constructed, the inhomogeneous equation can be solved subject to essentially any reasonable boundary conditions. The results of numerical experiments illustrating the properties of our scheme are discussed.]]></summary>

We investigate the use of models from the theory of regularity structures as features in machine learning tasks. A model is a polynomial function of a space–time signal designed to well-approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), even in low regularity regimes. Models can be seen as natural multi-dimensional generalisations of signatures of paths; our work therefore aims to extend the recent use of signatures in data science beyond the context of time-ordered data. We provide a flexible definition of a model feature vector associated to a space–time signal, along with two algorithms which illustrate ways in which these features can be combined with linear regression. We apply these algorithms in several numerical experiments designed to learn solutions to PDEs with a given forcing and boundary data. Our experiments include semi-linear parabolic and wave equations with forcing, and Burgers’ equation with no forcing. We find an advantage in favour of our algorithms when compared to several alternative methods. Additionally, in the experiment with Burgers’ equation, we find non-trivial predictive power when noise is added to the observations.]]></summary>
