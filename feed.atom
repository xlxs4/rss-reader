 Abstract. We consider the problem of determining the arrival statistics of unbiased planar random walkers to complex target configurations. In contrast to problems posed in finite domains, simple moments of the first passage time distribution, such as its mean and variance, are not defined. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain the full arrival statistics. We describe several methods to obtain these distributions and other associated quantities such as splitting probabilities. One approach combines a Laplace transform of the underlying parabolic equation with matched asymptotic analysis followed by numerical transform inversion. The second approach is similar but uses a boundary integral equation method to solve for the transformed variable. To validate the results of this theory, and to obtain the arrival time statistics in very general configurations of absorbers, we introduce an efficient kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method that describes trajectories as a combination of large but exactly solvable projection steps. The effectiveness of these methodologies is demonstrated on a variety of challenging examples highlighting the applicability of these methods to a variety of practical scenarios, such as source inference. A particularly useful finding arising from these results is that homogenization theories, in which complex configurations are replaced by equivalent simple ones, are remarkably effective at describing arrival time statistics.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Wolbachia is a natural bacterium that can infect mosquitoes and reduce their ability to transmit mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, Zika, and chikungunya. Field trials and modeling studies have shown that the fraction of infection among the mosquitoes must exceed a threshold level for the infection to persist. To capture this threshold, it is critical to consider the spatial heterogeneity in the distributions of the infected and uninfected mosquitoes created by a local release of the infected mosquitoes. We develop and analyze PDE models to study the invasion dynamics of Wolbachia infection among mosquitoes in the field. Our reaction-diffusion-type models account for the complex vertical transmission and the spatial mosquito dispersion. We characterize the threshold for a successful invasion with a bubble-shaped distribution, called the “critical bubble.” The critical bubble is optimal in its release size compared to other spatial profiles in a one-dimensional landscape. The fraction of infection near the release center is higher than the threshold level for the corresponding homogeneously mixing ODE models. We show that the proposed spatial models give rise to the traveling waves of Wolbachia infection when above the threshold. We quantify how the threshold condition and traveling-wave velocity depend on the diffusion coefficients and other model parameters. Numerical studies for different scenarios are presented to inform the design of release strategies.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Global dynamics of a Filippov susceptible, infectious, quarantine, and recovered model subject to delayed relay control are investigated in this work. The global stability of equilibria is obtained by means of the generalized Lyapunov method. In addition, combining the Poincaré maps, the displacement function, and a Melnikov-like method, we derive some sufficient conditions to ensure the existence, uniqueness, and global stability of a slowly oscillating periodic solution. Numerical simulations are performed to explore the effectiveness of the quarantine control measure and the effects of the delay.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Engineered consortia are a major research focus for synthetic biologists because they can implement sophisticated behaviors inaccessible to single-strain systems. However, this functional capacity is constrained by their constituent strains' ability to engage in complex communication. DNA messaging, by enabling information-rich channel-decoupled communication, is a promising candidate architecture for implementing complex communication. But its major advantage, its messages' dynamic mutability, is still unexplored. We develop a framework for addressable and adaptable DNA messaging that leverages all three of these advantages and implement it in a plasmid conjugation-based communication channel. Our system can bias the transfer of messages to targeted receiver strains by 100- to 1000-fold, and their recipient lists can be dynamically updated in situ to control the flow of information through the population. This work lays the foundation for future developments that further utilize the unique advantages of DNA messaging to engineer previously-inaccessible levels of complexity into biological systems.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to their photosynthetic capabilities, cyanobacteria is expected to be an ecologically friendly host for the production of biomaterials. However, compared to other bacteria, there is little information of autonomous replication sequences, and tools for genetic engineering, especially expression vector systems, are limited. In this study, we established an effective screening method, namely AR-seq (Autonomous Replication sequencing), for finding autonomous replication regions in cyanobacteria and utilized the region for constructing expression vector. AR-seq using the genomic library of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 revealed that a certain region containing Rep-related protein (here named as Cyanobacterial Rep protein A2: CyRepA2) exhibits high autonomous replication activity in a heterologous host cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. The reporter assay using GFP showed that the expression vector pYS carrying CyRepA2 can be maintained in a wide range of multiple cyanobacterial species, not only S. 6803 and S. 7942, but also Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. In S. 7942, the GFP expression in pYS-based system can be tightly regulated by IPTG, achieving 10-fold higher levels than that of chromosome-based system. Furthermore, pYS can be used together with conventional vector pEX, which was constructed from an endogenous plasmid in S. 7942. The combination of pYS with other vectors is useful for genetic engineering, such as modifying metabolic pathways, and is expected to improve the performance of cyanobacteria as bioproduction chassis.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Non-genetic factors can cause significant fluctuations in gene expression levels. Regardless of growing in a stable environment, this fluctuation leads to cell-to-cell variability in an isogenic population. This phenotypic heterogeneity allows a tiny subset of bacterial cells in a population, referred to as persister cells, to tolerate long-term lethal antibiotic effects by entering into a non-dividing, metabolically altered state. One fundamental question is whether this heterogeneous persister population is due to a pre-existing genetic mutation or a result of a transiently-primed reversible cell state. To explore this, we tested clonal populations starting from a single cell using a modified Luria-Delbruck fluctuation test. Through we kept the conditions the same, the diversity in persistence level among clones was relatively consistent: varying from [~]60-100 and [~]40-70 fold for ampicillin (Amp) and apramycin (Apr), respectively. Then we divided and diluted each clone to observe whether the same clone had comparable persister levels for more than one generation. Replicates had similar persister levels even when clones were divided, diluted by 1:20, and allowed to grow for [~]5 generations. This result explicitly shows a cellular memory passed on for generations and eventually lost when cells are diluted to 1:100 and regrown (>7 generations). Our result demonstrates 1) the existence of a small population prepared for stress ("primed cells") resulting in higher persister numbers, 2) the primed memory state is reproducible and transient, passed down for generations but eventually lost, and 3) a heterogeneous persister population is a result of a transiently-primed reversible cell state and not due to a pre-existing genetic mutation.]]></summary>

Because of their properties, pyocins are investigated as a potential new class of antimicrobials against Pseudomonas infections. Their production and modification, however, remains challenging. To address this limitation, we employed automated fast-flow peptide synthesis (AFPS) for the rapid production of a pyocin S2 import domain. The N-terminal domain sequence (PyS2NTD) was synthesized in under 10 hours and purified to yield milligrams quantities of the desired product. To our knowledge, the 217 amino acid sequence of PyS2NTD is among the longest peptides produced from a single-shot synthesis, i.e., made in a single stepwise route without the use of ligation techniques. Biophysical characterization of the PyS2NTD with circular dichroism was consistent with the literature reports. Fluorescently labeled PyS2NTD binds to P. aeruginosa expressing the cognate ferripyoverdine receptor (FpvA) and is taken up into the periplasm. This selective uptake was validated with confocal and super resolution microscopy, flow cytometry, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). These modified, synthetic S-type pyocins domains can be used to probe import mechanisms of P. aeruginosa and leveraged to develop selective antimicrobial agents that bypass the outer membrane.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A major challenge in biotechnology and biomanufacturing is the identification of a set of biomarkers for perturbations and metabolites of interest. Here, we develop a data-driven, transcriptome-wide approach to rank perturbation-inducible genes from time-series RNA sequencing data for the discovery of analyte-responsive promoters. This provides a set of biomarkers that act as a proxy for the transcriptional state referred to as cell state. We construct low-dimensional models of gene expression dynamics and rank genes by their ability to capture the perturbation-specific cell state using a novel observability analysis. Using this ranking, we extract 15 analyte-responsive promoters for the organophosphate malathion in the underutilized host organism Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25. We develop synthetic genetic reporters from each analyte-responsive promoter and characterize their response to malathion. Furthermore, we enhance malathion reporting through the aggregation of the response of individual reporters with a synthetic consortium approach, and we exemplify the library's ability to be useful outside the lab by detecting malathion in the environment. The library of living malathion sensors can be optimized for use in environmental diagnostics while the developed machine learning tool can be applied to discover perturbation-inducible gene expression systems in the compendium of host organisms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aliphatic ,{omega}-diamines (DAs) are important monomer precursors in polyamide plastic manufacturing. However, the dominant industrial process for DA synthesis involves energy-intensive, multistage chemical reactions that are harmful to the environment. For instance, 1,6-hexanediamine (HMD), one of most prominent monomers in nylon-66 synthesis, is mainly synthesized with currently high technological control by butadiene hydrocyanation, which suffers from the use of highly toxic hydrogen cyanide, unsatisfactory selectivity and a complex separation process. Thus, the development of sustainable green DA synthetic routes is highly desired. Herein, we report an efficient one-pot in vivo biocatalytic cascade for the transformation of cycloalkanes into DAs with the aid of advanced techniques, including the RetroBioCat tool for biocatalytic route design, enzyme mining for finding appropriate enzymes and microbial consortia construction for efficient pathway assembly. As a result, DAs are successfully produced by the developed microbial consortia-based biocatalytic system, especially HMD, and product concentrations as high as 16.5 mM and 7.6 mM are achieved when using cyclohexanol (CHOL) or cyclohexane (CH) as substrates, respectively. This also represents the highest HMD biosynthesis productivity to date. Other cycloalkanes also serve as substrates, indicating the generality of our approach.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In cell-free gene expression, low input DNA concentration severely limits the phenotypic output, which may impair in vitro protein evolution efforts. We address this challenge by developing CADGE, a strategy that is based on clonal isothermal amplification of a linear gene-encoding dsDNA template by the minimal {varphi}29 replication machinery and in situ transcription-translation. We demonstrate the utility of CADGE in bulk and in clonal liposome microcompartments to boost up the phenotypic output of soluble and membrane-associated proteins, as well as to facilitate the recovery of encapsulated DNA. Moreover, we report that CADGE enables the enrichment of a DNA variant from a mock gene library either via a positive feedback loop-based selection or high-throughput screening. This new biological tool can be implemented for cell-free protein engineering and the construction of a synthetic cell.]]></summary>

We present a programmable reaction-diffusion platform for designing protein oscillations, patterns, and circuits in mammalian cells using two bacterial proteins, MinD and MinE (MinDE). MinDE circuits act like "single-cell radios", emitting frequency-barcoded fluorescence signals that can be spectrally isolated and analyzed using digital signal processing tools. We define how to genetically program these signals and modulate their dynamics using engineerable protein-protein interactions. By connecting MinDE to endogenous cellular pathways, we built circuits that broadcast frequency-barcoded single-cell kinase activity or that synthetically pattern actin polymerization. Our work establishes a new paradigm for probing and engineering cellular activities at length and timescales critical for biological function.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Photosensory protein domains are the basis of optogenetic protein engineering. These domains originate from natural sources where they fulfill specific functions ranging from the protection against photooxidative damage to circadian rhythms. When used in synthetic biology, the features of these photosensory domains can be specifically tailored towards the application of interest, enabling their full exploitation for optogenetic regulation in basic research and applied bioengineering. In this work, we develop and apply a simple, yet powerful, directed evolution and high-throughput screening strategy that allows us to alter the most fundamental property of the widely used nMag/pMag photodimerization system: its light sensitivity. We identify a set of mutations located within the photosensory domains, which either increase or decrease the light sensitivity at sub-saturating light intensities, while also improving the dark-to-light fold change in certain variants. For some of these variants, photosensitivity and expression levels could be changed independently, showing that the shape of the light-activity dose-response curve can be tuned and adjusted. We functionally characterize the variants in vivo in bacteria on the single-cell and the population levels. We further show that a subset of these variants can be transferred into the mOptoT7 for gene expression regulation in mammalian cells. We demonstrate increased gene expression levels for low light intensities, resulting in reduced potential phototoxicity in long-term experiments. Our findings expand the applicability of the widely used Magnets photosensors by enabling a tuning towards the needs of specific optogenetic regulation strategies. More generally, our approach will aid optogenetic approaches by making the adaptation of photosensor properties possible to better suit specific experimental or bioprocess needs.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of circumstances under which wave dynamics can be fully reconstructed from sensor networks. We prove that, in many cases, wave dynamics can be fully reconstructed from a single sensor, but that such reconstructions can be sensitive to small perturbations in sensor placement. In general, multiple sensors are necessary, and we outline a procedure for reconstructing the dynamics from them. We also show that if a network of [math] sensors suffers from Gaussian noise, then the reconstruction error decreases as [math]. We illustrate and verify these results numerically by simulating wave dynamics and then reconstructing from sensor data the initial state of the system and time series of the system at randomly chosen locations.]]></summary>

Though synchronization of complex dynamical systems has been widely studied in the past few decades, few studies pay attention to the impact of network parameters on synchronization in hypernetworks. In this paper, we focus on a specific hypernetwork model consisting of coupled Rössler oscillators and investigate the impact of inner-coupling and time delay on the synchronized region (SR). For the sake of simplicity, the inner-coupling matrix is chosen from three typical forms, which result in classical bounded, unbounded, and empty SR in a single-layer network, respectively. The impact of inner-couplings or time delays on unbounded SR is the most interesting one among the three types of SR. Once the SR of one subnetwork is unbounded, the SR of the whole hypernetwork is also unbounded with a different inner-coupling matrix. In a hypernetwork with unbounded SR, the time delays change not only the size but also the type of SR. In a hypernetwork with bounded or empty SR, the time delays have almost no effect on the type of SR.]]></summary>

Homeostasis represents the idea that a feature may remain invariant despite changes in some external parameters. We establish a connection between homeostasis and injectivity for reaction network models. In particular, we show that a reaction network cannot exhibit homeostasis if a modified version of the network (which we call homeostasis-associated network) is injective. We provide examples of reaction networks which can or cannot exhibit homeostasis by analyzing the injectivity of their homeostasis-associated networks.]]></summary>

This paper derives a non-linear diffusion equation discussing two possible applications: the ionic diffusion in glasses and temperature-dependent conductivity in semiconductors. The first equation is a logarithmic diffusion derived formally from the continuity of ion concentration, but the latter is a more phenomenological example. A power-law ansatz with time-dependent parameters maximizes a non-standard entropy and gives a set of coupled motion equations we can solve analytically. These results build the general solution to the non-linear diffusion equation.]]></summary>

Systems consisting of confined, interacting particles doing overdamped motion admit an effective description in terms of nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations. The behavior of these systems is closely related to the [math] power-law entropies and can be interpreted in terms of the [math]-based thermostatistics. The connection between overdamped systems and the [math] measures provides valuable insights on diverse physical problems, such as the dynamics of interacting vortices in type-II superconductors. The [math]-thermostatistical approach to the study of many-body systems described by nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations has been intensively explored in recent years, but most of these efforts were restricted to systems affected by time-independent external potentials. Here, we extend this treatment to systems evolving under time-dependent external forces. We establish a lower bound on the work done by these forces when they drive the system during a transformation. The bound is expressed in terms of a free energy based on the [math] entropy and is satisfied even if the driving forces are not derivable from a potential function. It constitutes a generalization, for systems governed by nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations involving general time-dependent external forces, of the [math]-theorem satisfied by these systems when the external forces arise from a time-independent potential.]]></summary>

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) interacts with the immune cells within the human body, where the environment is uncertain and noisy. Stochastic models can successfully encapsulate the effect of such a noisy environment compared to their deterministic counterparts. The human immune system is complex but well-coordinated with various immune cells like [math]T cells, dendritic cells, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) cells, among many others. The CTL can kill the antigenic cells after its recognition. However, the efficacy of CTL in removing the infected [math]T cells is progressively compromised in HIV-infected individuals. This paper considers a noise-induced HIV-immune cell interaction model with immune impairment. A multiplicative white noise is introduced in the infection rate parameter to represent the fluctuations around the average value of the rate parameter as a causative effect of the noise. We analyzed the deterministic and stochastic models and prescribed sufficient conditions for infection eradication and persistence. It is determined under what parametric restrictions the asymptotic solutions of the noise-induced system will be a limiting case of the deterministic solutions. Simulation results revealed that the solutions of the deterministic system either converge to a CTL-dominated interior equilibrium or a CTL-free immunodeficient equilibrium, depending on the initial values of the system. Stochastic analysis divulged that higher noise might be helpful in the infection removal process. The extinction time of infected [math]T cells for some fixed immune impairment gradually decreases with increasing noise intensity and follows the power law.]]></summary>

Coupled Boussinesq equations are used to describe long weakly nonlinear longitudinal strain waves in a bi-layer with soft bonding between the layers (e.g., a soft adhesive). From a mathematical viewpoint, a particularly difficult case appears when the linear long-wave speeds in the layers are significantly different (high-contrast case). The traditional derivation of the uni-directional models leads to four uncoupled Ostrovsky equations for the right- and left-propagating waves in each layer. However, the models impose a “zero-mass constraint”; i.e., the initial conditions should necessarily have zero mean, restricting the applicability of that description. Here, we bypass the contradiction in this high-contrast case by constructing the solution for the deviation from the evolving mean value, using asymptotic multiple-scale expansions involving two pairs of fast characteristic variables and two slow time variables. By construction, the Ostrovsky equations emerging within the scope of this derivation are solved for initial conditions with zero mean, while initial conditions for the original system may have non-zero mean values. Asymptotic validity of the solution is carefully examined numerically. We apply the models to the description of counter-propagating waves generated by solitary wave initial conditions, or co-propagating waves generated by cnoidal wave initial conditions, as well as the resulting wave interactions, and contrast with the behavior of the waves in bi-layers when the linear long-wave speeds in the layers are close (low-contrast case). One local (classical) and two non-local (generalized) conservation laws of the coupled Boussinesq equations for strains are derived and used to control the accuracy of the numerical simulations.]]></summary>

In this work, the error splitting technique combined with cut-off function method is designed to derive unconditionally optimal error estimates for a fully implicit conservative numerical method of the N-coupled nonlinear Schrödinger–Boussinesq equations, which is constructed by an implicit Crank–Nicolson-type method in time and new nonconforming virtual element methods in space. The numerical scheme is conservative in the senses of discrete mass and energy, and the cut-off error splitting technique is innovative to remove the standard time-step conditions

We propose an approach to modeling large-scale multi-agent dynamical systems allowing interactions among more than just pairs of agents using the theory of mean field games and the notion of hypergraphons, which are obtained as limits of large hypergraphs. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work on mean field games on hypergraphs. Together with an extension to a multi-layer setup, we obtain limiting descriptions for large systems of non-linear, weakly interacting dynamical agents. On the theoretical side, we prove the well-foundedness of the resulting hypergraphon mean field game, showing both existence and approximate Nash properties. On the applied side, we extend numerical and learning algorithms to compute the hypergraphon mean field equilibria. To verify our approach empirically, we consider a social rumor spreading model, where we give agents intrinsic motivation to spread rumors to unaware agents, and an epidemic control problem.]]></summary>

Chaotic time series have been captured by reservoir computing models composed of a recurrent neural network whose output weights are trained in a supervised manner. These models, however, are typically limited to randomly connected networks of homogeneous units. Here, we propose a new class of structured reservoir models that incorporates a diversity of cell types and their known connections. In a first version of the model, the reservoir was composed of mean-rate units separated into pyramidal, parvalbumin, and somatostatin cells. Stability analysis of this model revealed two distinct dynamical regimes, namely, (i) an inhibition-stabilized network (ISN) where strong recurrent excitation is balanced by strong inhibition and (ii) a non-ISN network with weak excitation. These results were extended to a leaky integrate-and-fire model that captured different cell types along with their network architecture. ISN and non-ISN reservoir networks were trained to relay and generate a chaotic Lorenz attractor. Despite their increased performance, ISN networks operate in a regime of activity near the limits of stability where external perturbations yield a rapid divergence in output. The proposed framework of structured reservoir computing opens avenues for exploring how neural microcircuits can balance performance and stability when representing time series through distinct dynamical regimes.]]></summary>

Doxorubicin is a chemotherapy widely used to treat several types of cancer, including triple-negative breast cancer. In this work, we use a Bayesian framework to rigorously assess the ability of ten different mathematical models to describe the dynamics of four TNBC cell lines (SUM-149PT, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, and MDA-MB-468) in response to treatment with doxorubicin at concentrations ranging from 10 to 2500 nM. Each cell line was plated and serially imaged via fluorescence microscopy for 30 days following 6, 12, or 24 h of in vitro drug exposure. We use the resulting data sets to estimate the parameters of the ten pharmacodynamic models using a Bayesian approach, which accounts for uncertainties in the models, parameters, and observational data. The ten candidate models describe the growth patterns and degree of response to doxorubicin for each cell line by incorporating exponential or logistic tumor growth, and distinct forms of cell death. Cell line and treatment specific model parameters are then estimated from the experimental data for each model. We analyze all competing models using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and the selection of the best model is made according to the model probabilities (BIC weights). We show that the best model among the candidate set of models depends on the TNBC cell line and the treatment scenario, though, in most cases, there is great uncertainty in choosing the best model. However, we show that the probability of being the best model can be increased by combining treatment data with the same total drug exposure. Our analysis points to the importance of considering multiple models, built on different biological assumptions, to capture the observed variations in tumor growth and treatment response.]]></summary>

We study dynamics of a generic quadratic diffeomorphism, a 3D generalization of the planar Hénon map. Focusing on the dissipative, orientation preserving case, we give a comprehensive parameter study of codimension-one and two bifurcations. Periodic orbits, born at resonant, Neimark–Sacker bifurcations, give rise to Arnold tongues in parameter space. Aperiodic attractors include invariant circles and chaotic orbits; these are distinguished by rotation number and Lyapunov exponents. Chaotic orbits include Hénon-like and Lorenz-like attractors, which can arise from period-doubling cascades, and those born from the destruction of invariant circles. The latter lie on paraboloids near the local unstable manifold of a fixed point.]]></summary>

Change point detection (CPD) for multi-agent systems helps one to evaluate the state and better control the system. Multivariate CPD methods solve the [math] time series well; however, the multi-agent systems often produce the [math] dimensional data, where [math] is the dimension of multivariate observations, [math] is the total observation time, and [math] is the number of agents. In this paper, we propose two valid approaches based on higher-order features, namely, the Betti number feature extraction and the Persistence feature extraction, to compress the [math]-dimensional features into one dimension so that general CPD methods can be applied to higher-dimensional data. First, a topological structure based on the Vietoris–Rips complex is constructed on each time-slice snapshot. Then, the Betti number and persistence of the topological structures are obtained to separately constitute two feature matrices for change point estimates. Higher-order features primarily describe the data distribution on each snapshot and are, therefore, independent of the node correspondence cross snapshots, which gives our methods unique advantages in processing missing data. Experiments in multi-agent systems demonstrate the significant performance of our methods. We believe that our methods not only provide a new tool for dimensionality reduction and missing data in multi-agent systems but also have the potential to be applied to a wider range of fields, such as complex networks.]]></summary>

This paper investigates partial topology identification of simplicial complexes based on adaptive synchronization. For the nodes of interest, the interactions that they participate in can be accurately reconstructed by designing adaptive controllers and parameter estimators. Particularly, not only pairwise interactions but a higher-order structure can be effectively recovered by our method. Moreover, a new linear independence condition with a rigorous definition is established for parameter estimators to converge asymptotically to the true values. Numerical simulations on a general two-dimensional simplicial complex as well as a real-world structure are provided to show the validity of the result and discuss the influence of different parameters on the identification process.]]></summary>

Within the framework of p-adaptive flux reconstruction, we aim to construct efficient polynomial multigrid (pMG) preconditioners for implicit time integration of the Navier–Stokes equations using Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov (JFNK) methods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
A time-continuous (tc-)embedding method is first proposed for solving nonlinear scalar hyperbolic conservation laws with discontinuous solutions (shocks and rarefaction waves) on codimension 1, connected, smooth, and closed manifolds (surface PDEs or SPDEs in 
                      
                      \({\mathbb {R}}^2\)
                      
                     and 
                      
                      \({\mathbb {R}}^3\)
                      
                    ). The new embedding method improves upon the classical closest point (cp-)embedding method, which requires re-establishments of the constant-along-normal (CAN-)property of the extension function at every time step, in terms of accuracy and efficiency, by incorporating the CAN-property analytically and explicitly in the embedding equation. The tc-embedding SPDEs are solved by the second-order nonlinear central finite volume scheme with a nonlinear minmod slope limiter in space, and the third-order total variation diminished Runge-Kutta scheme in time. An adaptive nonlinear essentially non-oscillatory polynomial interpolation is used to obtain the solution values at the ghost cells. Numerical results in solving the linear wave equation and the Burgers’ equation show that the proposed tc-embedding method has better accuracy, improved resolution, and reduced CPU times than the classical cp-embedding method. The Burgers’ equation, the traffic flow problem, and the Buckley-Leverett equation are solved to demonstrate the robust performance of the tc-embedding method in resolving fine-scale structures efficiently even in the presence of a shock and the essentially non-oscillatory capturing of shocks and rarefaction waves on simple and complex shaped one-dimensional manifolds. Burgers’ equation is also solved on the two-dimensional torus-shaped and spherical-shaped manifolds.]]></summary>

In this work we study the solution of the Riemann problem for the barotropic version of the conservative symmetric hyperbolic and thermodynamically compatible (SHTC) two-phase flow model introduced in Romenski et al. (J Sci Comput 42(1):68, 2009, Quart Appl Math 65(2):259–279, 2007). All characteristic fields are carefully studied and explicit expressions are derived for the Riemann invariants and the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions. Due to the presence of multiple characteristics in the system under consideration, non-standard wave phenomena can occur. Therefore we briefly review admissibility conditions for discontinuities and then discuss possible wave interactions. In particular we will show that overlapping rarefaction waves are possible and moreover we may have shocks that lie inside a rarefaction wave. In contrast to nonconservative two phase flow models, such as the Baer–Nunziato system, we can use the advantage of the conservative form of the model under consideration. Furthermore, we show the relation between the considered conservative SHTC system and the corresponding barotropic version of the nonconservative Baer–Nunziato model. Additionally, we derive the reduced four equation Kapila system for the case of instantaneous relaxation, which is the common limit system of both, the conservative SHTC model and the non-conservative Baer–Nunziato model. Finally, we compare exact solutions of the Riemann problem with numerical results obtained for the conservative two-phase flow model under consideration, for the non-conservative Baer–Nunziato system and for the Kapila limit. The examples underline the previous analysis of the different wave phenomena, as well as differences and similarities of the three systems.]]></summary>

Summation-By-Parts (SBP) methods provide a systematic way of constructing provably stable numerical schemes. However, many proofs of convergence and accuracy rely on the assumption that the SBP operator possesses a particular eigenvalue property. In this note, three results pertaining to this property are proven. Firstly, the eigenvalue property does not hold for all nullspace consistent SBP operators. Secondly, this issue can be addressed without affecting the accuracy of the method by adding a specially designed, arbitrarily small perturbation term to the SBP operator. Thirdly, all pseudospectral methods satisfy the eigenvalue property.]]></summary>

Implementing deep neural networks for learning the solution maps of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) turns out to be more efficient than using many conventional numerical methods. However, limited theoretical analyses have been conducted on this approach. In this study, we investigate the expressive power of deep rectified quadratic unit (ReQU) neural networks for approximating the solution maps of parametric PDEs. The proposed approach is motivated by the recent important work of Kutyniok et al. (Constr Approx 1–53, 2021), which uses deep rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks for solving parametric PDEs. In contrast to the previously established complexity-bound

Ott and Antonsen [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008)] have found an invariant finite-dimensional subspace on which the dynamics is described by one complex variable per population. For oscillators with Cauchy distributed frequencies or for those driven by Cauchy white noise, this subspace is weakly stable and, thus, describes the asymptotic dynamics. Here, we report on an exact finite-dimensional reduction of the dynamics outside of the Ott–Antonsen subspace. We show that the evolution from generic initial states can be reduced to that of three complex variables, plus a constant function. For identical noise-free oscillators, this reduction corresponds to the Watanabe–Strogatz system of equations [Watanabe and Strogatz, Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 2391 (1993)]. We discuss how the reduced system can be used to explore the transient dynamics of perturbed ensembles.]]></summary>

Different from the linear counterpart, elastic wave propagation in nonlinear elastic metamaterials with damping (EMD) systems has much more novel behaviors. It is little work that reveals the nonlinear wave propagation mechanism in the nonlinear EMD in the literature. In this paper, nonlinear EMD systems with different configurations for the nonlinear elements are constructed to study the nonlinear wave propagation characteristics based on the analytical formulation. Nonlinear wave propagation attenuation characteristics in nonlinear EMD systems are studied in the frequency-domain. Spectro-spatial characteristics of nonlinear traveling wave packet in space- and time-domain are also analyzed to reveal space frequency-domain characteristics. Influences of different configurations for the nonlinear elements on wave propagation in nonlinear EMD systems are discussed. Results shown that locations of band structures can be tuned by changing intensities of nonlinearities in the nonlinear EMD systems, which are not found in the linear system. Moreover, different configurations for the nonlinear elements can lead to localization feature emerged in a nonlinear EMD system, which indicates solitary waves causing from the interaction between dispersion and nonlinearity exist in the nonlinear systems. This interesting wave propagating properties can be used to design new devices for acoustic switches, energy harvesting, and broadband vibration control.]]></summary>

Systems of nonlinear chemical oscillators can exhibit a large diversity of non-trivial states depending on the parameters that characterize them. Among these, a synchronization phenomenon is of special interest due to its direct link with chemical and biological processes in nature. We carry out numerical experiments for two different sets of chemical oscillators with different properties and immersed in a Belousov–Zhabotinsky solution. We document the emergence of different states of synchronization that depend on the parameters characterizing the solution. We also show that, in the interface regions, this system generates a stable dynamics of intermittency between the different synchronization states where interesting phenomena, such as the “devil's staircase,” emerge. In general, the added complexity introduced with the additional set of oscillators results in more complex non-trivial synchronization states.]]></summary>

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder with recurrent seizures, which convey complex dynamical characteristics including chaos and randomness. Until now, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated, especially the bistable property beneath the epileptic random induction phenomena in certain conditions. Inspired by the recent finding that astrocyte GTPase-activating protein (G-protein)-coupled receptors could be involved in stochastic epileptic seizures, we proposed a neuron–astrocyte network model, incorporating the noise of the astrocytic second messenger, inositol triphosphate (IP3) that is modulated by G-protein-coupled receptor activation. Based on this model, we have statistically analyzed the transitions of epileptic seizures by performing repeatable simulation trials. Our simulation results show that the increase in the IP3 noise intensity induces depolarization-block epileptic seizures together with an increase in neuronal firing frequency, consistent with corresponding experiments. Meanwhile, the bistable states of the seizure dynamics were present under certain noise intensities, during which the neuronal firing pattern switches between regular sparse spiking and epileptic seizure states. This random presence of epileptic seizures is absent when the noise intensity continues to increase, accompanying with an increase in the epileptic depolarization block duration. The simulation results also shed light on the fact that calcium signals in astrocytes play significant roles in the pattern formations of the epileptic seizure. Our results provide a potential pathway for understanding the epileptic randomness in certain conditions.]]></summary>

As seen by an observer in the rotating frame, the earth’s small spheroidal deformations neutralize the centrifugal force, leaving only the smaller Coriolis force to govern the “inertial” motion of objects that move on its surface, assumed smooth and frictionless. Previous studies of inertial motion employ weakly spheroidal equations of motion that ignore the influence of the centrifugal force and yet treat the earth as a sphere. The latitude dependence of these equations renders them strongly nonlinear. We derive and justify these equations and use them to identify, classify, name, describe, and illustrate all possible classes of inertial motion, including a new class of motion called circumpolar waves, which encircle both poles during each cycle of the motion. We illustrate these classes using CorioVis, our freely available Coriolis visualization software. We identify a rotational/time-reversal symmetry for motion on the earth’s surface and use this symmetry to develop and validate closed-form small-amplitude approximations for the four main classes and one degenerate class of inertial motion. For these five classes, we supply calculations of experimentally relevant frequencies, zonal drifts, and latitude ranges.]]></summary>

Further important factors that are taken into account are the choice of time integrator and the initial data for the micro problem which has to be set appropriately to get a consistent scheme.

The saddle point (SP) calculation is a grand challenge for computationally intensive energy function in computational chemistry area, where the saddle point may represent the transition state. The traditional methods need to evaluate the gradients of the energy function at a very large number of locations. To reduce the number of expensive computations of the true gradients, we propose an active learning framework consisting of a statistical surrogate model, Gaussian process regression (GPR) for the energy function, and a single-walker dynamics method, gentle accent dynamics (GAD), for the saddle-type transition states. SP is detected by the GAD applied to the GPR surrogate for the gradient vector and the Hessian matrix. Our key ingredient for efficiency improvements is an active learning method which sequentially designs the most informative locations and takes evaluations of the original model at these locations to train GPR. We formulate this active learning task as the optimal experimental design problem and propose a very efficient sample-based sub-optimal criterion to construct the optimal locations. We show that the new method significantly decreases the required number of energy or force evaluations of the original model.]]></summary>

In this paper, we introduce, theoretically analyze and numerically investigate a class of three-field finite element formulations of the generalized Biot-Brinkman equations. By introducing appropriate norms, we demonstrate that the proposed finite element discretization, as well as an associated preconditioning strategy, is robust with respect to the relevant parameter regimes.

Models of coupled oscillator networks play an important role in describing collective synchronization dynamics in biological and technological systems. The Kuramoto model describes oscillator’s phase evolution and explains the transition from incoherent to coherent oscillations under simplifying assumptions, including all-to-all coupling with uniform strength. Real world networks, however, often display heterogeneous connectivity and coupling weights that influence the critical threshold for this transition. We formulate a general mean-field theory (Vlasov–Focker Planck equation) for stochastic Kuramoto-type phase oscillator models, valid for coupling graphs/networks with heterogeneous connectivity and coupling strengths, using graphop theory in the mean-field limit. Considering symmetric odd-valued coupling functions, we mathematically prove an exact formula for the critical threshold for the incoherence–coherence transition. We numerically test the predicted threshold using large finite-size representations of the network model. For a large class of graph models, we find that the numerical tests agree very well with the predicted threshold obtained from mean-field theory. However, the prediction is more difficult in practice for graph structures that are sufficiently sparse. Our findings open future research avenues toward a deeper understanding of mean-field theories for heterogeneous systems.]]></summary>

The ultimate purpose of the statistical analysis of ordinal patterns is to characterize the distribution of the features they induce. In particular, knowing the joint distribution of the pair entropy-statistical complexity for a large class of time series models would allow statistical tests that are unavailable to date. Working in this direction, we characterize the asymptotic distribution of the empirical Shannon’s entropy for any model under which the true normalized entropy is neither zero nor one. We obtain the asymptotic distribution from the central limit theorem (assuming large time series), the multivariate delta method, and a third-order correction of its mean value. We discuss the applicability of other results (exact, first-, and second-order corrections) regarding their accuracy and numerical stability. Within a general framework for building test statistics about Shannon’s entropy, we present a bilateral test that verifies if there is enough evidence to reject the hypothesis that two signals produce ordinal patterns with the same Shannon’s entropy. We applied this bilateral test to the daily maximum temperature time series from three cities (Dublin, Edinburgh, and Miami) and obtained sensible results.]]></summary>

A vast body of experiments share the view that social norms are major factors for the emergence of fairness in a population of individuals playing the dictator game (DG). Recently, to explore which social norms are conducive to sustaining cooperation has obtained considerable concern. However, thus, far few studies have investigated how social norms influence the evolution of fairness by means of indirect reciprocity. In this study, we propose an indirect reciprocal model of the DG and consider that an individual can be assigned as the dictator due to its good reputation. We investigate the “leading eight” norms and all second-order social norms by a two-timescale theoretical analysis. We show that when role assignment is based on reputation, four of the “leading eight” norms, including stern judging and simple standing, lead to a high level of fairness, which increases with the selection intensity. Our work also reveals that not only the correct treatment of making a fair split with good recipients but also distinguishing unjustified unfair split from justified unfair split matters in elevating the level of fairness.]]></summary>

We consider several topologies of power grids and analyze how the addition of transmission lines affects their dynamics. The main example we are dealing with is a power grid that has a tree-like three-element motif at the periphery. We establish conditions where the addition of a transmission line in the motif enhances its stability or induces Braess’s paradox and reduces stability of the entire grid. By using bifurcation theory and nonlocal stability analysis, we show that two scenarios for Braess’s paradox are realized in the grid. The first scenario is well described and is associated with the disappearance of the synchronous mode. The second scenario has not been previously described and is associated with the reduction of nonlocal stability of the synchronous mode due to the appearance of asynchronous modes. The necessary conditions for stable operation of the grid, under the addition of a line, are derived. It is proved that the new scenario for Braess’s paradox is realized in the grids with more complex topologies even when several lines are added in their bulks.]]></summary>

The way of information diffusion among individuals can be quite complicated, and it is not only limited to one type of communication, but also impacted by multiple channels. Meanwhile, it is easier for an agent to accept an idea once the proportion of their friends who take it goes beyond a specific threshold. Furthermore, in social networks, some higher-order structures, such as simplicial complexes and hypergraph, can describe more abundant and realistic phenomena. Therefore, based on the classical multiplex network model coupling the infectious disease with its relevant information, we propose a novel epidemic model, in which the lower layer represents the physical contact network depicting the epidemic dissemination, while the upper layer stands for the online social network picturing the diffusion of information. In particular, the upper layer is generated by random simplicial complexes, among which the herd-like threshold model is adopted to characterize the information diffusion, and the unaware–aware–unaware model is also considered simultaneously. Using the microscopic Markov chain approach, we analyze the epidemic threshold of the proposed epidemic model and further check the results with numerous Monte Carlo simulations. It is discovered that the threshold model based on the random simplicial complexes network may still cause abrupt transitions on the epidemic threshold. It is also found that simplicial complexes may greatly influence the epidemic size at a steady state.]]></summary>

We study the spreading of renewable power fluctuations through grids with Ohmic losses on the lines. By formulating a network-adapted linear response theory, we find that vulnerability patterns are linked to the left Laplacian eigenvectors of the overdamped eigenmodes. We show that for tree-like networks, fluctuations are amplified in the opposite direction of the power flow. This novel mechanism explains vulnerability patterns that were observed in previous numerical simulations of renewable microgrids. While exact mathematical derivations are only possible for tree-like networks with a homogeneous response, we show that the mechanisms discovered also explain vulnerability patterns in realistic heterogeneous meshed grids by studying the IEEE RTS-1996 test system.]]></summary>

In this paper, analytical predictions of the firing cascades formed by stable and unstable firings in a Hindmarsh–Rose (HR) neuron system are completed via an implicit mapping method. The semi-analytical firing cascades present the route from periodic firings to chaos. For such cascades, the continuous firing flow of the nonlinear neuron system is discretized to form a special mapping structure for nonlinear firing activities. Stability and bifurcation analysis of the nonlinear firings are performed based on resultant eigenvalues of the global mapping structures. Stable and unstable firing solutions in the bifurcation tree exhibit clear period-doubling firing cascades toward chaos. Bifurcations are predicted accurately on the connections. Phase bifurcation trees are observed, which provide deep cognitions of neuronal firings. Harmonic dynamics of the period-doubling firing cascades are obtained and discussed for a better understanding of the contribution of the harmonics in frequency domains. The route into chaos is illustrated by the firing chains from period-1 to period-16 firings and verified by numerical solutions. The applied methods and obtained results provide new perspectives to the complex firing dynamics of the HR neuron system and present a potential strategy to regulate the firings of neurons.]]></summary>

To facilitate the analysis of pattern formation and the related phase transitions in Bose–Einstein condensates, we present an explicit approximate mapping from the nonlocal Gross–Pitaevskii equation with cubic nonlinearity to a phase field crystal (PFC) model. This approximation is valid close to the superfluid–supersolid phase transition boundary. The simplified PFC model permits the exploration of bifurcations and phase transitions via numerical path continuation employing standard software. While revealing the detailed structure of the bifurcations present in the system, we demonstrate the existence of localized states in the PFC approximation. Finally, we discuss how higher-order nonlinearities change the structure of the bifurcation diagram representing the transitions found in the system.]]></summary>

In this paper, we study the network pinning control problem in the presence of two different types of coupling: (i) node-to-node coupling among the network nodes and (ii) input-to-node coupling from the source node to the “pinned nodes.” Previous work has mainly focused on the case that (i) and (ii) are of the same type. We decouple the stability analysis of the target synchronous solution into subproblems of the lowest dimension by using the techniques of simultaneous block diagonalization of matrices. Interestingly, we obtain two different types of blocks, driven and undriven. The overall dimension of the driven blocks is equal to the dimension of an appropriately defined controllable subspace, while all the remaining undriven blocks are scalar. Our main result is a decomposition of the stability problem into four independent sets of equations, which we call quotient controllable, quotient uncontrollable, redundant controllable, and redundant uncontrollable. Our analysis shows that the number and location of the pinned nodes affect the number and the dimension of each set of equations. We also observe that in a large variety of complex networks, the stability of the target synchronous solution is de facto only determined by a single quotient controllable block.]]></summary>

Confronted with the biological problem of managing plasticity in cell populations, which is in particular responsible for transient and reversible drug resistance in cancer, we propose a rationale consisting of an integro-differential and a reaction-advection-diffusion equation, the properties of which are studied theoretically and numerically. By using a constructive finite volume method, we show the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution and illustrate by numerical approximations and their simulations the capacity of the model to exhibit divergence of traits. This feature may be theoretically interpreted as describing a physiological step towards multicellularity in animal evolution and, closer to present-day clinical challenges in oncology, as a possible representation of bet hedging in cancer cell populations.]]></summary>

We revisit the problem of diffusion in a driven system consisting of an inertial Brownian particle moving in a symmetric periodic potential and subjected to a symmetric time-periodic force. We reveal parameter domains in which diffusion is normal in the long time limit and exhibits intriguing giant damped quasiperiodic oscillations as a function of the external driving amplitude. As the mechanism behind this effect, we identify the corresponding oscillations of difference in the number of locked and running trajectories that carry the leading contribution to the diffusion coefficient. Our findings can be verified experimentally in a multitude of physical systems, including colloidal particles, Josephson junction, or cold atoms dwelling in optical lattices, to name only a few.]]></summary>

We evaluate Schelling’s segregation outcomes from the square lattice, regular random networks, and clustered regular random networks by situating them in the probability distribution of the entire outcome space of satisfaction and segregation. To do so, we employ the Wang–Landau algorithm and calculate the entropy and the number of states as a function of satisfaction and segregation. According to the results, satisfaction tends to increase with segregation, irrespective of the network structure. Moreover, segregation occurs almost surely when satisfaction is maximized, which we also algebraically derive and confirm on infinite-size networks. The average ratios of the neighbors of the same tag are about 67% for the square lattice and regular random networks and about 73% for clustered regular random networks with a clustering coefficient of 0.37(1). Thus, clustering increases segregation on regular random networks. Further, we find that Schelling’s path-dependent process generates sharper segregation than expected by random configurations, an outcome symptomatic of over-optimization from the social welfare perspective. Adopting an alternative rule restricting individuals’ choice set may reduce segregation without compromising on satisfaction.]]></summary>

Convective dissolution can occur in porous media when a given solute dissolves in a host layer from above and increases the density of the host solution. Buoyancy-driven fingering can then develop, which increases the transfer flux of the solute. We investigate here numerically the properties of this convective dissolution when the porous host layer is inclined by an angle [math] relative to the horizontal direction. We consider an incompressible flow in porous media governed by Darcy’s law, driven by density gradients associated with the concentration of the dissolving solute. The model problem focuses on the case of a very long (infinite) tilted porous layer limited by two parallel impermeable surfaces. A linear stability analysis and nonlinear simulations are performed using the Boussinesq approximation. A vorticity-stream function formulation is adopted to solve the two-dimensional hydrodynamic field through the finite element method. We find that the inclination of the interface decreases the growth rate of the instability and the range of unstable wavenumbers, delaying or even suppressing the onset of the fingering instability. Moreover, it introduces a drift velocity on the perturbations, which is characterized here in both the linear stability analysis and the nonlinear simulations.]]></summary>

Our increasing dependence on infrastructure networks leads to growing concerns over the protection of these networks. Many methods have been proposed to select protective strategies by combining complex network theory and game theory. However, the misleading effect of hidden links is not considered in previous methods. This work creates an information gap between attackers and defenders by partly hiding network links to mislead the attacker in the game. We first introduce the rule of link hiding that depends on the nodes’ property, where the number of hidden links has a maximum value. Additionally, based on the Stackelberg game model, we establish an attack–defense game model with link hiding strategies considering node property and cost constraints. Finally, we conduct experiments in a scale-free network and an existing power grid. The experimental results show that the defender tends to combine first-mover advantage and link hiding to get a better payoff under more different costs of the nodes. Hiding half of the links in the existing power grid can effectively reduce network damage by about [math]% on average, with the two sides investing the same resources. The effect of link hiding could be more obvious when the attacker owns more resources than the defender. When an attacker employs the high-degree attacking strategy, the proposed link hiding method can help the defender reduce the damage to the network by 12.2% compared to the link reconnecting method.]]></summary>

One approach to understand the chaotic dynamics of nonlinear dissipative systems is the study of non-chaotic yet dynamically unstable invariant solutions embedded in the system’s chaotic attractor. The significance of zero-dimensional unstable fixed points and one-dimensional unstable periodic orbits capturing time-periodic dynamics is widely accepted for high-dimensional chaotic systems, including fluid turbulence, while higher-dimensional invariant tori representing quasiperiodic dynamics have rarely been considered. We demonstrate that unstable 2-tori are generically embedded in the hyperchaotic attractor of a dissipative system of ordinary differential equations; tori can be numerically identified via bifurcations of unstable periodic orbits and their parameteric continuation and characterization of stability properties are feasible. As higher-dimensional tori are expected to be structurally unstable, 2-tori together with periodic orbits and equilibria form a complete set of relevant invariant solutions on which to base a dynamical description of chaos.]]></summary>

Reservoir computing is a machine learning approach that can generate a surrogate model of a dynamical system. It can learn the underlying dynamical system using fewer trainable parameters and, hence, smaller training data sets than competing approaches. Recently, a simpler formulation, known as next-generation reservoir computing, removed many algorithm metaparameters and identified a well-performing traditional reservoir computer, thus simplifying training even further. Here, we study a particularly challenging problem of learning a dynamical system that has both disparate time scales and multiple co-existing dynamical states (attractors). We compare the next-generation and traditional reservoir computer using metrics quantifying the geometry of the ground-truth and forecasted attractors. For the studied four-dimensional system, the next-generation reservoir computing approach uses [math] less training data, requires [math] shorter “warmup” time, has fewer metaparameters, and has an [math] higher accuracy in predicting the co-existing attractor characteristics in comparison to a traditional reservoir computer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it predicts the basin of attraction with high accuracy. This work lends further support to the superior learning ability of this new machine learning algorithm for dynamical systems.]]></summary>

This is a review of group entropy and its application to permutation complexity. Specifically, we revisit a new approach to the notion of complexity in the time series analysis based on both permutation entropy and group entropy. As a result, the permutation entropy rate can be extended from deterministic dynamics to random processes. More generally, our approach provides a unified framework to discuss chaotic and random behaviors.]]></summary>

The low-frequency variability of the extratropical atmosphere involves hemispheric-scale recurring, often persistent, states known as teleconnection patterns or regimes, which can have a profound impact on predictability on intra-seasonal and longer timescales. However, reliable data-driven identification and dynamical representation of such states are still challenging problems in modeling the dynamics of the atmosphere. We present a new method, which allows us both to detect recurring regimes of atmospheric variability and to obtain dynamical variables serving as an embedding for these regimes. The method combines two approaches from nonlinear data analysis: partitioning a network of recurrent states with studying its properties by the recurrence quantification analysis and the kernel principal component analysis. We apply the method to study teleconnection patterns in a quasi-geostrophical model of atmospheric circulation over the extratropical hemisphere as well as to reanalysis data of geopotential height anomalies in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere atmosphere in the winter seasons from 1981 to the present. It is shown that the detected regimes as well as the obtained set of dynamical variables explain large-scale weather patterns, which are associated, in particular, with severe winters over Eurasia and North America. The method presented opens prospects for improving empirical modeling and long-term forecasting of large-scale atmospheric circulation regimes.]]></summary>

We study the fractional maps of complex order, [math], for [math] and [math] in one and two dimensions. In two dimensions, we study Hénon, Duffing, and Lozi maps, and in [math], we study logistic, tent, Gauss, circle, and Bernoulli maps. The generalization in [math] can be done in two different ways, which are not equivalent for fractional order and lead to different bifurcation diagrams. We observed that the smooth maps, such as logistic, Gauss, Duffing, and Hénon maps, do not show chaos, while discontinuous maps, such as Bernoulli and circle maps,show chaos. The tent and Lozi map are continuous but not differentiable, and they show chaos as well. In [math], we find that the complex fractional-order maps that show chaos also show multistability. Thus, it can be inferred that the smooth maps of complex fractional order tend to show more regular behavior than the discontinuous or non-differentiable maps.]]></summary>

This paper reports the first finding of cupolets in a chaotic Hindmarsh–Rose neural model. Cupolets (chaotic, unstable, periodic, orbit-lets) are unstable periodic orbits that have been stabilized through a particular control scheme by applying a binary control sequence. We demonstrate different neural dynamics (periodic or chaotic) of the Hindmarsh–Rose model through a bifurcation diagram where the external input current, [math], is the bifurcation parameter. We select a region in the chaotic parameter space and provide the results of numerical simulations. In this chosen parameter space, a control scheme is applied when the trajectory intersects with either of the two control planes. The type of the control is determined by a bit in a binary control sequence. The control is either a small microcontrol (0) or a large macrocontrol (1) that adjusts the future dynamics of the trajectory by a perturbation determined by the coding function [math]. We report the discovery of many cupolets with corresponding control sequences and comment on the differences with previously reported cupolets in the double scroll system. We provide some examples of the generated cupolets and conclude by discussing potential implications for biological neurons.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Data-driven stochastic parameterization methods use observational data to support and improve existing prediction systems. Specifically in atmospheric sciences, uncertainty in observations is a challenge for modeling because several aspects of the physical processes are yet to be understood in some contexts. A key goal in constructing atmospheric models is to express unresolved processes using the resolved variables of a prediction system. Estimating parameterisations for highly nonlinear systems with non stationary data requires application-specific tools. Previous work on methods for analyzing nonstationary data presents a flexible model-based nonparametric clustering methodology that can be exploited for parameterization development. This paper adapts the existing framework for stochastic parameterization by combining the continuous-time formulation of stochastic differential equations (SDE) with the clustering method. We use a closed-form likelihood function approach based on a suitable Hermite expansion to approximate the parameter values of the SDE with arbitrary nonlinear drift and nonlinear diffusion. The novel parameterization framework provides a smooth classification function that allows us to recover the underlying temporal parameter modulation of a nonstationary one-dimensional SDE. The numerical examples show that the clustering approach recovers a hidden functional relationship between the parameters of the SDE model and an additional auxiliary process. The study builds upon this functional relationship to develop closed-form, nonstationary, data-driven stochastic models for multiscale dynamical systems in real-world applications.]]></summary>

This paper applies new and recently introduced approaches to study trends in gun violence in the United States. We use techniques in both the time and frequency domain to provide a more complete understanding of gun violence dynamics. We analyze gun violence incidents on a state-by-state basis as recorded by the Gun Violence Archive. We have numerous specific phenomena of focus, including periodicity of incidents, locations in time where behavioral changes occur, and shifts in gun violence patterns since April 2020. First, we implement a recently introduced method of spectral density estimation for nonstationary time series to investigate periodicity on a state-by-state basis, including revealing where periodic behaviors change with time. We can also classify different patterns of behavioral changes among the states. We then aim to understand the most significant shifts in gun violence since numerous key events in 2020, including the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns, and periods of civil unrest. Our dual-domain analysis provides a more thorough understanding and challenges numerous widely held conceptions regarding the prevalence of gun violence incidents.]]></summary>

We provide a convergence analysis of the localized orthogonal decomposition (LOD) method for Schrödinger equations with general multiscale potentials in the semiclassical regime. We focus on the influence of the semiclassical parameter and the multiscale structure of the potential on the numerical scheme. We construct localized multiscale basis functions by solving a constrained energy minimization problem in the framework of the LOD method. We show that localized multiscale basis functions with a smaller support can be constructed as the semiclassical parameter approaches zero. We obtain the first-order convergence in the energy norm and second-order convergence in the

                     norm for the LOD method and super convergence rates can be obtained if the solution possesses sufficiently high regularity. We analyse the temporal and spatial regularity of the solution and find that the spatial derivatives are more oscillatory than the time derivatives in the presence of a multiscale potential. By combining the regularity analysis, we are able to derive the dependence of the error estimates on the small parameters of the Schrödinger equation. Moreover, we find that the LOD method outperforms the finite element method in the presence of a multiscale potential due to the super convergence for high-regularity solutions and more relaxed dependence of the error estimates on the small parameters for low-regularity solutions. Finally, we present numerical results to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

For numerically solving the high frequency Helmholtz equation, the conventional finite difference and finite element methods based on discretizing the equation on meshes usually suffer from the numerical dispersion errors (‘pollution effect’) that require very refined meshes (Babuska and Sauter in SIAM Rev 42(3):451–484, 2000). Asymptotic methods like geometrical optics provide an alternative way to compute the solutions without ‘pollution effect’, but they generally can only compute locally valid approximations for the solutions and fail to capture the caustics faithfully. In order to obtain globally valid solutions efficiently without ‘pollution effect’, we transfer the problem into a fixed-point problem related to an exponential operator, and the associated functional evaluations are achieved by unconditionally stable operator-splitting based pseudospectral schemes such that large step sizes are allowed to reach the approximated fixed point efficiently for certain prescribed accuracy requirement. And the Anderson acceleration is incorporated to accelerate the convergence. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the method.]]></summary>

Our approach to establishing generic convergence to periodic solutions applies to high-dimensional epidemic systems and predator-prey systems, very much like the generic convergence to equilibria in cooperative systems using the classical monotone dynamical systems theory.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Optimal transport, a theory for optimal allocation of resources, is widely used in various fields such as astrophysics, machine learning, and imaging science. However, many applications impose elementwise constraints on the transport plan which traditional optimal transport cannot enforce. Here we introduce supervised optimal transport (sOT), which formulates a constrained optimal transport problem where couplings between certain elements are prohibited according to specific applications. sOT is proved to be equivalent to an [math] penalized optimization problem, from which efficient algorithms are designed to solve its entropy regularized formulation. We demonstrate the capability of sOT by comparing it to other variants and extensions of traditional optimal transport in the color transfer problem. We also study the barycenter problem in sOT formulation, where we discover and prove a unique reverse and portion selection (control) mechanism. Supervised optimal transport is broadly applicable to applications in which a constrained transport plan is involved and the original unit should be preserved by avoiding normalization.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In the online packet scheduling problem with deadlines ([math], for short), the goal is to schedule transmissions of packets that arrive over time in a network switch and need to be sent across a link. Each packet has a deadline, representing its urgency, and a nonnegative weight, which represents its priority. Only one packet can be transmitted in any time slot, so if the system is overloaded, some packets will inevitably miss their deadlines and be dropped. In this scenario, the natural objective is to compute a transmission schedule that maximizes the total weight of packets that are successfully transmitted. The problem is inherently online, with the scheduling decisions made without the knowledge of future packet arrivals. The central problem concerning [math] that has been a subject of intensive study since 2001 is to determine the optimal competitive ratio of online algorithms, namely the worst-case ratio between the optimum total weight of a schedule (computed by an offline algorithm) and the weight of a schedule computed by a (deterministic) online algorithm. We solve this open problem by presenting a [math]-competitive online algorithm for [math] (where [math] is the golden ratio), matching the previously established lower bound.]]></summary>

Almost all epidemic models make the assumption that infection is driven by the interaction between pairs of individuals, one of whom is infectious and the other of whom is susceptible. However, in society individuals mix in groups of varying sizes, at varying times, allowing one or more infectives to be in close contact with one or more susceptible individuals at a given point in time. In this paper we study the effect of mixing groups beyond pairs on the transmission of an infectious disease in an SIR (susceptible

We also derive central limit theorems for the final size of (i) an epidemic with many initial infectives and (ii) a major outbreak triggered by few initial infectives. We show that, for a given basic reproduction number

Moreover, the standard pair-based homogeneously mixing epidemic model is shown to represent the worst case scenario, with both the highest probability and the largest final size of a major epidemic.]]></summary>

In this paper, a fifth-order finite difference mapped weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme with unequal-size stencils, termed as MUS-WENO, is designed for hyperbolic conservation laws. The new mapping function and nonlinear weights are proposed to reduce the difference between the linear weights and nonlinear weights. It could get smaller numerical errors and obtain fifth-order accuracy, give optimal fifth-order convergence with a tiny

                     even near critical points in smooth regions, and simultaneously suppress spurious oscillations near strong discontinuities. Comparing with the classical fifth-order finite difference WENO schemes and fifth-order finite difference mapped WENO (MWENO) schemes, this mapped WENO scheme uses three unequal-size stencils and the linear weights which can be any positive numbers on condition that their summation is one. Another advantage is that we can reconstruct polynomial over the whole big stencil, while many classical high-order WENO reconstructions only reconstruct the values at the boundary points or discrete quadrature points. Extensive examples including some steady-state problems and some low density, low pressure, or low energy extreme problems are used to testify the good representations of this new MUS-WENO scheme.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We show the possibility of achieving nonreciprocal wave propagation in space-time modulated media and give an asymptotic analysis of the nonreciprocity property in terms of the amplitude of the time modulation. Such modulation causes a folding of the band structure of the material, which may induce degenerate points. By breaking time-reversal symmetry, we show that these degeneracies may open into nonsymmetric, unidirectional band gaps. Finally, we illustrate our results by several numerical simulations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Under the strong exponential-time hypothesis, the diameter of general unweighted graphs cannot be computed in truly subquadratic time (in the size [math] of the input), as shown by Roditty and Williams. Nevertheless there are several graph classes for which this can be done such as bounded-treewidth graphs, interval graphs, and planar graphs, to name a few. We propose to study unweighted graphs of constant distance Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC)-dimension as a broad generalization of many such classes—where the distance VC-dimension of a graph [math] is defined as the VC-dimension of its ball hypergraph whose hyperedges are the balls of all possible radii and centers in [math]. In particular for any fixed [m…]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper proposes a new general technique for maximal subgraph enumeration which we call proximity search, whose aim is to design efficient enumeration algorithms for problems that could not be solved by existing frameworks. To support this claim and illustrate the technique we include output-polynomial algorithms for several problems for which output-polynomial algorithms were not known, including the enumeration of maximal bipartite subgraphs, maximal [math]-degenerate subgraphs (for bounded [math]), maximal induced chordal subgraphs, and maximal induced trees. Using known techniques, such as reverse search, the space of all maximal solutions induces an implicit directed graph called “solution graph” or “supergraph,” and solutions are enumerated by traversing it; however, nodes in this graph can have exponential out-degree, thus requiring exponential time to be spent on each solution. The novelty of proximity search is a formalization that allows us to define a better solution graph, and a technique, which we call canonical reconstruction, by which we can exploit the properties of given problems to build such graphs. This results in solution graphs whose nodes have significantly smaller (i.e., polynomial) out-degree with respect to existing approaches, but that remain strongly connected, so that all solutions can be enumerated in polynomial delay by a traversal. A drawback of this approach is the space required to keep track of visited solutions, which can be exponential; we further propose a technique to induce a parent-child relationship among solutions and achieve polynomial space when suitable conditions are met.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the following problem: Given a continuous domain [math] along with its convex hull [math], a point [math], and a measure [math] on [math], find the probability density over [math] whose marginal is [math] and that minimizes the KL divergence to the uniform density with respect to [math]. Several distributions in mathematics, physics, statistics, and theoretical computer science arise by different settings of the parameters of this problem. We give a polynomial bound on the norm of the optimizer of the dual problem that holds in a very general setting and relies on a “balance” property of the measure [math] on [math], and exact algorithms for evaluating the dual and its gradient for several interesting settings of [math] and [math]. Together, along with the ellipsoid method, these results imply polynomial-time algorithms to compute such KL divergence minimizing distributions in several cases. Applications of our results include (1) an optimization characterization of the Goemans–Williamson measure [M. X. Goemans and D. P. Williamson, J ACM, 42 (1995), pp. 1115–1145] that is used to round a positive semidefinite matrix to a vector; (2) the computability of the entropic barrier for convex bodies, given a strong integration oracle, studied by [S. Bubeck and R. Eldan, Proc. Mach. Learn. Res. (PMLR), 40 (2015), p. 279], and (3) a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the barycentric quantum entropy of a density matrix that was proposed as an alternative to von Neumann entropy [W. Band and J. L. Park, Found. Phys., 6 (1976), pp. 249–262; J. L. Park and W. Band, Found. Phys., 7 (1977), pp. 233–244; P. B. Slater, Phys. Lett. A, 159 (1991), pp. 411–414]; this corresponds to the case when [math] is the set of rank-one projection matrices and [math] is derived from the Haar measure on the unit sphere.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper considers Bayesian revenue maximization in the [math]-unit setting, where a monopolist seller has [math] copies of an indivisible item and faces [math] unit-demand buyers (whose value distributions can be nonidentical). Four basic mechanisms among others have been widely employed in practice and widely studied in the literature: Myerson auction, sequential posted-pricing, [math]-th price auction with anonymous reserve, and anonymous pricing. Regarding a pair of mechanisms, we investigate the largest possible ratio between the two revenues (also known as the revenue gap), over all possible value distributions of the buyers. Divide these four mechanisms into two groups: (i) the discriminating mechanism group, Myerson auction and sequential posted-pricing, and (ii) the anonymous mechanism group, anonymous reserve and anonymous pricing. Within one group, the involved two mechanisms have an asymptotically tight revenue gap of [math]. In contrast, any two mechanisms from the different groups have an asymptotically tight revenue gap of [math].]]></summary>

In this paper, the dynamics of a single population model with a general growth function is investigated in an advective environment. We show the existence of a nonconstant positive steady state, and give sufficient conditions for the occurrence of a Hopf bifurcation at the positive steady state. Moreover, the theoretical results are applied to the diffusive Nicholson’s blowflies and Mackey–Glass’s models with advection and delay, respectively. We numerically show that the population density decreases as the increase of advection rate or death rate, and a delay-induced Hopf bifurcation is more likely to occur with small advection or low mortality rate.]]></summary>

By generating transient encounters between individuals beyond their immediate social environment, transport can have a profound impact on the spreading of an epidemic. In this work, we consider epidemic dynamics in the presence of the transport process that gives rise to a multiplex network model. In addition to a static layer, the (multiplex) epidemic network consists of a second dynamic layer in which any two individuals are connected for the time they occupy the same site during a random walk they perform on a separate transport network. We develop a mean-field description of the stochastic network model and study the influence the transport process has on the epidemic threshold. We show that any transport process generally lowers the epidemic threshold because of the additional connections it generates. In contrast, considering also random walks of fractional order that in some sense are a more realistic model of human mobility, we find that these non-local transport dynamics raise the epidemic threshold in comparison to a classical local random walk. We also test our model on a realistic transport network (the Munich U-Bahn network), and carefully compare mean-field solutions with stochastic trajectories in a range of scenarios.]]></summary>

Recently, a golden ratio primal-dual algorithm (GRPDA) was proposed by Chang and Yang for solving structured convex optimization problems. It is a new adaptation of the classical Arrow-Hurwicz method by using a convex combination step, instead of the widely adopted extrapolation technique. The convex combination step is determined by a parameter 
                      
                      \(\psi \)
                      
                    , which, to guarantee global convergence, is restricted to 
                      
                      \((1, (1+\sqrt{5})/2]\)
                      
                    . In this paper, by carrying out a refined analysis, we expand this region to 
                      
                      \((1, 1+\sqrt{3})\)
                      
                    . Moreover, we establish ergodic sublinear convergence rate results based on function value residual and constraint violation of an equivalently reformulated constrained optimization problem, rather than the previously adopted so-called primal-dual gap function that could vanish at nonstationary points. For linear equality constrained and regularized least-squares problems, we further show that GRPDA and Chambolle-Pock’s primal-dual algorithm are equivalent provided that some parameters are chosen properly. Finally, experimental results on the LASSO and the basis pursuit problems are presented to demonstrate the performance of GRPDA with

 Abstract. We introduce an end-to-end deep learning architecture called the wide-band butterfly network (WideBNet) for approximating the inverse scattering map from wide-band scattering data. This architecture incorporates tools from computational harmonic analysis, such as the butterfly factorization, and traditional multi-scale methods, such as the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm, to drastically reduce the number of trainable parameters to match the inherent complexity of the problem. As a result, WideBNet is efficient: it requires fewer training points than off-the-shelf architectures and has stable training dynamics which are compatible with standard weight initialization strategies. The architecture automatically adapts to the dimensions of the data with only a few hyper-parameters that the user must specify. WideBNet is able to produce images that are competitive with optimization-based approaches, but at a fraction of the cost, and we also demonstrate numerically that it learns to super-resolve scatterers with a full aperture configuration.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we consider the classical wave equation with time-dependent, spatially multiscale coefficients. We propose a fully discrete computational multiscale method in the spirit of the localized orthogonal decomposition in space with a backward Euler scheme in time. We show optimal convergence rates in space and time beyond the assumptions of spatial periodicity or scale separation of the coefficients. Further, we propose an adaptive update strategy for the time-dependent multiscale basis. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results and showcase the practicability of the adaptive update strategy.]]></summary>

All schoolchildren know how often they breathe, but even experts don’t know exactly why.

Simplified conditions are given for the existence and positivity of wave speed for an integro-difference equation with a strong Allee effect and an unbounded habitat. The results are used to obtain the existence of a critical patch size for an equation with a bounded habitat. It is shown that if the wave speed is positive there exists a critical patch size such that for a habitat size above the critical patch size solutions can persist in space, and if the wave speed is negative solutions always approach zero. An analytical integral formula is developed to determine the critical patch size when the Laplace dispersal kernel is used, and this formula shows existence of multiple equilibrium solutions. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate connections among the wave speed, critical patch size, and Allee threshold.]]></summary>

Atherosclerosis, one of the leading causes of death in USA and worldwide, begins with a lesion in the intima of the arterial wall, allowing LDL to penetrate into the intima where they are oxidized. The immune system considers these oxidized LDL as a dangerous substance and tasks the macrophages to attack them; incapacitated macrophages become foam cells and leads to the formation of a plaque. As the plaque continues to grow, it progressively restricts the blood flow, possibly triggering heart attack or stroke. Because the blood vessels tend to be circular, two-space dimensional cross section model is a good approximation, and the two-space dimensional models are studied in Friedman et al. (J Differ Equ 259(4):1227–1255, 2015) and Zhao and Hu (J Differ Equ 288:250–287, 2021). It is interesting to see whether a true three-space dimensional stationary solution can be developed. We shall establish a three-space dimensional stationary solution for the mathematical model of the initiation and development of atherosclerosis which involves LDL and HDL cholesterols, macrophages and foam cells. The model is a highly nonlinear and coupled system of PDEs with a free boundary, the interface between the plaque and the blood flow. We establish infinite branches of symmetry-breaking stationary solutions which bifurcate from the annular stationary solution in the longitude direction.]]></summary>
