A defining feature of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for ODE is that the piecewise polynomial solution can have a jump discontinuity at the beginning of each step. Starting from the standard integral formulation, the DG method is derived here in differential form. The key ingredient is a polynomial called the correction function, which helps ‘correct’ the discontinuous solution by approximating the jump and yields a continuous one. Under the right Radau quadrature, this continuous solution is shown to be identical to the solutions by the right Radau collocation and the continuous Galerkin (CG) methods. Next, the correction function facilitates the construction of the associated implicit Runge–Kutta schemes (IRK-DG). Different quadratures for DG result in different IRK-DG methods: left Radau quadrature in Radau IA, right Radau quadrature in Radau IIA or right Radau collocation, and Gauss quadrature in a method called DG-Gauss. The construction of IRK-DG via correction function also clarifies the meaning and facilitates the proofs of various

                      \(C(\eta )\)
                      
                    , and

                    , and the IRK-DG methods of Radau type are unique. L-stability of the IRK-DG method is discussed. In all, the correction function plays a key role and helps establish the relations among the DG, IRK-DG, collocation, and CG schemes.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In a stochastic reaction network setting we consider the problem of tracking the fate of individual molecules. We show that by using the classical large volume limit results, we may approximate the dynamics of a single tracked molecule in a simple and computationally efficient way. We give examples on how this approach may be used to obtain various characteristics of single-molecule dynamics (for instance, the distribution of the number of infections in a single individual in the course of an epidemic or the activity time of a single enzyme molecule). Moreover, we show how to approximate the overall dynamics of species of interest in the full system with a collection of independent single-molecule trajectories, and give explicit bounds for the approximation error in terms of the reaction rates. This approximation, which is well defined for all times, leads to an efficient and fully parallelizable simulation technique for which we provide some numerical examples.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we use geometric singular perturbation theory and blowup as our main technical tool to study the mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) that occur in two coupled FitzHugh–Nagumo units with symmetric and repulsive coupling. In particular, we demonstrate that the MMOs in this model are not due to generic folded singularities, but rather due to singularities at a cusp – not a fold – of the critical manifold. Using blowup, we determine the number of small-amplitude oscillations (SAOs) analytically, showing–-as for the folded nodes–-that they are determined by the Weber equation and the ratio of eigenvalues. We also show that the model undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation in the desingularized reduced problem, which–-although resembling a folded saddle-node (type II) at this level–-also occurs on a cusp, and not a fold. We demonstrate that this bifurcation is associated with the emergence of an invariant cylinder, the onset of SAOs, as well as SAOs of increasing amplitude. We relate our findings with numerical computations and find excellent agreement.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We analyze a class of stochastic processes, referred to as asynchronous and semianonymous dynamics (ASD), over directed labeled random networks. These processes are a natural tool to describe general best-response and noisy best-response dynamics in network games where each agent, at random times governed by independent Poisson clocks, can choose among a finite set of actions. The payoff is determined by the relative frequency of the different actions among neighbors while being independent of the specific identities of neighbors. Using a local mean-field approach, we prove rigorously that, under certain conditions on the network and initial node configuration, the evolution of ASD can be approximated, in the large-scale limit, by the solution of a system of nonlinear ODEs. Our framework is very general and applies to a large class of graph ensembles for which the typical random graph is locally tree-like. In particular, we focus on labeled configuration-model random graphs, a generalization of the traditional configuration model which allows different classes of nodes to be mixed together in the network, permitting us, for example, to incorporate a community structure in the system. Our analysis also applies to configuration-model graphs having a power-law degree distribution, an essential feature of many real systems. To demonstrate the power and flexibility of our framework, we consider several examples of dynamics belonging to our class of stochastic processes. Moreover, we illustrate by simulation the applicability of our analysis to realistic scenarios by running our example dynamics over a real social network graph.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Reaction networks can display a wide array of dynamics. However, it is possible for different reaction networks to display the same dynamics. This phenomenon is called dynamical equivalence and makes network identification a hard problem. We show that to find a strongly endotactic/endotactic/consistent/conservative realization (when it exists) that is dynamically equivalent to the mass-action system generated by a given network it suffices to consider only the source vertices of the given network. In addition, we show that weakly reversible deficiency one realizations are not unique. We also present a characterization of the dynamical relationships that exist between several types of weakly reversible deficiency one networks.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Under the assumption of mass-action kinetics, a dynamical system may be induced by several different reaction networks and/or parameters. It is therefore possible for a mass-action system to exhibit complex-balancing dynamics without being weakly reversible or satisfying toric constraints on the rate constants; such systems are called disguised toric dynamical systems. We show that the parameters that give rise to such systems are preserved under invertible affine transformations of the network. We also consider the dynamics of arbitrary mass-action systems under affine transformations and show that there is a canonical bijection between their sets of positive steady states, although their qualitative dynamics can differ substantially.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the cardinality of collisions between Kuramoto oscillators in the (asymptotic) phase-locking process in the presence of inertia. In the absence of inertia, it has been known that the finiteness of collisions between oscillators is equivalent to the emergence of phase-locking. Thus, a natural question is whether this finiteness result is still valid for the Kuramoto model with inertia or not. In a small inertia regime, we show that the finiteness of collisions is also equivalent to phase-locking like the Kuramoto model. In contrast, in a large inertia regime, we show that a homogeneous Kuramoto ensemble with the same natural frequency can exhibit phase-locking, while there are a countable number of collisions between Kuramoto oscillators. This is the contrasted effect of a large inertia in the phase-locking process.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Koopman analysis provides a general theoretical underpinning for widely used dynamic mode decomposition algorithms which approximate the behavior of a nonlinear dynamical system using a linear operator. While such methods have proven to be remarkably useful in the analysis of time-series data, the resulting linear models must generally be of high order to accurately approximate fundamentally nonlinear behaviors. This issue poses an inherent risk of overfitting to training data, thereby limiting predictive capabilities. By contrast, this work explores strategies for nonlinear data-driven system identification using strategies inspired by Koopman analysis. General strategies that yield nonlinear models are presented for systems both with and without control. Subsequent projection of the resulting nonlinear equations onto a low-rank basis yields a low-order representation for the underlying dynamical system. In both computational and experimental examples considered in this work, linear estimators of the Koopman operator are generally only able to provide short-term predictions for the observable dynamics, while comparable nonlinear estimators for the system dynamics provide accurate predictions on substantially longer timescales and replicate infinite-time behaviors that linear predictors cannot.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We propose finite-volume schemes for general continuity equations which preserve positivity and global bounds that arise from saturation effects in the mobility function. In the case of gradient flows, the schemes dissipate the free energy at the fully discrete level. Moreover, these schemes are generalized to coupled systems of nonlinear continuity equations, such as multispecies models in mathematical physics or biology, preserving the bounds and the dissipation of the energy whenever applicable. These results are illustrated through extensive numerical simulations which explore known behaviors in biology and showcase new phenomena not yet described by the literature.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The mystery of soaring birds, such as albatrosses and eagles, has intrigued biologists, physicists, aeronautical/control engineers, and applied mathematicians for centuries. These fascinating avian organisms are able to fly for long durations while expending little to no energy, utilizing wind to gain lift. This flight technique/maneuver is called dynamic soaring (DS). For biologists and physicists, the DS phenomenon is nothing but a wonder of the very elegant ability of these birds to interact with nature and use its physical ether in an optimal way for better survival and energy efficiency. For the engineering community, the DS phenomenon is a source of inspiration and an unequivocal opportunity for biomimicking. Mathematic…]]></summary>

A large class of differential Riccati equations (DREs) satisfy positivity property in the sense that the time-dependent solution preserves for any time its symmetric and positive semidefinite structure. This positivity property plays a crucial role in understanding the wellposedness of the DRE, and whether it could be inherited in the discrete level is a significant issue in numerical simulations. In this paper, we study positivity preserving time integration schemes by means of exponential integrators. The proposed exponential Euler and exponential midpoint schemes are linear and proven to be positivity preserving and unconditionally stable. Sharp error estimates of the schemes are also obtained. Numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the performance of the proposed integrators.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In many applications it is required to determine a parameters set which is suitable for competing models. To this end, we are interested in ensemble methods to solve multiobjective optimization problems. Here, the ensemble Kalman Filter method is applied and adapted in order to solve coupled inverse nonlinear problems using a weighted function approach. An analysis of the mean field limit of the ensemble method yields an explicit update formula for the weights. Numerical examples show the improved performance of the proposed method.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Feedback-based control of dynamical systems enables tracking of unstable branches that cannot be reached by the free evolution of a simulated or physical system. As the stationary points are stabilized with these control methods, the stability information on the original system gets lost in the data from the transient behavior reaching these equilibria. We introduce, by means of a physical experiment of the Zeeman catastrophe machine, a method to construct the whole bifurcation diagram including stability information about the underlying uncontrolled equilibria and the location of bifurcation points.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We provide a discrete weak KAM method for finding solutions of a class of first-order stationary mean field games systems. Especially, such solutions have clear dynamical meaning. First, we discretize Lax–Oleinik equations by discretizing in time, and then we prove the existence of minimizing holonomic measures for mean field games. We obtain two sequences of solutions [math] of discrete Lax–Oleinik equations and minimizing holonomic measures [math] for mean field games and show that [math] converges to a solution of the stationary mean field games systems. Finally, we briefly describe how to implement a discretization in the space variable also.]]></summary>

The fractal mobile/immobile model bridges between Fickian fluxes at early times and non-Gaussian behavior at late times. In this work, an averaged L1 scheme for solving the fractal mobile/immobile Allen–Cahn equation with a Caputo temporal derivative of order 
                      
                      \(\alpha \in (0,1)\)
                      
                     is developed and analyzed on graded meshes. The unique solvability and discrete energy stability are established rigorously on arbitrary nonuniform time meshes. Based on the spectral norm inequality, the unconditional stability and the second-order convergence analysis under the weakly regularity assumption are investigated on graded meshes. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first topic on the convergence analysis for the fractal mobile/immobile Allen–Cahn equation on graded meshes.]]></summary>

However, the Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM)-based algorithm used in [33] lacks the convergence guarantee. In this work, we propose an iterative support shrinking algorithm with proximal linearization for multi-phase image labeling problems, which is theoretically proven to be globally convergent. A key step is that we prove a lower bound theory for the nonzero entries of the gradient of the iterative sequence when both box constraint and simplex constraint are involved in the target energy minimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical attempt at the non-Lipschitz piecewise constant Mumford–Shah model. Numerical experiments are conducted on both two-phase and multi-phase labeling problems to indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.]]></summary>

Square-root Lasso problems have already be shown to be robust regression problems. Furthermore, square-root regression problems with structured sparsity also plays an important role in statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we focus on the numerical computation of large-scale linearly constrained sparse group square-root Lasso problems. In order to overcome the difficulty that there are two nonsmooth terms in the objective function, we propose a dual semismooth Newton (SSN) based augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) for it. That is, we apply the ALM to the dual problem with the subproblem solved by the SSN method. To apply the SSN method, the positive definiteness of the generalized Jacobian is very important. Hence we characterize the equivalence of its positive definiteness and the constraint nondegeneracy condition of the corresponding primal problem. In numerical implementation, we fully employ the second order sparsity so that the Newton direction can be efficiently obtained. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.]]></summary>

We consider a slightly modified local finite-volume approximation of the Laplacian operator originally proposed by Chandrashekar (Int J Adv Eng Sci Appl Math 8(3):174–193, 2016, https://doi.org/10.1007/s12572-015-0160-z). The goal is to prove consistency and convergence of the approximation on unstructured grids. Consequently, we propose a semi-discrete scheme for the heat equation augmented with Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions. By deriving a priori estimates for the numerical solution, we prove that it converges weakly, and subsequently strongly, to a weak solution of the original problem. A numerical simulation demonstrates that the scheme converges with a second-order rate.]]></summary>

Projected gradient descent and its Riemannian variant belong to a typical class of methods for low-rank matrix estimation. This paper proposes a new Nesterov’s Accelerated Riemannian Gradient algorithm using efficient orthographic retraction and tangent space projection. The subspace relationship between iterative and extrapolated sequences on the low-rank matrix manifold provides computational convenience. With perturbation analysis of truncated singular value decomposition and two retractions, we systematically analyze the local convergence of gradient algorithms and Nesterov’s variants in the Euclidean and Riemannian settings. Theoretically, we estimate the exact rate of local linear convergence under different parameters using the spectral radius in a closed form and give the optimal convergence rate and the corresponding momentum parameter. When the parameter is unknown, the adaptive restart scheme can avoid the oscillation problem caused by high momentum, thus approaching the optimal convergence rate. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the estimations of convergence rate and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive with first-order methods for matrix completion and matrix sensing.]]></summary>

A stabilized element-free Galerkin (EFG) method is developed and analyzed in this paper for the meshless numerical solution of Stokes problems. To accelerate the solution procedure and recover the optimal convergence impaired by Gauss integration, integration constraints of Galerkin numerical methods for Stokes problems are derived, and then the inherently consistent reproducing kernel gradient smoothing integration is incorporated into the EFG method with explicit quadrature rules in the reference space. By using Nitsche’s method to satisfy the Dirichlet boundary condition, the inf-sup stability, the existence and uniqueness, and the error estimation of the EFG solution with numerical integration are derived rigorously. Theoretical results reveal that the EFG error essentially comes from not only the meshless approximations of velocity and pressure, but also numerical integration of the Galerkin weak forms. It turns out a procedure on how to choose quadrature rules to ensure that the optimal convergence is not affected by the integration error. Numerical results demonstrate the consistency, efficiency and optimal convergence of the method, and support the theoretical results.]]></summary>

In this study, we propose a unified, general framework for the direct discontinuous Galerkin methods. In the new framework, the antiderivative of the nonlinear diffusion matrix is not needed. This allows a simple definition of the numerical flux, which can be used for general diffusion equations with no further modification. We also present the nonlinear stability analyses of the new direct discontinuous Galerkin methods and perform several numerical experiments to evaluate their performance. The numerical tests show that the symmetric and the interface correction versions of the method achieve optimal convergence and are superior to the nonsymmetric version, which demonstrates optimal convergence only for problems with diagonal diffusion matrices but loses order for even degree polynomials with a non-diagonal diffusion matrix. Singular or blow up solutions are also well captured with the new direct discontinuous Galerkin methods.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We address the problem of approximating the moments of the solution, [math], of an Itô stochastic differential equation (SDE) with drift and diffusion terms over a time grid [math]. In particular, we assume an explicit numerical scheme for the generation of sample paths [math] and then obtain recursive equations that yield any desired noncentral moment of [math] as a function of the initial condition [math]. The core of the methodology is the decomposition of the numerical solution [math] into a “central part” and an “effective noise” term. The central term is computed deterministically from the ordinary differential equation (ODE) that results from eliminating the diffusion term in the SDE, while the effective noise accounts for the stochastic deviation from the numerical solution of the ODE. For simplicity, we describe the proposed methodology based on an Euler–Maruyama integrator, but other explicit numerical schemes can be exploited in the same way. We also apply the moment approximations to construct estimates of the 1-dimensional marginal probability density functions of [math] based on a Gram–Charlier expansion. Both for the approximation of moments and 1-dimensional densities, we describe how to handle the cases in which the initial condition is fixed (i.e., [math] for some deterministic and known [math]) or random. In the latter case, we resort to polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) schemes in order to approximate the target moments. The methodology has been inspired by the PCE and differential algebra methods used for uncertainty propagation in astrodynamics problems. Hence, we illustrate its application for the quantification of uncertainty in a 2-dimensional Keplerian orbit perturbed by a Wiener noise process.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We consider the dynamics of a droplet on a vibrating fluid bath. This hydrodynamic quantum analogue system is shown to elicit the canonical behavior of damped-driven systems, including a period doubling route to chaos. By approximating the system as a compositional map between the gain and loss dynamics, the underlying nonlinear dynamics can be shown to be driven by energy balances in the systems. The gain-loss iterative mapping is similar to a normal form encoding for the pattern forming instabilities generated in such spatially extended systems. Similar to mode-locked lasers and rotating detonation engines, the underlying bifurcations persist for general forms of the loss and gain, both of which admit explicit representations in our approximation. Moreover, the resulting geometrical description of the particle-wave interaction completely characterizes the instabilities observed in experiments.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we describe two effects of the Lévy area correction on the invariant measure of stochastic rigid body dynamics on geometric rough paths. From the viewpoint of dynamics, the Lévy area correction introduces an additional deterministic torque into the rigid body motion equation on geometric rough paths. When the rigid body dynamics is driven by colored noise, and damped by double-bracket dissipation, our theoretical and numerical results show that the additional deterministic torque due to the the Lévy area correction shifts the center of the probability distribution function by shifting the Hamiltonian function in the exponent of the Gibbsian invariant measure.]]></summary>

We use reduction and averaging theory, as well as the technique of continuation of Poincaré, for the study of symmetric periodic solutions. Moreover, the determination of KAM 2-tori encasing some of the linearly stable periodic solutions is proved.

 Abstract. This work makes explicit the degrees of freedom involved in modeling the dynamics of a network, or some other first-order property of a network, such as a measurement function. In previous work, an admissible function in a network was constructed through the evaluation of what we called oracle components. These oracle components are defined through some minimal properties that they are expected to obey. This is a high-level description in the sense that it is not clear how one could design such an object. The goal is to obtain a low-level representation of these objects by unwrapping them into their degrees of freedom. To achieve this, we introduce two decompositions. The first one is the more intuitive one and allows us to define the important concept of coupling order. The second decomposition is built on top of the first one and is valid for the class of coupling components that have finite coupling order. Despite this requirement, we show that this is still a very useful tool for designing coupling components with infinite coupling orders, through a limit approach.]]></summary>

Abstract.We consider a nonlinear chain of coupled oscillators, which is a direct generalization of the classical Fermi–Pasta–Ulam (FPU) lattice and exhibits, besides the usual nearest neighbor interaction, also next-to-nearest neighbor interaction. For the case of nearest neighbor attraction and next-to-nearest neighbor repulsion we prove that such a lattice admits, in contrast to the classical FPU model, moving modulating front solutions of permanent form, which have small converging tails at infinity and can be approximated by solitary wave solutions of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. When the associated potentials are even, then the proof yields moving modulating pulse solutions of permanent form, whose profiles are spatially localized. Our analysis employs the spatial dynamics approach as developed by Iooss and Kirchgässner. The relevant solutions are constructed on a five-dimensional center manifold, and their persistence is guaranteed by reversibility arguments.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This study formally adapts the time-domain linear sampling method (TLSM) for ultrasonic imaging of stationary and evolving fractures in safety-critical components. The TLSM indicator is then applied to the laboratory test data of [F. Pourahmadian and H. Yue, Inverse Problems, 37 (2021), 055012; F. Pourahmadian, Mech. Syst. Signal Process., 161 (2021), 108029] and the obtained reconstructions are compared to their frequency-domain counterparts. The results highlight the unique capability of the time-domain imaging functional for high-fidelity tracking of evolving damage, and its relative robustness to sparse and reduced-aperture data at moderate noise levels. A comparative analysis of the TLSM images against the multifrequency LSM maps of [F. Pourahmadian and H. Yue, Inverse Problems, 37 (2021), 055012] further reveals that thanks to the full-waveform inversion in time and space, the TLSM generates images of remarkably higher quality with the same dataset.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We provide finite sample guarantees for the classical Chow–Liu algorithm [Chow and Liu, IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 14 (1968), pp. 462–467] to learn a tree-structured graphical model of a distribution. For a distribution [math] on [math] and a tree [math] on [math] nodes, we say [math] is an [math]-approximate tree for [math] if there is a [math]-structured distribution [math] such that [math] is at most [math] more than the best possible tree-structured distribution for [math]. We show that if [math] itself is tree-structured, then the Chow–Liu algorithm with the plug-in estimator for mutual information with [math] independent and identically distributed samples outputs an [math]-approximate tree for [math] with constant probability. In contrast, for a general [math] (which may not be tree-structured), [math] samples are necessary to find an [math]-approximate tree. Our upper bound is based on a new conditional independence tester that addresses an open problem posed by Canonne et al. [Proceedings of the 50th Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM, 2018, pp. 735–748]: we prove that for three random variables [math] each over [math], testing if [math] is 0 or [math] is possible with [math] samples. Finally, we show that for a specific tree [math], with [math] samples from a distribution [math] over [math], one can efficiently learn the closest [math]-structured distribution in KL divergence by applying the add-1 estimator at each node.]]></summary>

In this paper, we propose and analyze an efficient spectral-Galerkin method based on a mixed formulation with dimension reduction for the Helmholtz transmission eigenvalue problem in spherical domains. By introducing an auxiliary function, we rewrite the original problem as an equivalent fourth-order coupled form in spherical coordinates. Using the properties of spherical harmonic and Laplace–Beltrami operator, we further decompose the original problem into a series of decoupled one-dimensional fourth-order linear eigenvalue problems, for which a new mixed variational formulation and its discretization is developed. For error estimates of numerical eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, we recall the spectral theory of compact operators. Towards this end, we derive the essential polar conditions, define a class of weighted Sobolev spaces, and most importantly, prove a sequence of two compact embedding properties for the weighted Sobolev spaces, based on which the spectral theory of compact operators for the variational formulation and discrete system can be established. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to confirm the theoretical error analysis and the efficiency of our algorithm.]]></summary>

In this paper, the stability analysis and optimal error estimates are presented for a kind of fully discrete schemes for solving one-dimensional linear convection–diffusion equation with periodic boundary conditions. The fully discrete schemes are defined with local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) spatial discretization methods coupled with implicit–explicit (IMEX) temporal discretization methods based on backward difference formulas (BDF). By combining an improved multiplier technique used in the stability analysis for multistep methods and the technique to deal with derivative and jump in LDG methods, we establish a general framework of stability analysis for the corresponding fully discrete LDG–IMEX–BDF schemes up to fifth order in time. The considered schemes are proved to be unconditionally stable, in the sense that a properly defined “discrete energy” is dissipative if the time step is upper bounded by a constant which is independent of the mesh size.

We propose a novel class of arbitrarily high-order mass or energy conservative numerical schemes for the generalized Benjamin–Ono equation on the whole real line. The spatial discretization is achieved by the pseudo-spectral method with the rational basis functions. By reformulating the spatial discretized system into the different equivalent forms, either the spatial semi-discretized mass or energy can be preserved exactly under the continuous time flow. Combined with the symplectic Runge–Kutta, with or without the scalar auxiliary variable reformulation, the fully discrete (space-time discrete sense) energy or mass conservative schemes can be constructed with arbitrarily high-order temporal accuracy, respectively. Our numerical results show the conservation of the proposed schemes, and also the superior accuracy and stability to the non-conservative (Leap-frog) scheme.]]></summary>

We study a class of constrained sparse optimization problems with cardinality penalty, where the feasible set is defined by box constraint, and the loss function is convex but not necessarily smooth. First, we propose an accelerated smoothing hard thresholding (ASHT) algorithm for solving such problems, which combines smoothing approximation, extrapolation technique and iterative hard thresholding method. The extrapolation coefficients can be chosen to satisfy 
                      
                      \(\sup _k \beta _k=1\)
                      
                    . We discuss the convergence of ASHT algorithm with different extrapolation coefficients, and give a sufficient condition to ensure that any accumulation point of the iterates is a local minimizer of the original problem. For a class of special updating schemes on the extrapolation coefficients, we obtain that the iterates are convergent to a local minimizer of the problem, and the convergence rate is 
                      
                      \(o(\ln ^{\sigma } k/k)\)

Second, we consider the case in which the loss function is Lipschitz continuously differentiable, and develop an accelerated hard thresholding (AHT) algorithm to solve it. We prove that the iterates of AHT algorithm converge to a local minimizer of the problem that satisfies a desirable lower bound property.

 Abstract. In this paper, we study a stochastic optimization control problem for carbon emission reduction with two control variables, one of which is the stochastic emission reduction control strategy, and the other is the auction amount of carbon allowances. We optimize the total emission reduction cost by a two- step process. Fixing the auction amount, we optimize the emission reduction control strategy, and then relate the value function to a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. The existence and uniqueness of the classical solution of the equation are proved so as to describe the optimal control strategy. After that, we find the optimal auction amount by determining the zero point of the derivative. We then show that the auction amount minimizing the total cost is unique in a special case. Finally, the relationships between the optimal auction amount and the total cost and various parameters are discussed through numerical results.]]></summary>
