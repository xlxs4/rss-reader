 Abstract. How morphogenesis depends on cell properties is an active direction of research. Here, we focus on mechanical models of growing plant tissues, where microscopic (sub)cellular structure is taken into account. In order to establish links between microscopic and macroscopic tissue properties, we perform a multiscale analysis of a model of growing plant tissue with subcellular resolution. We use homogenization to rigorously derive the corresponding macroscopic tissue-scale model. Tissue-scale mechanical properties are computed from microscopic structural and material properties, taking into account deformation by the growth field. We then consider case studies and numerically compare the detailed microscopic model and the tissue-scale model, both implemented using the finite element method. We find that the macroscopic model can be used to efficiently make predictions about several configurations of interest. Our work will help making links between microscopic measurements and macroscopic observations in growing tissues.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In an epidemic network, lags due to travel time between populations, latent period, and recovery period can significantly change the epidemic behavior and result in successive echoing waves of the spread between various population clusters. Moreover, external shocks to a given population can propagate to other populations within the network, potentially snowballing into waves of resurgent epidemics. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of time delay and small shocks/uncertainties on the linear susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) dynamics of epidemic networks. In this regard, the asymptotic stability of this class of networks is first studied, and then its …]]></summary>

 Abstract.The deep linear network (DLN) is a model for implicit regularization in gradient based optimization of overparametrized learning architectures. Training the DLN corresponds to a Riemannian gradient flow, where the Riemannian metric is defined by the architecture of the network and the loss function is defined by the learning task. We extend this geometric framework, obtaining explicit expressions for the volume form, including the case when the network has infinite depth. We investigate the link between the Riemannian geometry and the training asymptotics for matrix completion with rigorous analysis and numerics. We propose that under small initialization, implicit regularization is a result of bias towards high state space volume.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Social interactions often occur between three or more agents simultaneously. Examining opinion dynamics on hypergraphs allows one to study the effect of such polyadic interactions on the opinions of agents. In this paper, we consider a bounded-confidence model (BCM), in which opinions take continuous values and interacting agents comprise their opinions if they are close enough to each other. We study a density description of a Deffuant–Weisbuch BCM on hypergraphs. We derive a rate equation for the mean-field opinion density as the number of agents becomes infinite, and we prove that this rate equation yields a probability density that converges to noninteracting opinion clusters. Using numerical simulations, we examine bifurcations of the density-based BCM’s steady-state opinion clusters and demonstrate that the agent-based BCM converges to the density description of the BCM as the number of agents becomes infinite.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Many networked systems are governed by non-pairwise interactions between nodes. The resulting higher-order interaction structure can then be encoded by means of a hypernetwork. In this paper we consider dynamical systems on hypernetworks by defining a class of admissible maps for every such hypernetwork. We explain how to classify robust cluster synchronization patterns on hypernetworks by finding balanced partitions, and we generalize the concept of a graph fibration to the hypernetwork context. We also show that robust synchronization patterns are only fully determined by polynomial admissible maps of high order. This means that, unlike in dyadic networks, cluster synchronization on hypernetworks is a higher-order, i.e., nonlinear, effect. We give a formula, in terms of the order of the hypernetwork, for the degree of the polynomial admissible maps that determine robust synchronization patterns. We also demonstrate that this degree is optimal by investigating a class of examples. We conclude by demonstrating how this effect may cause remarkable synchrony breaking bifurcations that occur at high polynomial degree.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The constructive theory of analytical higher-order contrast bounds for the effective constants of dispersed conducting and piezoelectric fibrous composites is developed. The lower-order bounds, e.g., Wiener and Hashin–Shtrikman bounds, are universal for composites but do not take into account interactions among inclusions corresponding to their location. To study the variety of dispersed random composites, we use computationally effective structural sums directly relating the location of inclusions to the effective constants. The present paper is the first report where the structural sums are applied to higher-order contrast bounds instead of the virtually impossible in computation multipoint correlation functions. We concentrate our attention on two-phase conducting fibrous composites. Rylko’s matrix decomposition is used for the higher-order contrast bounds to extend the obtained analytical bounds to piezoelectric fibrous composites. The supplementary materials contain the results of numerical-symbolic computations, the long analytical formulas for the effective constants and bounds up to [math], where [math] stands for concentration.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study order reconstruction (OR) solutions in the Beris–Edwards framework for nematodynamics, for both passive and active nematic flows in a microfluidic channel. OR solutions exhibit polydomains and domain walls, and as such, are of physical interest. We show that OR solutions exist for passive flows with constant velocity and pressure, but only for specific boundary conditions. We prove the existence of unique, symmetric, and nonsingular nematic profiles for boundary conditions that do not allow for OR solutions. We compute asymptotic expansions for OR-type solutions for passive flows with nonconstant velocity and pressure, and active flows, which shed light on the internal structure of domain walls. The asymptotics are complemented by numerical studies that demonstrate the universality of OR-type structures in static and dynamic scenarios.]]></summary>

The fully-connected tensor network (FCTN) decomposition is an emerging method for processing and analyzing higher-order tensors. For an Nth-order tensor, the standard deterministic algorithms, such as alternating least squares (FCTN-ALS) algorithm, need to store large coefficient matrices formed by contracting 
                      
                      \(N-1\)
                      
                     FCTN factor tensors. The memory cost of coefficient matrices grows exponentially with the size of the original tensor, which makes the algorithms memory-prohibitive for handling large-scale tensors. To enable FCTN decomposition to handle large-scale tensors effectively, we propose a stochastic gradient descent (FCTN-SGD) algorithm without sacrificing accuracy. The memory cost of FCTN-SGD algorithm grows linearly with the size of the original tensor and is significantly lower than that of the FCTN-ALS algorithm. The success of the FCTN-SGD algorithm lies in the suggested factor sampling operator, which cleverly avoids storing large coefficient matrices in the algorithm. By using the suggested operator, sampling on small factor tensors is equal to sampling on large coefficient matrices with a theoretical guarantee. Furthermore, we present an FCTN-VRSGD algorithm by introducing variance reduction into the FCTN-SGD algorithm, and theoretically prove the convergence of the FCTN-VRSGD algorithm under a mild assumption. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed FCTN-SGD and FCTN-VRSGD algorithms, especially for real-world large-scale tensors.]]></summary>

We construct a high-order (cubic) Hermite finite volume method (FVM-2L) with a two-layered dual strategy on triangular meshes, which possesses the conservation laws in both flux form and equation form. In particular, for problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions, the FVM-2L scheme preserves conservation laws on all triangles, whereas conservation properties may be lost on boundary dual elements by existing vertex-centered finite volume schemes. Theoretically, this is the first

Wearables, equipped with various sensing technologies (e.g., accelerometer for movement, optics for heart rate), are increasingly being recognised for their expansive potential in (remote) patient monitoring, diagnostics, and therapeutic applications which suggests a plausible move towards a more decentralised healthcare system. This shift is evident as healthcare providers and patients alike are becoming increasingly accepting of wearable-driven tools, as they enable continuous health monitoring outside of traditional clinical settings. Equally, the ubiquitous nature of smartphones, now more than mere communication tools, is being harnessed to serve as pivotal health monitoring instruments. Their added sensing capabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) driven connectivity enable a (relatively) seamless transition from conventional health practices to a more interconnected, digital age. However, this evolving landscape is not without its challenges, with concerns surrounding data privacy, security, and ensuring equitable access to digital advances. As we delve deeper into digital healthcare, we must harness the full potential of those technologies and ensure their ethical and equitable implementation, envisioning a future where healthcare is not just hospital-centric but is part of our daily lives.]]></summary>

Inverse obstacle scattering is the recovery of an obstacle boundary from the scattering data produced by incident waves. This shape recovery can be done by iteratively solving a PDE-constrained optimization problem for the obstacle boundary. While it is well known that this problem is typically non-convex and ill-posed, previous investigations have shown that in many settings these issues can be alleviated by using a continuation-in-frequency method and introducing a regularization that limits the frequency content of the obstacle boundary. It has been recently observed that these techniques can fail for obstacles with pronounced cavities, even in the case of penetrable obstacles where similar optimization and regularization methods work for the equivalent problem of recovering a piecewise constant wave speed. The present work investigates the recovery of obstacle boundaries for impenetrable, sound-soft media with pronounced cavities, given multi-frequency scattering data. Numerical examples demonstrate that the problem is sensitive to the choice of iterative solver used at each frequency and the initial guess at the lowest frequency. We propose a modified continuation-in-frequency method which follows a random walk in frequency, as opposed to the standard monotonically increasing path. This method shows some increased robustness in recovering cavities, but can also fail for more extreme examples. An interesting phenomenon is observed that while the obstacle reconstructions obtained over several random trials can vary significantly near the cavity, the results are consistent for non-cavity parts of the boundary.]]></summary>

It has long been known that second order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equations with nonoscillatory coefficients admit nonoscillatory phase functions. This observation is the basis of many techniques for the asymptotic approximation of the solutions of such equations, as well as several schemes for their numerical solution. However, it was only relatively recently exploited to develop the first high-accuracy numerical solver for second order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equations which runs in time independent of frequency. Here, we introduce the first high-accuracy, frequency-independent method for the numerical solution of second order linear inhomogeneous ordinary differential equations. Our algorithm operates by constructing a nonoscillatory phase function representing the solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equation. Then, it uses an adaptive Levin scheme to construct a collection of auxiliary nonoscillatory functions that efficiently represent a highly oscillatory indefinite integral giving a particular solution of the inhomogeneous differential equation. Once the phase function and these auxiliary functions have been constructed, the inhomogeneous equation can be solved subject to essentially any reasonable boundary conditions. The results of numerical experiments illustrating the properties of our scheme are discussed.]]></summary>

We investigate the use of models from the theory of regularity structures as features in machine learning tasks. A model is a polynomial function of a space–time signal designed to well-approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), even in low regularity regimes. Models can be seen as natural multi-dimensional generalisations of signatures of paths; our work therefore aims to extend the recent use of signatures in data science beyond the context of time-ordered data. We provide a flexible definition of a model feature vector associated to a space–time signal, along with two algorithms which illustrate ways in which these features can be combined with linear regression. We apply these algorithms in several numerical experiments designed to learn solutions to PDEs with a given forcing and boundary data. Our experiments include semi-linear parabolic and wave equations with forcing, and Burgers’ equation with no forcing. We find an advantage in favour of our algorithms when compared to several alternative methods. Additionally, in the experiment with Burgers’ equation, we find non-trivial predictive power when noise is added to the observations.]]></summary>

This paper analyses the long-time behaviour of one-stage symplectic or symmetric trigonometric integrators when applied to nonlinear wave equations. It is shown that energy, momentum, and all harmonic actions are approximately preserved over a long time for one-stage explicit symplectic or symmetric trigonometric integrators when applied to nonlinear wave equations via spectral semi-discretisations. For the long-term analysis of symplectic or symmetric trigonometric integrators, we derive a multi-frequency modulated Fourier expansion of the trigonometric integrator and show three almost-invariants of the modulation system. In the analysis of this paper, we neither assume symmetry for symplectic methods, nor assume symplecticity for symmetric methods. The results for symplectic and symmetric methods are obtained as a byproduct of the above analysis. We also give another proof by establishing a relationship between symplectic and symmetric trigonometric integrators and trigonometric integrators which have been researched for wave equations in the literature.]]></summary>

Preconditioning techniques have been focused on multi-linear systems or tensor equations. However, to our knowledge, there is no relevant research on tensor complementarity problems.

                     and a vector q, and we prove that the TCP
                      
                      \(({\mathcal {A}},q)\)
                      
                     is equivalent to the TCP
                      
                      \((P{\mathcal {A}},Pq)\)
                      
                     under the assumption that

                    -tensor. Based on this equivalence, a preconditioned fixed point iteration method is proposed for solving the tensor complementarity problem and its convergence analysis is given. For actual computations, we provide a concrete choice for the preconditioner P associated with a parameter satisfying above-mentioned hypothesis. In addition, it is proved theoretically that the convergence rate of the fixed point method with the chosen preconditioner P is at least as fast as that of the corresponding method without preprocessing. Meanwhile, we also obtain the monotony of the parameter on the performance of the preconditioned iterative method. Lastly, numerical examples are used to demonstrate the theoretical results.]]></summary>

Wasserstein–Fisher–Rao (WFR) distance is a family of metrics to gauge the discrepancy of two Radon measures, which takes into account both transportation and weight change. Spherical WFR distance is a projected version of WFR distance for probability measures so that the space of Radon measures equipped with WFR can be viewed as metric cone over the space of probability measures with spherical WFR. Compared to the case for Wasserstein distance, the understanding of geodesics under the spherical WFR is less clear and still an ongoing research focus. In this paper, we develop a deep learning framework to compute the geodesics under the spherical WFR metric, and the learned geodesics can be adopted to generate weighted samples. Our approach is based on a Benamou–Brenier type dynamic formulation for spherical WFR. To overcome the difficulty in enforcing the boundary constraint brought by the weight change, a Kullback–Leibler divergence term based on the inverse map is introduced into the cost function. Moreover, a new regularization term using the particle velocity is introduced as a substitute for the Hamilton–Jacobi equation for the potential in dynamic formula. When used for sample generation, our framework can be beneficial for applications with given weighted samples, especially in the Bayesian inference, compared to sample generation with previous flow models.]]></summary>

Currently, when the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations are solved using turbulence modelling, most often the one-equation model of Spalart and Allmaras is used. Then, it is only necessary to solve the RANS equations in conjunction with a single transport equation for modeling turbulence. For this model, considerable assessment and analysis has been performed, allowing the possibility of a reliable solution method for an eddy viscosity required to compute the Reynolds stresses in the RANS equations. Such evaluation along with analysis has not been performed for similar performance with two-equation models of the

A novel domain decomposition method is proposed in this paper to solve eigenvalue problems. Both the simple and multiple eigenvalues are considered in algorithm design and theoretical analysis. The key thought is to transform the eigenvalue problem into a number of linear boundary value problems in a multilevel space sequence and some small-scale eigenvalue problems in a low-dimensional correction space. Then some well-developed domain decomposition methods for linear boundary value problem can be directly used to resolve eigenvalue problems. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we can find the presented novel domain decomposition algorithm for eigenvalue problems can derive the same solving efficiency and parallel scalability as that for linear boundary value problems.]]></summary>

In this paper, we are concerned with a class of structured optimization problems frequently arising from image processing and statistical learning, where the objective function is the sum of a quadratic term and a nonsmooth part, and the constraint set consists of a linear equality constraint and two simple convex sets in the sense that projections onto simple sets are easy to compute. To fully exploit the quadratic and separable structure of the problem under consideration, we accordingly propose a partially inertial Douglas–Rachford splitting method. It is noteworthy that our algorithm enjoys easy subproblems for the case where the underlying two simple convex sets are not the whole spaces. Theoretically, we establish the global convergence of the proposed algorithm under some mild conditions. A series of computational results on the constrained Lasso and constrained total-variation (TV) based image restoration demonstrate that our proposed method is competitive with some state-of-the-art first-order solvers.]]></summary>

With the aim to continue developing a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method for problems arisen from photovoltaic cells modeling, in this manuscript we consider the time harmonic Maxwell’s equations in an inhomogeneous bounded bi-periodic domain with quasi-periodic conditions on part of the boundary. We propose an HDG scheme where quasi-periodic boundary conditions are imposed on the numerical trace space.

An a posteriori error estimator for an energy norm is also proposed. We show that it is reliable and locally efficient under certain conditions.

Thresholding-based methods are widely used for sparse optimization problems in many applications including compressive sensing, image processing, and machine learning. However, the hard thresholding method may converge slowly or diverge for many practical problems. In this paper, we propose a scaled proximal gradient method for solving sparse optimization problems, where the scaled matrix can take a varying positive diagonal for connecting the residual reduction. The global convergence of the proposed method is established under some mild assumptions without the restricted isometry property condition. We also present a scaled proximal pursuit and a modified scaled proximal gradient method with global convergence under the restricted isometry property. Finally, some numerical tests are reported to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methods over the classical thresholding-based methods.]]></summary>

In this paper, we explore the special structure of kernel matrices by defining and utilizing the properties of the Lower-ColLinear Triangular Matrix (L-CoLT matrix) and Upper-ColLinear Triangular Matrix (U-CoLT matrix). We prove that (1) L/U-CoLT matrix–vector multiplications can be carried out in O(N) operations; (2) both families of matrices are closed under the Hadamard product and matrix scaling. These properties help to alleviate two key difficulties for reducing the complexity of the Inexact Proximal point method (IPOT), and allow us to significantly reduce the number of iterations to O(N). This yields the Fast Sinkhorn II (FS-2) algorithm for accurate computation of optimal transport with low algorithm complexity and fast convergence. Numerical experiments are presented to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In a reaction network, the concentration of a species with the property of dynamic absolute concentration robustness (dynamic ACR) converges to the same value independent of the overall initial values. This property endows a biochemical network with output robustness and therefore is essential for its functioning in a highly variable environment. It is important to identify the structure of the dynamical system as well as the constraints required for dynamic ACR. We propose a power-engine-load form of dynamic ACR and obtain results regarding convergence to the ACR value based on this form.]]></summary>

 Abstract. For reaction networks arising in systems biology, the capacity for two or more steady states, that is, multistationarity, is an important property that underlies biochemical switches. Another property receiving much attention recently is absolute concentration robustness (ACR), which means that some species concentration is the same at all positive steady states. In this work, we investigate the prevalence of each property while paying close attention to when the properties occur together. Specifically, we consider a stochastic block framework for generating random networks and prove edge-probability thresholds at which, with high probability, multistationarity appears and ACR becomes rare. We also show that the small window in which both properties occur only appears in networks with many species. Taken together, our results confirm that, in random reversible networks, ACR and multistationarity together, or even ACR on its own, is highly atypical. Our proofs rely on two prior results, one pertaining to the prevalence of networks with deficiency zero and the other “lifting” multistationarity from small networks to larger ones.]]></summary>

 Abstract.In this work, we present a novel data-driven method for identifying parametric MIMO generalized state-space or descriptor systems of low order that accurately capture the frequency and time domain behavior of large-scale linear dynamical systems. The low-order parametric descriptor systems are identified from transfer matrix samples by means of two-variable Lagrange rational matrix interpolation. This is done within the Loewner framework by deploying the new matrix-valued barycentric formula given in both right and left polynomial matrix fraction forms, which enables the construction of minimal parametric descriptor systems with rectangular transfer matrices. The developed method allows the reduction of order and parameter dependence complexity of the constructed system. Stability of the system is preserved by the postprocessing technique based on flipping signs of unstable poles. The developed methodology is illustrated with a few academic examples and applied to low-order parametric state-space identification of an aerodynamic system.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Longest common subsequence (LCS) is a classic and central problem in combinatorial optimization. While LCS admits a quadratic time solution, recent evidence suggests that solving the problem may be impossible in truly subquadratic time. A special case of LCS wherein each character appears at most once in every string is equivalent to the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem which can be solved in quasilinear time. In this work, we present novel algorithms for approximating LCS in truly subquadratic time and LIS in truly sublinear time. Our approximation factors depend on the ratio of the optimal solution size to the input size. We denote this ratio by [math] and obtain the following results for LCS and LIS without any prior knowledge of [math]: a truly subquadratic time algorithm for LCS with approximation factor [math] and a truly sublinear time algorithm for LIS with approximation factor [math]. The triangle inequality was recently used by M. Boroujeni, S. Ehsani, M. Ghodsi, M. HajiAghayi, and S. Seddingham [Proceedings of the 29th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 2018, pp. 1170–1189] and D. Chakraborty, D. Das, E. Goldenberg, M. Koucky, and M. Saks [Proceedings of the 59th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2018, pp. 979–990] to present new approximation algorithms for edit distance. Our techniques for LCS extend the notion of the triangle inequality to nonmetric settings.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We present a computational method for studying transverse homoclinic orbits for periodic solutions of delay differential equations, a phenomenon that we refer to as the Poincaré scenario. The strategy is geometric in nature and consists of viewing the connection as the zero of a nonlinear map, such that the invertibility of its Fréchet derivative implies the transversality of the intersection. The map is defined by a projected boundary value problem (BVP), with boundary conditions in the (finite dimensional) unstable and (infinite dimensional) stable manifolds of the periodic orbit. The parameterization method is used to compute the unstable manifold, and the BVP is solved using a discrete time dynamical system approach (defined via the method of steps) and Chebyshev series expansions. We illustrate this technique by computing transverse homoclinic orbits in the cubic Ikeda and Mackey–Glass systems.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Cell polarity and movement are fundamental to many biological functions. Experimental and theoretical studies have indicated that interactions of certain proteins lead to the cell polarization which plays a key role in controlling the cell movement. We study the cell polarity and movement based on a class of biophysical models that consist of reaction-diffusion equations for different proteins and the dynamics of a moving cell boundary. Such a moving boundary is often simulated by a phase-field model. We first apply the matched asymptotic analysis to give a rigorous derivation of the sharp-interface model of the cell boundary from a phase-field model. We then develop a robust numerical approach that combines the level-set method to track the sharp boundary of a moving cell and accurate discretization techniques for solving the reaction-diffusion equations on the moving cell region. Our extensive numerical simulations predict the cell polarization under various kinds of stimuli and capture both the linear and the circular trajectories of a moving cell for a long period of time. In particular, we have identified some key parameters controlling different cell trajectories that are less accurately predicted by reduced models. Our work has linked different models and also developed tools that can be adapted for the challenging three-dimensional simulations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The (unweighted) tree edit distance problem for [math] node trees asks to compute a measure of dissimilarity between two rooted trees with node labels. The current best algorithm from more than a decade ago runs in [math] time [Demaine et al., Automata, Languages and Programming, Springer, Berlin, 2007, pp. 146–157]. The same paper also showed that [math] is the best possible running time for any algorithm using the so-called decomposition strategy, which underlies almost all the known algorithms for this problem. These algorithms would also work for the weighted tree edit distance problem, which cannot be solved in truly subcubic time under the All-Pairs Shortest Paths conjecture [Bringmann et al., ACM Trans. Algorithms, 16 (2020), pp. 48:1–48:22]. In this paper, we break the cubic barrier by showing an [math] time algorithm for the unweighted tree edit distance problem. We consider an equivalent maximization problem and use a dynamic programming scheme involving matrices with many special properties. By using a decomposition scheme as well as several combinatorial techniques, we reduce tree edit distance to the max-plus product of bounded-difference matrices, which can be solved in truly subcubic time [Bringmann et al., Proceedings of the IEEE 57th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2016, pp. 375–384].]]></summary>

 Abstract. Because of the significance of remediating contaminated ecosystems, many mathematical models have been developed to describe the interactions between populations and toxicants in polluted aquatic environments. These models typically neglect the consequences of toxicant-induced behavioral changes on population dynamics. Taking into account that individuals may flee from areas with high toxicant concentrations to areas with low toxicant concentrations in order to improve their chances of survival, growth, and reproduction, we develop a diffusive population-toxicant model with toxicant-taxis. We establish the global well-posedness of our model and prove the global stability of spatially homogeneous toxicant-only steady states and population-toxicant coexistence steady states under some conditions. We find conditions under which stable spatially inhomogeneous steady states become unstable to trigger spatial pattern formations as the toxicant-taxis is strong. We also identify a narrow parameter regime in which toxicant-only and population-toxicant coexistence steady states are bistable. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate that spatial aggregation and segregation patterns between the population and the toxicant will typically emerge. Our study highlights the important effects of toxicant-induced movement responses on the spatial distributions of populations in polluted aquatic environments.]]></summary>

 Abstract. One of the most important branches of nonlinear control theory of dynamical systems is the so-called sliding mode. Its aim is the design of a (nonlinear) feedback law that brings and maintains the state trajectory of a dynamic system on a given sliding surface. Here, dynamics become completely independent of the model parameters and can be tuned accordingly to the desired target. In this paper we study this problem when the feedback law is subject to strong structural constraints. In particular, we assume that the control input may take values only over two bounded and disjoint sets. Such sets could be also not perfectly known a priori. An example is a control input allowed to switch only between two values. Under these peculiarities, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee sliding-mode control effectiveness for a class of time-varying continuous-time linear systems that includes all the stationary state-space linear models. Our analysis covers several scientific fields. It is only apparently confined to the linear setting and also allows one study an important set of nonlinear models. We describe fundamental examples related to epidemiology where the control input is the level of contact rate among people and the sliding surface permits to control the number of infected. We prove the global convergence of epidemic sliding-mode control schemes applied to two popular dynamical systems used in epidemiology, i.e., SEIR and SAIR, and based on the introduction of severe restrictions like lockdowns. Results obtained in the literature regarding control of many other epidemiological models are also generalized by casting them within a general sliding-mode theory.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The existence of HIV post-treatment controllers (PTCs) offers hope for an HIV functional cure, and understanding the critical mechanisms determining PTC represents a key step toward this goal. Here, we have studied these mechanisms by analyzing an established mathematical model for HIV viral dynamics. In mathematical models, critical mechanisms are represented by parameters that affect the tipping points to induce qualitatively different dynamics, and in cases with multiple stability, the initial conditions of the system also play a role in determining the fate of the solution. As such, for the tipping points in parameter space, we developed and implemented a sensitivity analysis of the threshold conditions of the associated bifurcations to identify the critical mechanisms for this model. Our results suggest that the infected cell death rate and the saturation parameter for cytotoxic T lymphocyte proliferation significantly affect post-treatment control. For the case with multiple stability, in state space of initial conditions, we first investigated the saddle-type equilibrium point to identify its stable manifold, which delimits trapping regions associated to the high and low viral set points. The identified stable manifold serves as a guide for the loads of immune cells and HIV virus at the time of therapy termination to achieve post-treatment control.]]></summary>
