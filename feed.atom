 Abstract. In this work we propose a model that represents the relation between fish ponds, the mosquito population and the transmission of malaria. It has been observed that in the Amazonic region of Acre, in the North of Brazil, fish farming is correlated to the transmission of malaria when carried out in artificial ponds that become breeding sites. Evidence has been found indicating that cleaning the vegetation from the edges of the crop tanks helps to control the size of the mosquito population. We use our model to determine the effective contribution of fish farming practices on malaria transmission dynamics. The model consists of a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations with jumps at the cleaning time, which act as impulsive controls. We study the asymptotic behavior of the system in function of the intensity and periodicity of the cleaning, and the value of the parameters. In particular, we state sufficient conditions under which the mosquito population is eliminated or persists, and under which the malaria is eliminated or becomes endemic. We prove our conditions by applying results for cooperative systems with concave nonlinearities.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Many biological systems can be modeled as a chemical reaction network with unknown parameters. Data available to identify these parameters are often in the form of a stationary distribution, such as that obtained from measurements of a cell population. In this work, we introduce a framework for analyzing the identifiability of the reaction rate coefficients of chemical reaction networks from stationary distribution data. Working with the linear noise approximation, which is a diffusive approximation to the chemical master equation, we give a computational procedure to certify global identifiability based on Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz. We present a variety of examples that show the applicability of our method to chemical reaction networks of interest in systems and synthetic biology, including discrimination between possible molecular mechanisms for the interaction between biochemical species.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We develop a framework to design optimal entrainment signals that entrain an ensemble of heterogeneous nonlinear oscillators, described by phase models, at desired phases. We explicitly take into account heterogeneity in both oscillation frequency and the type of oscillators characterized by different phase response curves. The central idea is to leverage the Fourier series representation of periodic functions to decode a phase-selective entrainment task into a quadratic program. We demonstrate our approach using a variety of phase models where we entrain the oscillators into distinct phase patterns. Also, we show how the generalizability gained from our formulation enables us to meet a wide range of design objectives and constraints, such as minimum-power, fast entrainment, and charge-balanced controls.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A positively invariant ball and a global attractor for the porous media lattice system are obtained. By the implicit Euler scheme, the continuous-time model is discretized as a discrete-time porous media lattice system, which generates a discrete semigroup on the positively invariant ball for sufficiently small step sizes. It is shown that the discrete semigroup has a numerical attractor, which converges upper semicontinuously to the global attractor as the step size tends to zero. A new subject on enlarged attractors for lattice systems is investigated, which includes unique existence and convergence of attractors as well as solutions on the larger initial space. The second-order Taylor expansion and discretization error on the enlarged regular space are established to prove the upper semicontinuity of the enlarged numerical attractors with respect to the step size, while an upper bound of the enlarged attractors is provided to establish the lower semicontinuity in special cases.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This work presents a mathematical theory for electromagnetic scattering resonances in a subwavelength annular hole embedded in a metallic slab, with the annulus width [math]. The model is representative among many 3D subwavelength hole structures, which are able to induce resonant scattering of electromagnetic wave and the so-called extraordinary optical transmission. We develop a multiscale framework for the underlying scattering problem based upon a combination of the integral equation in the exterior domain and the waveguide mode expansion inside the tiny hole. The matching of the electromagnetic field over the hole aperture leads to a sequence of decoupled infinite systems, which are used to set up the resonance conditions for the scattering problem. By performing rigorous analysis for the infinite systems and the resonance conditions, we characterize all the resonances in a bounded domain over the complex plane. It is shown that the resonances are associated with the transverse electric (TE) and transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waveguide modes in the annular hole, and they are close to the real axis with the imaginary parts of order [math]. We also investigate resonant scattering when an incident wave is present. It is proved that the electromagnetic field is amplified with order [math] at the resonant frequencies that are associated with the TE modes in the annular hole. On the other hand, one particular resonance associated with the TEM mode cannot be excited by a plane wave but can be excited with a near-field electric dipole source, leading to field enhancement of order [math].]]></summary>

 Abstract. The task of modeling and forecasting a dynamical system is one of the oldest problems, and it remains challenging. Broadly, this task has two subtasks: extracting the full dynamical information from a partial observation, and then explicitly learning the dynamics from this information. We present a mathematical framework in which the dynamical information is represented in the form of an embedding. The framework combines the two subtasks using the language of spaces, maps, and commutations. The framework also unifies two of the most common learning paradigms: delay-coordinates and reservoir computing. We use this framework as a platform for two other investigations of the reconstructed system, its dynamical stability and the growth of error under iterations. We show that these questions are deeply tied to more fundamental properties of the underlying system, i.e., the behavior of matrix cocycles over the base dynamics, its nonuniform hyperbolic behavior, and its decay of correlations. Thus, our framework bridges the gap between universally observed behavior of dynamics modeling and the spectral, differential, and ergodic properties intrinsic to the dynamics.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The stability analysis of synchronization in time-varying higher-order networked structures (simplicial complexes) is a challenging problem due to the presence of time-varying group interactions. In this context, most of the previous studies have been done either on temporal pairwise networks or on static simplicial complexes. Here, for the first time, we propose a general framework to study the synchronization phenomenon in temporal simplicial complexes. We show that the synchronous state exists as an invariant solution and obtain the necessary condition for it to emerge as a stable state in the fast-switching regime. We prove that the time-averaged simplicial complex plays the role of synchronization indicator whenever the switching among simplicial topologies is adequately fast. We attempt to transform the stability problem into a master stability function form. Unfortunately, for the general circumstances, the dimension reduction of the master stability equation is cumbersome due to the presence of group interactions. However, we overcome this difficulty in two interesting situations based on either the functional forms of the coupling schemes or the connectivity structure of the simplicial complex, and we demonstrate that the necessary condition mimics the form of a master stability function in these cases. We verify our analytical findings by applying them on synthetic and real-world networked systems. We find that the presence of temporality along with the multiway interactions improves the synchronization phenomena as compared to the static higher-ordered or temporal pairwise system. In addition, our results also reveal that with sufficient higher-order coupling and adequately fast rewiring, the temporal simplicial complex achieves synchrony even in a very low connectivity regime.]]></summary>

In this paper, a new class of spectral volume (SV) methods are proposed, analyzed, and implemented for diffusion equations, with the viscous flux taken as an interior penalty or direct discontinuous Galerkin formulation. The control volumes are constructed by using four kinds of special points (including Legendre–Gauss, Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto, right Legendre–Gauss–Radau and left Legendre–Gauss–Radau points) in subintervals of the underlying meshes, which leads to four different SV schemes. A framework for the stability analysis and error estimates of the four SV schemes is established. In particular, the influence of the choice of the parameters in the numerical fluxes on the convergence rate and the optimal choices of coefficients for each SV scheme are discussed and provided. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the four SV schemes for both linear and nonlinear diffusion equations.]]></summary>

In this paper, we concentrate on the robust tensor completion (RTC) problem, which aims to recover a low-rank tensor from partial observations corrupted by sparse noise. Most existing methods for RTC utilize the tensor nuclear norm (TNN) to evaluate the tensor rank. However, the TNN often yields biased solutions due to its loose approximation for the tensor rank. To solve this problem, we derive a unified non-convex surrogate that better approximates the tensor rank. Our surrogate is composed of several non-convex penalty functions. Further, we propose a generalized non-convex model, which minimizes a weighted combination of the unified non-convex surrogate and the

                    -norm data fidelity term. To solve the proposed model, we devise a simple but efficient algorithm called the proximal alternating difference of convex functions (PADCF) algorithm. Moreover, we prove the sequence generated by the PADCF algorithm converges to the critical point under some mild conditions. Numerical experiments are provided for illustrations and comparisons.]]></summary>

We present a meshfree collocation scheme to discretize intrinsic surface differential operators over scalar fields on smooth curved surfaces with given normal vectors and a non-intersecting tubular neighborhood. The method is based on discretization-corrected particle strength exchange (DC-PSE), which generalizes finite difference methods to meshfree point clouds. The proposed Surface DC-PSE method is derived from an embedding theorem, but we analytically reduce the operator kernels along surface normals to obtain a purely intrinsic computational scheme over surface point clouds. We benchmark Surface DC-PSE by discretizing the Laplace–Beltrami operator on a circle and a sphere, and we present convergence results for both explicit and implicit solvers. We then showcase the algorithm on the problem of computing Gauss and mean curvature of an ellipsoid and of the Stanford Bunny by approximating the intrinsic divergence of the normal vector field. Finally, we compare Surface DC-PSE with surface finite elements (SFEM) and diffuse-interface finite elements (DI FEM) in a validation case.]]></summary>

The multilayer model proposed in this paper is a generalization of the multilayer non-hydrostatic model for shallow granular flows (Fernández-Nieto et al in Commun Math Sci 16(5):1169–1202, 2018. https://doi.org/10.4310/cms.2018.v16.n5.a1), the multilayer model with

We show that the proposed model verifies a dissipative energy balance. A well-balanced numerical scheme is proposed to solve the equations based on a projection method and a hydrostatic reconstruction for the Coulomb friction terms. In order to reduce the computational cost associated with solving the linear system of the projection method, a precomputing of the initial guess for an iterative solver is proposed. This strategy allows us to reduce the computational time by around 70

                     when 20 layers are considered. In the numerical tests, we show that the proposed model can recover the in-depth velocity profiles typically observed in lab experiments and capture the flow/no-flow interface that appears in granular avalanches. During the initial stage of granular collapse simulations, the model is shown to improve the approximation of the mass profiles compared to other models and to predict the parabolic shape of the front velocity evolution with time, as observed in lab experiments. Interestingly, our numerical tests show that the ability of the granular flow to overcome obstacles strongly depends on the model used, which is of strong interest for landslide hazard assessment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
This paper introduces a conjugate gradients (CG) acceleration of the coordinate descent algorithm (CD) for linear systems. It is shown that the Kaczmarz algorithm (KACZ) can simulate CD exactly, so CD can be accelerated by CG similarly to the CG acceleration of KACZ (Björck and Elfving in BIT 19:145–163, 1979). Experimental results were carried out on large sets of problems of reconstructing bandlimited functions from random sampling. The randomness causes extreme variance between different instances of these problems, thus causing extreme variance in the advantage of CGCD over CD. The reduction of the number of iterations by CGCD varies from about 50–90% and beyond. The implementation of CGCD is simple. CGCD can also be used for the parallel solution of linear systems derived from partial differential equations, and for the efficient solution of multiple right-hand-side problems and matrix inversion.]]></summary>

We consider frictional contact problems in small strain elasticity discretized with finite elements and Nitsche method. Both bilateral and unilateral contact problems are taken into account, as well as both Tresca and Coulomb friction models. We derive residual a posteriori error estimates for each friction model, following (Chouly et al., in IMA J Numer Anal 38: 921–954, 2018). For the incomplete variant of Nitsche, we prove an upper bound for the dual norm of the residual, for Tresca and Coulomb friction, without any extra regularity and without a saturation assumption. We prove also local lower bounds. Numerical experiments allow to assess the accuracy of the estimates and their interest for adaptive meshing in different situations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Multisite phosphorylation is a signaling mechanism well known to give rise to multiple steady states, a property termed multistationarity. When phosphorylation occurs in a sequential and distributive manner, we obtain a family of networks indexed by the number of phosphorylation sites [math]. This work addresses the problem of understanding the parameter region where this family of networks displays multistationarity, by focusing on the projection of this region onto the set of kinetic parameters. The problem is phrased in the context of real algebraic geometry and reduced to studying whether a polynomial, defined as the determinant of a parametric matrix of size three, attains negative values over the positive orthant. The coefficients of the polynomial are functions of the kinetic parameters. For any [math], we provide sufficient conditions for the polynomial to be positive and, hence, preclude multistationarity, and also sufficient conditions for it to attain negative values and, hence, enable multistationarity. These conditions are derived by exploiting the structure of the polynomial and its Newton polytope and employing circuit polynomials. A relevant consequence of our results is that the sets of kinetic parameters that enable or preclude multistationarity are both connected for all [math].]]></summary>

 Abstract. For a mechanical system consisting of a rotator and a pendulum coupled via a small, time-periodic Hamiltonian perturbation, the Arnold diffusion problem asserts the existence of “diffusing orbits” along which the energy of the rotator grows by an amount independent of the size of the coupling parameter, for all sufficiently small values of the coupling parameter. There is a vast literature on establishing Arnold diffusion for such systems. In this work, we consider the case when an additional, dissipative perturbation is added to the rotator-pendulum system with coupling. Therefore, the system obtained is not symplectic but conformally symplectic. We provide explicit conditions on the dissipation parameter, so that the resulting system still exhibits energy growth. The fact that Arnold diffusion may play a role in systems with small dissipation was conjectured by Chirikov. In this work, the coupling is carefully chosen, but the mechanism we present can be adapted to general couplings, and we will deal with the general case in future work.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A unified method for analyzing the dynamics and topological structure associated with a class of Floquet topological insulators is presented. The method is applied to a system that describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves through the bulk of a two-dimensional lattice that is helically driven in the direction of propagation. Tight-binding approximations are employed to derive reduced dynamical systems. Further asymptotic approximations, valid in the high-frequency driving regime, yield a time-averaged system which governs the leading order behavior of the wave. From this follows an analytic calculation of the Berry connection, curvature, and Chern number via analyzing the local behavior of the eigenfunctions near the critical points of the spectrum. Examples include honeycomb, Lieb, kagome, and 1/5-depleted lattices. In the nonlinear regime, novel equations governing slowly varying wave envelopes are derived. For the honeycomb lattice, numerical simulations show that for relatively small nonlinear effects a striking spiral pattern occurs; as nonlinearity increases, localized structures emerge, and for somewhat higher nonlinearity the waves appear to collapse.]]></summary>

We design a monotone meshfree finite difference method for linear elliptic equations in the non-divergence form on point clouds via a nonlocal relaxation method. The key idea is a novel combination of a nonlocal integral relaxation of the PDE problem with a robust meshfree discretization on point clouds. Minimal positive stencils are obtained through a local 
                      
                      \(l_1\)
                      
                    -type optimization procedure that automatically guarantees the stability and, therefore, the convergence of the meshfree discretization for linear elliptic equations. A major theoretical contribution is the existence of consistent and positive stencils for a given point cloud geometry. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of positive stencils by finding neighbors within an ellipse (2d) or ellipsoid (3d) surrounding each interior point, generalizing the study for Poisson’s equation by Seibold (Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 198(3–4):592–601, 2008). It is well-known that wide stencils are in general needed for constructing consistent and monotone finite difference schemes for linear elliptic equations. Our result represents a significant improvement in the stencil width estimate for positive-type finite difference methods for linear elliptic equations in the near-degenerate regime (when the ellipticity constant becomes small), compared to previously known works in this area. Numerical algorithms and practical guidance are provided with an eye on the case of small ellipticity constant. At the end, we present numerical results for the performance of our method in both 2d and 3d, examining a range of ellipticity constants including the near-degenerate regime.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study traveling wave solutions to bistable differential equations on infinite k-ary trees. These graphs generalize the notion of classical square infinite lattices and our results complement those for bistable lattice equations on [math]. Using comparison principles and explicit lower and upper solutions, we show that wave solutions are pinned for small diffusion parameters. Upon increasing the diffusion, the wave starts to travel with nonzero speed, in a direction that depends on the detuning parameter. However, once the diffusion is sufficiently strong, the wave propagates in a single direction up the tree irrespective of the detuning parameter. In particular, our results imply that changes to the diffusion parameter can lead to a reversal of the propagation direction.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Classical gene expression models assume exponential switching time distributions between the active and inactive promoter states. However, recent experiments have shown that many genes in mammalian cells may produce nonexponential switching time distributions, implying the existence of multiple promoter states and molecular memory in the promoter switching dynamics. Here we analytically solve a gene expression model with random bursting and complex promoter switching, and derive the time-dependent distributions of the mRNA and protein copy numbers, generalizing the steady-state solution obtained in [T. Zhou and J. Zhang, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 72 (2012), pp. 789–818] and [U. Herbach, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 79 (2019), pp. 1007–1029]. Using multiscale simplification techniques, we find that molecular memory has no influence on the time-dependent distribution when promoter switching is very fast or very slow, while it significantly affects the distribution when promoter switching is neither too fast nor too slow. By analyzing the dynamical phase diagram of the system, we also find that molecular memory in the inactive gene state weakens transient and stationary bimodality of the copy number distribution, while molecular memory in the active gene state enhances such bimodality.]]></summary>

 Abstract. When ions are crowded, the effect of steric repulsion between ions (which can produce oscillations in charge density profiles) becomes significant and the conventional Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) equation should be modified. Several modified PB equations were developed but the associated total ionic charge density has no oscillation. This motivates us to derive a general model of PB equations called the PB-steric equations with a parameter [math], which not only include the conventional and modified PB equations but also have oscillatory total ionic charge density under different assumptions of steric effects and chemical potentials. As [math], the PB-steric equation becomes the conventional PB equation, but as [math], the concentrations of ions and solvent molecules are determined by the Lambert type functions. To approach the modified PB equations, we study the asymptotic limit of PB-steric equations with the Robin boundary condition as [math] goes to infinity. Our theoretical results show that the PB-steric equations (for [math]) may include the conventional and modified PB equations. On the other hand, we use the PB-steric equations to find oscillatory total ionic charge density which cannot be obtained in the conventional and modified PB equations.]]></summary>

This work focuses on the robust and high-order numerical simulations of weakly compressible two-phase flows by using the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method combined with an explicit strong-stability-preserving Runge–Kutta scheme. In order to improve the computational robustness under large density ratios, a nonlinear weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) limiter and a positivity-preserving limiter are specially designed and applied with the aim of dampening the nonphysical oscillations around the phase interface and preventing the occurrence of negative density, respectively. More importantly, we theoretically prove that the present method is able to satisfy the uniform-pressure–velocity criterion which states that uniform pressure and velocity profiles around an isolated phase interface should be preserved during the simulation. The performance of the present method is validated by a range of benchmark test cases with density ratios up to 1000:1. The results demonstrate that the present method possesses a good capability of simulating weakly compressible two-phase flows with large density ratios.]]></summary>

In this paper, a hybrid Hermite weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme is proposed for nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations which may contain discontinuity in the solution. The present scheme is constructed by applying the hybrid HWENO method based on the zero- and first-order moment with DDG flux to discrete the diffusion term in spatial direction and the third-order TVD Runge–Kutta method in temporal direction. A troubled-cell indicator is first used to identify the cells in which the discontinuity may exist, then the first-order moment in the troubled-cell is reconstructed by fifth-order HWENO scheme. To avoid spurious oscillation, the HWENO reconstruction is performed when the reconstruction stencils contain troubled-cell, otherwise linear reconstruction is performed straightforwardly. Compared with WENO schemes, the present scheme has advantages: (1) compactness, only immediate neighbor cells are used in the reconstruction procedure; (2) accuracy, the numerical errors by the present scheme are smaller than those by WENO schemes. Some benchmarks for one- and two-dimensional parabolic equations to demonstrate the high order accuracy and non-oscillatory performance of the present scheme.]]></summary>

This paper introduces a new sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm that jointly recovers a temporal sequence of edge maps from noisy and under-sampled Fourier data. The new method is cast in a Bayesian framework and uses a prior that simultaneously incorporates intra-image information to promote sparsity in each individual edge map with inter-image information to promote similarities in any unchanged regions. By treating both the edges as well as the similarity between adjacent images as random variables, there is no need to separately form regions of change. Thus we avoid both additional computational cost as well as any information loss resulting from pre-processing the image. Our numerical examples demonstrate that our new method compares favorably with more standard SBL approaches.]]></summary>

We propose and study a method for finding quasi-resonances for a linear acoustic transmission problem in frequency domain.

We develop error estimates for the impact of Galerkin discretization on singular values and devise a heuristic adaptive algorithm for finding the minima in prescribed k-intervals. Our method exclusively relies on the solution of eigenvalue problems for real k, in contrast to alternative approaches that rely on extension to the complex plane.]]></summary>

At each time step, all variables can be computed independently by solving a sequence of linear finite element schemes and algebraic equations. The solvability and unconditionally energy stability of the two schemes are rigorously demonstrated. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness and stability of the proposed schemes.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The overexploitation of natural resources by our industrial society questions its long-term sustainability. Recently, a simple nature-society interrelation model, called the HANDY (Human And Nature DYnamics) model, has been proposed by Motesharrei, Rivas, and Kalnay [Ecol. Econ., 101 (2014), pp. 90–102] to address this concern with a special emphasis on the role of the stratification of the society. In this paper we analyze the dynamics of this model, and we explore the influence of two parameters: the nature depletion rate and the inequality factor. We characterize the asymptotic states of the system through a bifurcation analysis, and we derive several quantitative predictions. We show that some collapses are irreversible and, depending on the wealth production factor, bistability regimes can be obtained. In particular, a sustainable equilibrium can coexist with cycles of prosperity and collapse. We discuss the possible policies to prevent undesirable fates.]]></summary>

 Abstract. As a model to provide a hands-on, elementary understanding of chaotic dynamics in dimension 3, we introduce a [math]-open set of diffeomorphisms of [math] having two horseshoes with different dimensions of instability. We prove that the unstable set of one horseshoe and the stable set of the other are of Hausdorff dimension nearly 2 whose cross sections are Cantor sets and that the intersection of the unstable and stable sets contains a fractal set of Hausdorff dimension nearly 1. As a corollary we detect [math]-robust heterodimensional cycles. Our proof employs the theory of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds and the thicknesses of Cantor sets.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This work is concerned with the Dirac points for the honeycomb lattice with impenetrable obstacles arranged periodically in a homogeneous medium. We consider both the Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalue problems and prove the existence of Dirac points for both eigenvalue problems at crossing of the lower band surfaces as well as higher band surfaces. Furthermore, we perform quantitative analyses for the eigenvalues and the slopes of two conical dispersion surfaces near each Dirac point based on a combination of the layer potential technique and asymptotic analysis. It is shown that the eigenvalues are in the neighborhood of the singular frequencies associated with the Green’s function for the honeycomb lattice, and the slopes of the dispersion surfaces are reciprocal to the eigenvalues.]]></summary>

In this paper, a new limiter namely the compact weighted biased average procedure (CWBAP) is proposed for the shock capturing of high-order finite volume methods on unstructured girds. The new feature of this limiter is that all its operations are based on the information within a compact stencil. This limiter is an improvement of the original weighted biased average procedure (WBAP) which is not compact due to its successive limiting feature when applied to high-order schemes. This improvement mainly relies on two new techniques: a successive secondary reconstruction and a two-step WBAP limiter. The new limiter can preserve the original order of accuracy of the high-order finite volume schemes when simulating smooth flow without shock waves, and it shows improvements in accuracy, resolution and convergence property over the original WBAP limiter according to the numerical results of a number of test cases. Furthermore, the compactness of this limiter reduces the amount of data transfer in parallel computing. When implemented into the newly developed high-order finite volume schemes based on the compact stencil, the efficiency of the parallel computing can be effectively improved.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The influence of multiplicative stochastic perturbations on the class of asymptotically Hamiltonian systems on the plane is investigated. It is assumed that disturbances do not preserve the equilibrium of the corresponding limiting system, and their intensity decays in time with power-law asymptotics. The paper discusses the long-term asymptotic behavior of solutions and its dependence on the structure and parameters of perturbations. In particular, it is shown that perturbed trajectories can tend to the equilibrium of the limiting system or that new stochastically stable states can arise. The proposed analysis is based on a combination of the averaging method and the construction of stochastic Lyapunov functions. The results obtained are applied to the problem of capture into parametric autoresonance in the presence of noise.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Biological systems are known to be inherently uncertain and complex, and it is often difficult to justify rigorously functional forms used in a mathematical model. Generally, one chooses some simple function having qualitatively correct behavior without concern for the precise choice of function; the assumption has been that qualitatively similar functions will produce qualitatively similar behavior from the model. However, it has been shown that, in some cases, the qualitative predictions from a model are sensitive to the particular functional form used; this property is known as structural sensitivity. A promising tool for quantification of structural sensitivity is the use of partially specified models, in which some number of functions in equations are not defined explicitly. However, in this approach we cannot rely on the traditional parameter-based framework, where all functional forms are well defined but contain parameters to be determined. The main difficulties are that, mathematically, we need to deal with an infinite-dimensional function space and that a well-defined measure on that space is needed. We propose a novel framework to reveal the structural sensitivity and quantify uncertainty in partially specified biological models based on ordinary differential equations backed up by empirical data. Our method uses path integration, previously introduced in theoretical physics. As an insightful example, we explore structural sensitivity of a well-known tritrophic food chain model in which the functional response of the predator is uncertain, using available experimental data on protozoan predation on bacteria. For the mentioned model, we compare the novel framework with the classical methods of parameter-based sensitivity analysis and demonstrate distinct outcomes for the two approaches. Finally, we discuss a further extension of the proposed framework.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a matroid constraint and present a deterministic algorithm that achieves [math]-approximation for the problem (for some [math]). This algorithm is the first deterministic algorithm known to improve over the [math]-approximation ratio of the classical greedy algorithm proved by Nemhauser, Wolsey, and Fisher in 1978.]]></summary>

We propose and analyze a first-order in time, second order in space finite difference scheme for the functionalized Cahn-Hilliard (FCH) equation with a logarithmic Flory-Huggins potential. The semi-implicit numerical scheme is designed based on a suitable convex-concave decomposition of the FCH free energy. We prove unique solvability of the numerical algorithm and verify its unconditional energy stability without any restriction on the time step size.

Restoring natural images corrupted by Cauchy noise is a challenging issue in image processing. In the existing methods, the traditional model-driven and filter-based methods can not recover the images well, and the learning-based plug-and-play method lacks convergence guarantees. In this paper, we propose a convergent plug-and-play method with outliers detection (C-PnPO) to remove Cauchy noise. The outlier detection is based on an outlier map regularized by maximum entropy. Due to the statistical properties of Cauchy distribution and the implicit deep image priors, the problem is non-convex and implicit. We present a convergent algorithm to address these issues by an adaptively relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers. Theoretically, we give some useful mathematical properties, including the existence of solutions under mild assumptions, and the global linear convergence of the proposed method by an adaptive relaxation strategy. Experimental results show that the outliers can be successfully detected, and the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-art traditional and learning-based methods both in terms of quantitative and qualitative comparisons.]]></summary>
