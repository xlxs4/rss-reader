 Abstract. In this work, we propose and study a preconditioned framework with a graphic Ginzburg–Landau functional for image segmentation and data clustering by parallel computing. Solving nonlocal models is usually challenging due to the huge computation burden. For the nonconvex and nonlocal variational functional, we propose several damped Jacobi and generalized Richardson preconditioners for the large-scale linear systems within a difference of convex functions algorithm framework. These preconditioners are efficient for parallel computing with GPU and can leverage the computational cost. Our framework also provides flexible step sizes with a global convergence guarantee. Numerical experiments show the proposed algorithms are very competitive compared to the singular value decomposition based spectral method.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We prove that the Kuramoto model on a graph can contain infinitely many nonequivalent stable equilibria. More precisely, we prove that for every [math] there is a connected graph such that the set of stable equilibria contains a manifold of dimension [math]. In particular, we solve a conjecture of Delabays, Coletta, and Jacquod about the number of equilibria on planar graphs. Our results are based on the analysis of balanced configurations, which correspond to equilateral polygon linkages in topology. In order to analyze the stability of manifolds of equilibria we apply topological bifurcation theory.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Inspired by applications, we study the effect of interface slip on the effective wave propagation in poroelastic materials, which are composites consisting of elastic frames whose pore space is filled with fluid. The current literature on the homogenization for the poroelastic wave equations are all based on the no-slip interface condition posed on the microscale. However, for certain pore fluids, the no-slip condition is known to be physically invalid. In the literature, slip boundary conditions have been considered for porous materials with rigid solid frames. For these rigid porous materials, the wave can only propagate in the pore fluid and hence the equations for the microscale are posed only in the pore space. Consequently, the slip on the interface involves only the fluid velocity and the fluid stress. In contrast, for poroelastic materials, the wave can propagate not only in the pore fluid but also in the solid frame; hence the slip conditions involve the velocities on both sides of the interface, rather than just the fluid side. With this slip condition, a variational boundary value problem governing the small vibrations of a periodic mixture of an elastic solid and a slightly viscous fluid is studied in this paper. The method of two-scale convergence is used to obtain the macroscopic behavior of the solution and to identify the role played by the slip interface condition.]]></summary>

In this paper, the convex-splitting BDF2 method with variable time-steps (proposed in Chen et al. SIAM J Numer Anal 57:495–525, 2019) is reconsidered for the Cahn–Hilliard model. We adopt the Fourier pseudo-spectral discretization in space. With the help of the discrete gradient structure of the BDF2 formula and some embedded inequalities, we prove that the scheme preserves a modified energy dissipation law under the updated time-step-ratio restriction 
                      
                      \(0<r_{k}=\tau _{k}/\tau _{k-1}<4.864\)
                      
                    . By utilizing the discrete orthogonal convolution kernels, some discrete convolution inequalities and some proof techniques (Lemma 4.6), we tackle the difficulty brought from the Douglas-Dupont regularization stabilized term and prove the robust

 Abstract. Mathematical models come in many forms across biological applications. In the case of complex, spatial dynamics and pattern formation, stochastic models also face two main challenges: pattern data are largely qualitative, and model realizations may vary significantly. Together these issues make it difficult to relate models and empirical data—or even models and models—limiting how different approaches can be combined to offer new insights into biology. These challenges also raise mathematical questions about how models are related, since alternative approaches to the same problem—e.g., Cellular Potts models; off-lattice, agent-based models; on-lattice, cellular automaton models; and continuum approaches—treat uncertainty and implement cell behavior in different ways. To help open the door to future work on questions like these, here we adapt methods from topological data analysis and computational geometry to quantitatively relate two different models of the same biological process in a fair, comparable way. To center our work and illustrate concrete challenges, we focus on the example of zebrafish-skin pattern formation, and we relate patterns that arise from agent-based and cellular automaton models.]]></summary>

 Abstract. How morphogenesis depends on cell properties is an active direction of research. Here, we focus on mechanical models of growing plant tissues, where microscopic (sub)cellular structure is taken into account. In order to establish links between microscopic and macroscopic tissue properties, we perform a multiscale analysis of a model of growing plant tissue with subcellular resolution. We use homogenization to rigorously derive the corresponding macroscopic tissue-scale model. Tissue-scale mechanical properties are computed from microscopic structural and material properties, taking into account deformation by the growth field. We then consider case studies and numerically compare the detailed microscopic model and the tissue-scale model, both implemented using the finite element method. We find that the macroscopic model can be used to efficiently make predictions about several configurations of interest. Our work will help making links between microscopic measurements and macroscopic observations in growing tissues.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In the Bin Packing problem one is given [math] items with weights [math] and [math] bins with capacities [math]. The goal is to partition the items into sets [math] such that [math] for every bin [math], where [math] denotes [math]. Björklund, Husfeldt, and Koivisto [SIAM J. Comput., 39 (2009), pp. 546–563] presented an [math] time algorithm for Bin Packing (the [math] notation omits factors polynomial in the input size). In this paper, we show that for every [math] there exists a constant [math] such that an instance of Bin Packing with [math] bins can be solved in [math] randomized time. Before our work, such improved algorithms were not known even for [math]. A key step in our approach is the following new result in Littlewood–Offord theory on the additive combinatorics of subset sums: For every [math] there exists an [math] such that if [math] for some [math], then [math].]]></summary>

 Abstract. In an epidemic network, lags due to travel time between populations, latent period, and recovery period can significantly change the epidemic behavior and result in successive echoing waves of the spread between various population clusters. Moreover, external shocks to a given population can propagate to other populations within the network, potentially snowballing into waves of resurgent epidemics. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of time delay and small shocks/uncertainties on the linear susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) dynamics of epidemic networks. In this regard, the asymptotic stability of this class of networks is first studied, and then its …]]></summary>

 Abstract.The deep linear network (DLN) is a model for implicit regularization in gradient based optimization of overparametrized learning architectures. Training the DLN corresponds to a Riemannian gradient flow, where the Riemannian metric is defined by the architecture of the network and the loss function is defined by the learning task. We extend this geometric framework, obtaining explicit expressions for the volume form, including the case when the network has infinite depth. We investigate the link between the Riemannian geometry and the training asymptotics for matrix completion with rigorous analysis and numerics. We propose that under small initialization, implicit regularization is a result of bias towards high state space volume.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Social interactions often occur between three or more agents simultaneously. Examining opinion dynamics on hypergraphs allows one to study the effect of such polyadic interactions on the opinions of agents. In this paper, we consider a bounded-confidence model (BCM), in which opinions take continuous values and interacting agents comprise their opinions if they are close enough to each other. We study a density description of a Deffuant–Weisbuch BCM on hypergraphs. We derive a rate equation for the mean-field opinion density as the number of agents becomes infinite, and we prove that this rate equation yields a probability density that converges to noninteracting opinion clusters. Using numerical simulations, we examine bifurcations of the density-based BCM’s steady-state opinion clusters and demonstrate that the agent-based BCM converges to the density description of the BCM as the number of agents becomes infinite.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Many networked systems are governed by non-pairwise interactions between nodes. The resulting higher-order interaction structure can then be encoded by means of a hypernetwork. In this paper we consider dynamical systems on hypernetworks by defining a class of admissible maps for every such hypernetwork. We explain how to classify robust cluster synchronization patterns on hypernetworks by finding balanced partitions, and we generalize the concept of a graph fibration to the hypernetwork context. We also show that robust synchronization patterns are only fully determined by polynomial admissible maps of high order. This means that, unlike in dyadic networks, cluster synchronization on hypernetworks is a higher-order, i.e., nonlinear, effect. We give a formula, in terms of the order of the hypernetwork, for the degree of the polynomial admissible maps that determine robust synchronization patterns. We also demonstrate that this degree is optimal by investigating a class of examples. We conclude by demonstrating how this effect may cause remarkable synchrony breaking bifurcations that occur at high polynomial degree.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The constructive theory of analytical higher-order contrast bounds for the effective constants of dispersed conducting and piezoelectric fibrous composites is developed. The lower-order bounds, e.g., Wiener and Hashin–Shtrikman bounds, are universal for composites but do not take into account interactions among inclusions corresponding to their location. To study the variety of dispersed random composites, we use computationally effective structural sums directly relating the location of inclusions to the effective constants. The present paper is the first report where the structural sums are applied to higher-order contrast bounds instead of the virtually impossible in computation multipoint correlation functions. We concentrate our attention on two-phase conducting fibrous composites. Rylko’s matrix decomposition is used for the higher-order contrast bounds to extend the obtained analytical bounds to piezoelectric fibrous composites. The supplementary materials contain the results of numerical-symbolic computations, the long analytical formulas for the effective constants and bounds up to [math], where [math] stands for concentration.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study order reconstruction (OR) solutions in the Beris–Edwards framework for nematodynamics, for both passive and active nematic flows in a microfluidic channel. OR solutions exhibit polydomains and domain walls, and as such, are of physical interest. We show that OR solutions exist for passive flows with constant velocity and pressure, but only for specific boundary conditions. We prove the existence of unique, symmetric, and nonsingular nematic profiles for boundary conditions that do not allow for OR solutions. We compute asymptotic expansions for OR-type solutions for passive flows with nonconstant velocity and pressure, and active flows, which shed light on the internal structure of domain walls. The asymptotics are complemented by numerical studies that demonstrate the universality of OR-type structures in static and dynamic scenarios.]]></summary>

The fully-connected tensor network (FCTN) decomposition is an emerging method for processing and analyzing higher-order tensors. For an Nth-order tensor, the standard deterministic algorithms, such as alternating least squares (FCTN-ALS) algorithm, need to store large coefficient matrices formed by contracting 
                      
                      \(N-1\)
                      
                     FCTN factor tensors. The memory cost of coefficient matrices grows exponentially with the size of the original tensor, which makes the algorithms memory-prohibitive for handling large-scale tensors. To enable FCTN decomposition to handle large-scale tensors effectively, we propose a stochastic gradient descent (FCTN-SGD) algorithm without sacrificing accuracy. The memory cost of FCTN-SGD algorithm grows linearly with the size of the original tensor and is significantly lower than that of the FCTN-ALS algorithm. The success of the FCTN-SGD algorithm lies in the suggested factor sampling operator, which cleverly avoids storing large coefficient matrices in the algorithm. By using the suggested operator, sampling on small factor tensors is equal to sampling on large coefficient matrices with a theoretical guarantee. Furthermore, we present an FCTN-VRSGD algorithm by introducing variance reduction into the FCTN-SGD algorithm, and theoretically prove the convergence of the FCTN-VRSGD algorithm under a mild assumption. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed FCTN-SGD and FCTN-VRSGD algorithms, especially for real-world large-scale tensors.]]></summary>

We construct a high-order (cubic) Hermite finite volume method (FVM-2L) with a two-layered dual strategy on triangular meshes, which possesses the conservation laws in both flux form and equation form.

Wearables, equipped with various sensing technologies (e.g., accelerometer for movement, optics for heart rate), are increasingly being recognised for their expansive potential in (remote) patient monitoring, diagnostics, and therapeutic applications which suggests a plausible move towards a more decentralised healthcare system. This shift is evident as healthcare providers and patients alike are becoming increasingly accepting of wearable-driven tools, as they enable continuous health monitoring outside of traditional clinical settings. Equally, the ubiquitous nature of smartphones, now more than mere communication tools, is being harnessed to serve as pivotal health monitoring instruments. Their added sensing capabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) driven connectivity enable a (relatively) seamless transition from conventional health practices to a more interconnected, digital age. However, this evolving landscape is not without its challenges, with concerns surrounding data privacy, security, and ensuring equitable access to digital advances. As we delve deeper into digital healthcare, we must harness the full potential of those technologies and ensure their ethical and equitable implementation, envisioning a future where healthcare is not just hospital-centric but is part of our daily lives.]]></summary>

Inverse obstacle scattering is the recovery of an obstacle boundary from the scattering data produced by incident waves. This shape recovery can be done by iteratively solving a PDE-constrained optimization problem for the obstacle boundary. While it is well known that this problem is typically non-convex and ill-posed, previous investigations have shown that in many settings these issues can be alleviated by using a continuation-in-frequency method and introducing a regularization that limits the frequency content of the obstacle boundary. It has been recently observed that these techniques can fail for obstacles with pronounced cavities, even in the case of penetrable obstacles where similar optimization and regularization methods work for the equivalent problem of recovering a piecewise constant wave speed. The present work investigates the recovery of obstacle boundaries for impenetrable, sound-soft media with pronounced cavities, given multi-frequency scattering data. Numerical examples demonstrate that the problem is sensitive to the choice of iterative solver used at each frequency and the initial guess at the lowest frequency. We propose a modified continuation-in-frequency method which follows a random walk in frequency, as opposed to the standard monotonically increasing path. This method shows some increased robustness in recovering cavities, but can also fail for more extreme examples. An interesting phenomenon is observed that while the obstacle reconstructions obtained over several random trials can vary significantly near the cavity, the results are consistent for non-cavity parts of the boundary.]]></summary>

It has long been known that second order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equations with nonoscillatory coefficients admit nonoscillatory phase functions. This observation is the basis of many techniques for the asymptotic approximation of the solutions of such equations, as well as several schemes for their numerical solution. However, it was only relatively recently exploited to develop the first high-accuracy numerical solver for second order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equations which runs in time independent of frequency. Here, we introduce the first high-accuracy, frequency-independent method for the numerical solution of second order linear inhomogeneous ordinary differential equations. Our algorithm operates by constructing a nonoscillatory phase function representing the solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equation. Then, it uses an adaptive Levin scheme to construct a collection of auxiliary nonoscillatory functions that efficiently represent a highly oscillatory indefinite integral giving a particular solution of the inhomogeneous differential equation. Once the phase function and these auxiliary functions have been constructed, the inhomogeneous equation can be solved subject to essentially any reasonable boundary conditions. The results of numerical experiments illustrating the properties of our scheme are discussed.]]></summary>

We investigate the use of models from the theory of regularity structures as features in machine learning tasks. A model is a polynomial function of a space–time signal designed to well-approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), even in low regularity regimes. Models can be seen as natural multi-dimensional generalisations of signatures of paths; our work therefore aims to extend the recent use of signatures in data science beyond the context of time-ordered data. We provide a flexible definition of a model feature vector associated to a space–time signal, along with two algorithms which illustrate ways in which these features can be combined with linear regression. We apply these algorithms in several numerical experiments designed to learn solutions to PDEs with a given forcing and boundary data. Our experiments include semi-linear parabolic and wave equations with forcing, and Burgers’ equation with no forcing. We find an advantage in favour of our algorithms when compared to several alternative methods. Additionally, in the experiment with Burgers’ equation, we find non-trivial predictive power when noise is added to the observations.]]></summary>

This paper analyses the long-time behaviour of one-stage symplectic or symmetric trigonometric integrators when applied to nonlinear wave equations. It is shown that energy, momentum, and all harmonic actions are approximately preserved over a long time for one-stage explicit symplectic or symmetric trigonometric integrators when applied to nonlinear wave equations via spectral semi-discretisations. For the long-term analysis of symplectic or symmetric trigonometric integrators, we derive a multi-frequency modulated Fourier expansion of the trigonometric integrator and show three almost-invariants of the modulation system. In the analysis of this paper, we neither assume symmetry for symplectic methods, nor assume symplecticity for symmetric methods. The results for symplectic and symmetric methods are obtained as a byproduct of the above analysis. We also give another proof by establishing a relationship between symplectic and symmetric trigonometric integrators and trigonometric integrators which have been researched for wave equations in the literature.]]></summary>

Preconditioning techniques have been focused on multi-linear systems or tensor equations. However, to our knowledge, there is no relevant research on tensor complementarity problems. In this paper, we present a general preconditioner P for solving the tensor complementarity problem (TCP) involved with an 
                      
                      \({\mathcal {L}}\)

                     and a vector q, and we prove that the TCP
                      
                      \(({\mathcal {A}},q)\)
                      
                     is equivalent to the TCP
                      
                      \((P{\mathcal {A}},Pq)\)

For actual computations, we provide a concrete choice for the preconditioner P associated with a parameter satisfying above-mentioned hypothesis. In addition, it is proved theoretically that the convergence rate of the fixed point method with the chosen preconditioner P is at least as fast as that of the corresponding method without preprocessing. Meanwhile, we also obtain the monotony of the parameter on the performance of the preconditioned iterative method. Lastly, numerical examples are used to demonstrate the theoretical results.]]></summary>

Wasserstein–Fisher–Rao (WFR) distance is a family of metrics to gauge the discrepancy of two Radon measures, which takes into account both transportation and weight change. Spherical WFR distance is a projected version of WFR distance for probability measures so that the space of Radon measures equipped with WFR can be viewed as metric cone over the space of probability measures with spherical WFR. Compared to the case for Wasserstein distance, the understanding of geodesics under the spherical WFR is less clear and still an ongoing research focus. In this paper, we develop a deep learning framework to compute the geodesics under the spherical WFR metric, and the learned geodesics can be adopted to generate weighted samples. Our approach is based on a Benamou–Brenier type dynamic formulation for spherical WFR. To overcome the difficulty in enforcing the boundary constraint brought by the weight change, a Kullback–Leibler divergence term based on the inverse map is introduced into the cost function. Moreover, a new regularization term using the particle velocity is introduced as a substitute for the Hamilton–Jacobi equation for the potential in dynamic formula. When used for sample generation, our framework can be beneficial for applications with given weighted samples, especially in the Bayesian inference, compared to sample generation with previous flow models.]]></summary>

A novel domain decomposition method is proposed in this paper to solve eigenvalue problems. Both the simple and multiple eigenvalues are considered in algorithm design and theoretical analysis. The key thought is to transform the eigenvalue problem into a number of linear boundary value problems in a multilevel space sequence and some small-scale eigenvalue problems in a low-dimensional correction space. Then some well-developed domain decomposition methods for linear boundary value problem can be directly used to resolve eigenvalue problems. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we can find the presented novel domain decomposition algorithm for eigenvalue problems can derive the same solving efficiency and parallel scalability as that for linear boundary value problems.]]></summary>

In this paper, we are concerned with a class of structured optimization problems frequently arising from image processing and statistical learning, where the objective function is the sum of a quadratic term and a nonsmooth part, and the constraint set consists of a linear equality constraint and two simple convex sets in the sense that projections onto simple sets are easy to compute. To fully exploit the quadratic and separable structure of the problem under consideration, we accordingly propose a partially inertial Douglas–Rachford splitting method. It is noteworthy that our algorithm enjoys easy subproblems for the case where the underlying two simple convex sets are not the whole spaces. Theoretically, we establish the global convergence of the proposed algorithm under some mild conditions. A series of computational results on the constrained Lasso and constrained total-variation (TV) based image restoration demonstrate that our proposed method is competitive with some state-of-the-art first-order solvers.]]></summary>

Thresholding-based methods are widely used for sparse optimization problems in many applications including compressive sensing, image processing, and machine learning. However, the hard thresholding method may converge slowly or diverge for many practical problems. In this paper, we propose a scaled proximal gradient method for solving sparse optimization problems, where the scaled matrix can take a varying positive diagonal for connecting the residual reduction. The global convergence of the proposed method is established under some mild assumptions without the restricted isometry property condition. We also present a scaled proximal pursuit and a modified scaled proximal gradient method with global convergence under the restricted isometry property. Finally, some numerical tests are reported to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methods over the classical thresholding-based methods.]]></summary>

In this paper, we explore the special structure of kernel matrices by defining and utilizing the properties of the Lower-ColLinear Triangular Matrix (L-CoLT matrix) and Upper-ColLinear Triangular Matrix (U-CoLT matrix). We prove that (1) L/U-CoLT matrix–vector multiplications can be carried out in O(N) operations; (2) both families of matrices are closed under the Hadamard product and matrix scaling. These properties help to alleviate two key difficulties for reducing the complexity of the Inexact Proximal point method (IPOT), and allow us to significantly reduce the number of iterations to O(N). This yields the Fast Sinkhorn II (FS-2) algorithm for accurate computation of optimal transport with low algorithm complexity and fast convergence. Numerical experiments are presented to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.]]></summary>
