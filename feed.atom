 Abstract. Coarse-scale surrogate models in the context of numerical homogenization of linear elliptic problems with arbitrary rough diffusion coefficients rely on the efficient solution of fine-scale subproblems on local subdomains whose solutions are then employed to deduce appropriate coarse contributions to the surrogate model. However, in the absence of periodicity and scale separation, the reliability of such models requires the local subdomains to cover the whole domain which may result in high offline costs, in particular for parameter-dependent and stochastic problems. This paper justifies the use of neural networks for the approximation of coarse-scale surrogate models by analyzing their approximation properties. For a prototypical and representative numerical homogenization technique, the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition method, we show that one single neural network is sufficient to approximate the coarse contributions of all occurring coefficient-dependent local subproblems for a nontrivial class of diffusion coefficients up to arbitrary accuracy. We present rigorous upper bounds on the depth and number of nonzero parameters for such a network to achieve a given accuracy. Further, we analyze the overall error of the resulting neural network enhanced numerical homogenization surrogate model.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the quantitative homogenization of linear second order elliptic equations in nondivergence form with highly oscillating periodic diffusion coefficients and with large drifts, in the so-called centered setting where homogenization occurs and the large drifts contribute to the effective diffusivity. Using the centering condition and the invariant measures associated with the underlying diffusion process, we transform the equation into divergence form with modified diffusion coefficients but without drift. The latter is in the standard setting for which quantitative homogenization results have been developed systematically. An application of those results then yields quantitative estimates, such as the convergence rates and uniform Lipschitz regularity, for equations in nondivergence form with large drifts.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we consider an inverse interaction scattering problem of recovering an interface between the fluid and piezoelectric solid from acoustic measurements. First, the well-posedness of the interaction model is shown in associated function spaces by the variational method. Then new uniqueness results are proved for the inverse problem by taking far-field data at one fixed frequency, based on a uniform a priori estimate of the solutions of the interaction model. With these results, the factorization method is then justified to reconstruct the shape and location of the interface between the fluid and piezoelectric solid. Finally, we investigate an associated interior transmission eigenvalue problem, and show that the set of interior transmission eigenvalues is at most discrete and with no finite accumulation point under a natural assumption on physical coefficients.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We prove an optimal mixing time bound for the single-site update Markov chain known as the Glauber dynamics or Gibbs sampling in a variety of settings. Our work presents an improved version of the spectral independence approach of Anari, Liu, and Oveis Gharan [Proceedings of the 61st Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2020, pp. 1319–1330] and shows [math] mixing time on any [math]-vertex graph of bounded degree when the maximum eigenvalue of an associated influence matrix is bounded. As an application of our results, for the hardcore model on independent sets weighted by a fugacity [math], we establish [math] mixing time for the Glauber dynamics on any [math]-vertex graph of constant maximum degree [math] …]]></summary>

 Abstract. We exhibit an unambiguous [math]-DNF (disjunctive normal form) formula that requires conjunctive normal form width [math], which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. As a consequence, we get a near-optimal solution to the Alon–Saks–Seymour problem in graph theory (posed in 1991), which asks, How large a gap can there be between the chromatic number of a graph and its biclique partition number? Our result is also known to imply several other improved separations in query/communication complexity, learning theory, and automata theory.]]></summary>

In this paper, we investigate inverse obstacle scattering problems in acoustic waveguides with low-frequency data. A Bayesian inference scheme, combining a multi-fidelity strategy and surrogate model with guided modes and a deep neural network is proposed to reconstruct the shapes of unknown scattering objects. First, the inverse problem is reformulated as a statistical inference problem using Bayes’ formula, which provides statistical characteristics of the posterior distribution and quantification of the uncertainties. The well-posedness of the posterior distribution is proved by using the f-divergence. Subsequently, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is used to explore the posterior density. We propose a new multi-fidelity surrogate model to accelerate the sampling procedure while maintaining high accuracy. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that this method not only produces high-quality reconstructions but also substantially reduces computational costs.]]></summary>

In this paper, we propose a nonconvex and nonsmooth image prior based on the hyperbolic tangent function and apply it as a regularization term for image restoration and reconstruction problems. Theoretically, we analyze the properties of the function and the minimizers of its associated proximal problem. Since the proximal problem has no closed-form solution, we propose a derivative-free Nelder-Mead simplex based selection algorithm to find the global minimizer. To reduce the computational cost, we only solve a small 1D problem and then use the 1D solution template as a look-up table to interpolate high-dimension data. Moreover, we consider a variational model based on the proposed image prior. Then we use the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm on the nonconvex model to derive efficient numerical algorithms. Various experiments on image denoising, image deblurring, and image reconstruction demonstrate that the proposed nonconvex prior is competitive with the existing priors. In particular, it outperforms others in recovering piecewise constant images.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper considers resource-driven pattern formation in consumer-resource systems. Here, a planar pattern consists of many big patches, and a big patch can be regarded as combination of many patches on the plane. The consumer moves between patches asymmetrically, while the asymmetry is driven by the resource abundance. Based on experimental models with linearly-linked patches, we propose a planarly-linked-patch model with asymmetric dispersal. Using dynamical systems theory, we show global stability of equilibria in the model, and demonstrate how the resource-driven dispersal forms patterns. It is shown that appropriate asymmetry in dispersal would make the consumer persist in the system, even in sink patches. The asymmetry could also make the consumer’s total population abundance larger than that without dispersal. However, inappropriate asymmetry would make the consumer go into extinction, even in source patches. Dispersal rates are also shown to play a role in the persistence and abundance increase. Our results are consistent with experimental observations and provide new insights. Numerical simulations by the model reproduce various vegetation patterns in the real world. This work has potential applications in spatial pattern formation in biological research.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This work concerns the asymptotic analysis of high-frequency wave propagation in randomly layered media with fast variations and long-range correlations. The analysis takes place in the three-dimensional physical space and weak-coupling regime. The role played by the slow decay of the correlations on a propagating pulse is twofold. First we observe a random travel time characterized by a fractional Brownian motion that appears to have a standard deviation larger than the pulse width, which is in contrast with the standard O’Doherty–Anstey theory for random propagation media with mixing properties. Second, a deterministic pulse deformation is described as the solution of a paraxial wave equation involving a pseudodifferential operator. This operator is characterized by the autocorrelation function of the medium fluctuations. In case of fluctuations with long-range correlations this operator is close to a fractional Weyl derivative whose order, between 2 and 3, depends on the power decay of the autocorrelation function. In the frequency domain, the pseudodifferential operator exhibits a frequency-dependent power-law attenuation with exponent corresponding to the order of the fractional derivative, and a frequency-dependent phase modulation, both ensuring the causality of the limiting paraxial wave equation as well as the Kramers–Kronig relations. The mathematical analysis is based on an approximation-diffusion theorem for random ordinary differential equations with long-range correlations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The mathematical modeling and the stability analysis of multilane traffic in the macroscopic scale is considered. We propose a new first order model derived from microscopic dynamics with lane changing, leading to a coupled system of hyperbolic balance laws. The macroscopic limit is derived without assuming ad hoc space and time scalings. The analysis of the stability of the equilibria of the model is discussed. The proposed numerical tests confirm the theoretical findings between the macroscopic and microscopic modeling, and the results of the stability analysis.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Competitive systems can exhibit both hierarchical (transitive) and cyclic (intransitive) structures. Despite theoretical interest in cyclic competition, which offers richer dynamics and occupies a larger subset of the scope of possible competitive systems, most real-world systems are predominantly transitive. Why? Here, we introduce a generic mechanism that promotes transitivity, even when there is ample room for cyclicity. We demonstrate that, if competitive outcomes depend smoothly on competitor attributes, then similar competitors compete transitively. We quantify the rate of convergence to transitivity given the similarity of the competitors and the smoothness of the performance function. Thus, we prove the adage regarding apples and oranges. Similar objects admit well-ordered comparisons; diverse objects may not.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Let [math] be a multigraph with a set [math] of terminals. A path in [math] is called a [math]-path if its ends are distinct vertices in [math] and no internal vertices belong to [math]. In 1978, Mader showed a characterization of the maximum number of edge-disjoint [math]-paths. In this paper, we provide a combinatorial, deterministic algorithm for finding the maximum number of edge-disjoint [math]-paths. The algorithm adopts an augmenting path approach. More specifically, we utilize a new concept of short augmenting walks in auxiliary labeled graphs to capture a possible augmentation of the number of edge-disjoint [math]-paths. To design a search procedure for a short augmenting walk, we introduce blossoms analogously to the matching algorithm of Edmonds [Canad. J. Math., 17, 1965, pp. 449–467]. When the search procedure terminates without finding a short augmenting walk, the algorithm provides a certificate for the optimality of the current edge-disjoint [math]-paths. From this certificate, one can obtain the Edmonds–Gallai type decomposition introduced by Sebő and Szegő [Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization, LNCS 3064, Springer, Berlin, 2004, pp. 256–270]. The algorithm runs in [math] time, which is much faster than the best known deterministic algorithm based on a reduction to linear matroid parity. We also present a strongly polynomial algorithm for the maximum integer free multiflow problem, which asks for a nonnegative integer combination of [math]-paths maximizing the sum of the coefficients subject to capacity constraints on the edges.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Recent advances in high-resolution experimental methods have highlighted the significance of cell signal pathway crosstalk and localized signaling activity in the development and disease of numerous biological systems. The investigation of multiple signal pathways often introduces different methods of cell-cell communication, i.e., contact-based or diffusive signaling, which generates both a spatial and a temporal dependence on cell behaviors. Motivated by cellular mechanisms that control cell-fate decisions in developing bilayer tissues, we use dynamical systems coupled with multilayer graphs to analyze the role of signaling polarity and pathway crosstalk in fine-grain pattern formation of protein activity. Specifically, we study how multilayer graph edge structures and weights influence the layerwise (laminar) patterning of cells in bilayer structures, which are commonly found in glandular tissues. We present sufficient conditions for the existence, uniqueness, and instability of homogeneous cell states in the large-scale spatially discrete dynamical system. Using methods of pattern templating by graph partitioning to generate quotient systems, in combination with concepts from monotone dynamical systems, we exploit the extensive dimensionality reduction to provide existence conditions for the polarity required to induce fine-grain laminar patterns with multiple spatially dependent intracellular components. We then explore the spectral links between the quotient and large-scale dynamical systems to extend the laminar patterning criteria from existence to convergence for sufficiently large amounts of cellular polarity in the large-scale dynamical system, independent of spatial dimension and number of cells in the tissue.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We consider the inverse medium scattering of reconstructing the medium contrast using Born data, including the full-aperture, limited-aperture, and multifrequency data. We propose data-driven basis functions for these inverse problems based on the generalized prolate spheroidal wave functions and related eigenfunctions. Such data-driven eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of a Fourier integral operator; they remarkably extend analytically to the whole space, are doubly orthogonal, and are complete in the class of band-limited functions. We first establish a Picard criterion for reconstructing the contrast using the data-driven basis, where the reconstruction formula can also be understood from the viewpoint of data processing and analytic extrapolation. Another salient feature associated with the generalized prolate spheroidal wave functions is that the data-driven basis for a disk is also a basis for a Sturm–Liouville differential operator. With the help of Sturm–Liouville theory, we estimate the [math] approximation error for a spectral cutoff approximation of [math] functions. This yields a spectral cutoff regularization strategy for noisy data and an explicit stability estimate for contrast in [math] ([math]) in the full-aperture case. In the limited-aperture and multifrequency cases, we also obtain spectral cutoff regularization strategies for noisy data and stability estimates for a class of contrast.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The ellipsoid method is an algorithm that solves the (weak) feasibility and linear optimization problems for convex sets by making oracle calls to their (weak) separation problem. We observe that the previously known method for showing that this reduction can be done in fixed-point logic with counting (FPC) for linear and semidefinite programs applies to any family of explicitly bounded convex sets. We further show that the exact feasibility problem for semidefinite programs is expressible in the infinitary version of FPC. As a corollary, we get that, for the graph isomorphism problem, the Lasserre/sums-of-squares semidefinite programming hierarchy of relaxations collapses to the Sherali–Adams linear programming hierarchy, up to a small loss in the degree.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We propose to adopt statistical regression as the projection operator to enable data-driven learning of the operators in the Mori–Zwanzig formalism. We present a principled method to extract the Markov and memory operators for any regression models. We show that the choice of linear regression results in a recently proposed data-driven learning algorithm based on Mori’s projection operator, which is a higher-order approximate Koopman learning method. We show that more expressive nonlinear regression models naturally fill in the gap between the highly idealized and computationally efficient Mori’s projection operator and the most optimal yet computationally infeasible Zwanzig’s projection operator. We performed numerical experiments and extracted the operators for an array of regression-based projections, including linear, polynomial, spline, and neural network–based regressions, showing a progressive improvement as the complexity of the regression model increased. Our proposition provides a general framework to extract memory-dependent corrections and can be readily applied to an array of data-driven learning methods for stationary dynamical systems in the literature.]]></summary>

 Abstract. To address noise inherent in electronic data acquisition systems and real-world sources, Araki et al. [Phys. D, 417 (2021), 132819] demonstrated a grid-based nonlinear technique to remove noise from a chaotic signal, leveraging a clean high-fidelity signal from the same dynamical system and ensemble averaging in multidimensional phase space. This method achieved denoising of a time series data with 100% added noise but suffered in regions of low data density. To improve this grid-based method, here an unstructured mesh based on triangulations and Voronoi diagrams is used to accomplish the same task. The unstructured mesh more uniformly distributes data samples over mesh cells to improve the accuracy of the reconstructed signal. By empirically balancing bias and variance errors in selecting the number of unstructured cells as a function of the number of available samples, the method achieves asymptotic statistical convergence with known test data and reduces synthetic noise on experimental signals from Hall effect thrusters with greater success than the original grid-based strategy.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We precisely and rigorously characterize the decay of elastic fields generated by dislocations in crystalline materials, focusing specifically on the role of multilattices. Concretely, we establish that the elastic field generated by a dislocation in a multilattice can be decomposed into a continuum field predicted by a linearized Cauchy–Born elasticity theory, and a discrete and nonlinear core corrector representing the defect core. We demonstrate both analytically and numerically the consequences of this result for cell size effects in numerical simulations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The generalized spectral theory is an effective approach to analyze a linear operator on a Hilbert space [math] with a continuous spectrum. The generalized spectrum is computed via analytic continuations of the resolvent operators using a dense locally convex subspace [math] of [math] and its dual space [math]. The three topological spaces [math] are called the rigged Hilbert space or the Gelfand triplet. In this paper, the generalized spectra of the Perron–Frobenius operators of the one-sided and two-sided shifts of finite type (symbolic dynamical systems) are determined. A one-sided subshift of finite type which is conjugate to the multiplication with the golden ratio on [math] modulo 1 is also considered. A new construction of the Gelfand triplet for the generalized spectrum of symbolic dynamical systems is proposed by means of an algebraic procedure. The asymptotic formula of the iteration of Perron–Frobenius operators is also given. The iteration converges to the mixing state whose rate of convergence is determined by the generalized spectrum.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We develop an algorithm for the equivariant divergence formula of the unstable perturbation of unstable transfer operators, by progressively computing [math] many bounded vectors or covectors on one orbit, where [math] is the unstable dimension. Combining this with the nonintrusive adjoint shadowing algorithm, we obtain the fast adjoint response algorithm for the linear responses on physical measures of discrete-time uniformly hyperbolic systems. The cost is independent of the number of parameters. We demonstrate our algorithm on a 21-dimensional chaotic system, a system with stochastic noise, and systems with discontinuities. Unlike previous methods, our algorithms are not cursed by dimensionality or the sensitive dependence on initial conditions.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper considers a deterministic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) networked bivirus epidemic model (termed the bivirus model for short), in which two competing viruses spread through a set of populations (nodes) connected by two graphs, which may be different if the two viruses have different transmission pathways. The networked dynamics can give rise to complex equilibria patterns, and most current results identify conditions on the model parameters for convergence to the healthy equilibrium (where both viruses are extinct) or a boundary equilibrium (where one virus is endemic and the other is extinct). However, there are only limited results on coexistence equilibria (where both viruses are endemic). This paper establishes a set of “counting” results which provide lower bounds on the number of coexistence equilibria and, perhaps more importantly, establish properties on the local stability/instability properties of these equilibria. In order to do this, we employ the Poincaré–Hopf theorem but with significant modifications to overcome several challenges arising from the bivirus system model, such as the fact that the system dynamics do not evolve on a manifold in the typical sense required to apply Poincaré–Hopf theory. Subsequently, Morse inequalities are used to tighten the counting results, under the reasonable assumption that the bivirus system is a Morse–Smale dynamical system. Numerical examples are provided which demonstrate the presence of multiple attractor equilibria and multiple coexistence equilibria.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
We present a framework for the structure-preserving approximation of partial differential equations on mapped multipatch domains, extending the classical theory of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) to discrete de Rham sequences which are broken, i.e., fully discontinuous across the patch interfaces. Following the Conforming/Nonconforming Galerkin (CONGA) schemes developed in Campos Pinto and Sonnendrücker (Math Comput 85:2651–2685, 2016) and Campos Pinto and Güçlü (Broken-FEEC discretizations and Hodge Laplace problems. arXiv:2109.02553, 2022), our approach is based on: (i) the identification of a conforming discrete de Rham sequence with stable commuting projection operators, (ii) the relaxation of the continuity constraints between patches, and (iii) the construction of conforming projections mapping back to the conforming subspaces, allowing to define discrete differentials on the broken sequence. This framework combines the advantages of conforming FEEC discretizations (e.g. commuting projections, discrete duality and Hodge–Helmholtz decompositions) with the data locality and implementation simplicity of interior penalty methods for discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. We apply it to several initial- and boundary-value problems, as well as eigenvalue problems arising in electromagnetics. In each case our formulations are shown to be well posed thanks to an appropriate stabilization of the jumps across the interfaces, and the solutions are extremely robust with respect to the stabilization parameter. Finally we describe a construction using tensor-product splines on mapped cartesian patches, and we detail the associated matrix operators. Our numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and stability of this discrete framework, and they allow us to verify that expected structure-preserving properties such as divergence or harmonic constraints are respected to floating-point accuracy.]]></summary>

We present an efficient a posteriori error control strategy for an energy-based concurrent multiscale method with sharp interface in molecular mechanics, namely the geometric reconstruction based atomistic/continuum coupling method (GRAC). For the problem of the adaptive simulation of a range of crystal defects with practical importance, we develop an adaptive algorithm for the GRAC method based on a theory based modification of the residual based a posteriori error estimator and a specially designed mesh structure. In particular, by exploiting the decay of the displacement of the crystal caused by the defects, we are able to prove that the numerically expensive modeling residual estimator, which often exists in concurrent multiscale schemes, can be appropriately approximated by the inexpensive coarsening residual estimator in certain region which results in a significantly improvement of the efficiency of the adaptivity. The numerical experiments show that our adaptive strategy based on the modified error estimator and special mesh structure with properly chosen parameters leads to the same optimal convergence rate of the error but reduces the computational cost measured in CPU times by one order with respect to the number of degrees of freedom compared with that based on the original residual based error estimator.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Momentum space transformations for incommensurate two-dimensional electronic structure calculations are fundamental for reducing computational cost and for representing the data in a more physically motivating format, as exemplified in the Bistritzer–MacDonald model [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 108 (2011), pp. 12233–12237]. However, these transformations can be difficult to implement in more complex systems such as when mechanical relaxation patterns are present. In this work, we aim for two objectives. First, we strive to simplify the understanding and implementation of this transformation by rigorously writing the transformations between the four relevant spaces, which we denote real space, configuration space, momentum space, and reciprocal space. This provides a straightforward algorithm for writing the complex momentum space model from the original real space model. Second, we implement this for twisted bilayer graphene with mechanical relaxation effects included. We also analyze the convergence rates of the approximations and show the tight-binding coupling range increases for smaller relative twists between layers, demonstrating that the 3-nearest neighbor coupling of the Bistritzer–MacDonald model is insufficient when mechanical relaxation is included for very small angles. We quantify this and verify with numerical simulation.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Motivated by the control of complex microbiota for reducing infection by a pathogenic agent, we introduce the theoretical framework from optimal control to analyze this problem. Two complementary approaches can be applied in the analysis: one is the so-called permanent case, where no digital constraints are concerned with the control (taken as a measurable mapping); the other is the sampled-data control case taking into account the logistic constraints, e.g., frequency of the medical interventions. The model is the n-dimensional Lotka–Volterra equation controlled using either probiotics or antibiotic agents or a combination of transplantation and bactericides. In this article, we concentrate on the permanent case associated to the probiotic or antibiotic agent. The maximum principle is used to parameterize the geodesics, and the optimal synthesis boils down to analyzing mainly the singular trajectories and their concatenation with bang arcs.]]></summary>

We present an hp-adaptive discretization for a sharp interface model with a level-set ghost-fluid method to simulate compressible multiphase flows. The scheme applies an efficient p-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin (DG) operator in regions of smooth flow. Shocks and the phase interface are captured by a Finite Volume (FV) scheme on a h-refined element-local sub-grid. The resulting hp-adaptive scheme thus combines both the high order accuracy of the DG method and the robustness of the FV scheme by using p-adaptation in smooth areas and h-refinement at discontinuities, respectively. For the level-set based interface tracking, a similar hybrid DG/FV operator is employed. Both p-refinement and FV shock and interface capturing are performed at runtime and controlled by an indicator, which is based on the modal decay of the solution polynomials. In parallel simulations, the hp-adaptive discretization together with the costly interface tracking algorithm cause a significant imbalance in the processor workloads. To ensure parallel efficiency, we propose a dynamic load balancing scheme that determines the workload distribution by element-local wall time measurements and redistributes elements along a space filling curve. The parallelization strategy is supported by strong scaling tests using up to 8192 cores. The framework is applied to established benchmarks problems for inviscid, compressible multiphase flows. The results demonstrate that the hybrid adaptive discretization can efficiently and accurately handle complex multiphase flow problems involving pronounced interface deformations and merging interface contours.]]></summary>

 Abstract. High entropy alloys (HEAs) are a class of novel materials that exhibit superb engineering properties. It has been demonstrated by extensive experiments and first principles/atomistic simulations that short-range order in the atomic level randomness strongly influences the properties of HEAs. In this paper, we derive stochastic continuum models for HEAs with short-range order from atomistic models. A proper continuum limit is obtained such that the mean and variance of the atomic level randomness together with the short-range order described by a characteristic length are kept in the process from the atomistic interaction model to the continuum equation. The obtained continuum model with short-range order is in the form of an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process. This validates the continuum model based on the OU process adopted phenomenologically by Zhang et al. [Acta Mater., 166 (2019), pp. 424–434] for HEAs with short-range order. We derive such stochastic continuum models with short-range order for both (i) the elastic deformation in HEAs without defects and (ii) HEAs with dislocations (line defects). The obtained stochastic continuum models are based on the energy formulations, whose variations lead to stochastic partial differential equations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A wide variety of stationary or moving spatially localized structures is present in evolution problems on unbounded domains, governed by higher-than-second-order reversible spatial interactions. This work provides a generic unfolding in one spatial dimension of a certain codimension-three singularity that explains the organization of bifurcation diagrams of such localized states in a variety of contexts, ranging from nonlinear optics to fluid mechanics, mathematical biology, and beyond. The singularity occurs when a cusp bifurcation associated with the onset of bistability between homogeneous steady states encounters a pattern-forming, or Turing, bifurcation. The latter corresponds to a Hamiltonian-Hopf point of the corresponding spatial dynamics problem. Such codimension-three points are sometimes called Lifshitz points in the physics literature. In the simplest case where the spatial system conserves a first integral, the system is described by a canonical fourth-order scalar system. The problem contains three small parameters: two that unfold the cusp bifurcation and one that unfolds the Turing bifurcation. Several cases are revealed, depending on open conditions on the signs of the lowest-order nonlinear terms. Taking the case in which the Turing bifurcation is subcritical, various parameter regimes are considered and the bifurcation diagrams of localized structures are elucidated. A rich bifurcation structure is revealed which involves transitions between regions of localized periodic patterns generated by standard homoclinic snaking, and regions of stationary domains of one homogeneous solution embedded in the other organized in a collapsed snaking structure. The theory is shown to unify previous numerical results obtained in models arising in nonlinear optics, fluid mechanics, and excitable media more generally.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A function with finite asymptotic limits gives rise to a transition equation between a “past system” and a “future system.” This question is analyzed in the case of nonautonomous coercive nonlinear scalar ordinary differential equations with concave derivative with respect to the state variable. The fundamental hypothesis is the existence of three hyperbolic solutions for the limit systems, in which case the upper and lower ones are attractive. All the global dynamical possibilities are described in terms of the internal dynamics of the pullback attractor: cases of tracking of the two hyperbolic attractive solutions or lack of it (tipping) may arise. This analysis, made in the language of processes and also in terms of the skewproduct formulation of the problem, includes cases of rate-induced critical transitions, as well as cases of phase-induced and size-induced tipping. The conclusions are applied in models of mathematical biology and population dynamics. Rate-induced tracking phenomena causing extinction of a native species or invasion of a nonnative one are described, as well as population models affected by a Holling type III functional response to predation where tipping due to the changes in the size of the transition may occur. In all these cases, the appearance of a critical transition can be understood as a consequence of the strength of the Allee effect.]]></summary>
