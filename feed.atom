 Abstract. Generalized mass-action systems are power-law dynamical systems arising from chemical reaction networks. Essentially, every nonnegative ODE model used in chemistry and biology (for example, in ecology and epidemiology) and even in economics and engineering can be written in this form. Previous results have focused on existence and uniqueness of special steady states (complex-balanced equilibria) for all rate constants, thereby ruling out multiple (special) steady states. Recently, necessary conditions for linear stability have been obtained. In this work, we provide sufficient conditions for the linear stability of complex-balanced equilibria for all rate constants (and also for the nonexistence of other steady states). In particular, via sign vector conditions (on the stoichiometric coefficients and kinetic orders), we guarantee that the Jacobian matrix is a [math]-matrix. Technically, we use a new decomposition of the graph Laplacian which allows us to consider orders of (generalized) monomials. Alternatively, we use cycle decomposition which allows a linear parametrization of all Jacobian matrices. In any case, we guarantee stability without explicit computation of steady states. We illustrate our results in examples from chemistry and biology: generalized Lotka–Volterra systems and SIR models, a two-component signaling system, and an enzymatic futile cycle.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We investigate the effect of bias on the formation and dynamics of opinion clusters in the bounded confidence model. For weak bias, we quantify the change in average opinion and potential dispersion and decrease in cluster size. For nonlinear bias modeling self-incitement, we establish coherent drifting motion of clusters on a background of uniform opinion distribution for biases below a critical threshold where clusters dissolve. Technically, we use geometric singular perturbation theory to derive drift speeds, we rely on a nonlocal center manifold analysis to construct drifting clusters near threshold, and we implement numerical continuation in a forward-backward delay equation to connect asymptotic regimes.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This article presents a new method to reconstruct slowly varying width defects in two-dimensional waveguides using one-side section measurements at locally resonant frequencies. At these frequencies, locally resonant modes propagate in the waveguide up to a “cut-off” position. In this particular point, the local width of the waveguide can be recovered. Given multifrequency data measured on a section of the waveguide, we perform an efficient layer stripping approach to recover, section by section, the shape variations. It provides an L infinity-stable method to reconstruct the width of a slowly monotonous varying waveguide. We validate this method on numerical data and discuss its limits.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Model reduction of fast-slow chemical reaction networks based on the quasi-steady state approximation fails when the fast subsystem has first integrals. We call these first integrals approximate conservation laws. In order to define fast subsystems and identify approximate conservation laws, we use ideas from tropical geometry. We prove that any approximate conservation law evolves more slowly than all the species involved in it and therefore represents a supplementary slow variable in an extended system. By elimination of some variables of the extended system, we obtain networks without approximate conservation laws, which can be reduced by standard singular perturbation methods. The field of applications of approximate conservation laws covers the quasi-equilibrium approximation, which is well known in biochemistry. We discuss reductions of slow-fast as well as multiple timescale systems. Networks with multiple timescales have hierarchical relaxation. At a given timescale, our multiple timescale reduction method defines three subsystems composed of (i) slaved fast variables satisfying algebraic equations, (ii) slow driving variables satisfying reduced ordinary differential equations, and (iii) quenched much slower variables that are constant. The algebraic equations satisfied by fast variables define chains of nested normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds. In such chains, faster manifolds are of higher dimension and contain the slower manifolds. Our reduction methods are introduced algorithmically for networks with monomial reaction rates and linear, monomial, or polynomial approximate conservation laws. We propose symbolic algorithms to reshape and rescale the networks such that geometric singular perturbation theory can be applied to them, test the applicability of the theory, and finally reduce the networks. As a proof of concept, we apply this method to a model of the TGF-beta signaling pathway.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A multiscale method is proposed for a parabolic stochastic partial differential equation with additive noise and highly oscillatory diffusion. The framework is based on the localized orthogonal decomposition (LOD) method and computes a coarse-scale representation of the elliptic operator, enriched by fine-scale information on the diffusion. Optimal order strong convergence is derived. The LOD technique is combined with a (multilevel) Monte Carlo estimator and the weak error is analyzed. Numerical examples that confirm the theoretical findings are provided, and the computational efficiency of the method is highlighted.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper presents a novel estimator for a nonstandard restriction to both symmetry and low rank in the context of high-dimensional cointegrated processes. Furthermore, we discuss rank estimation for high-dimensional cointegrated processes by restricted bootstrapping of the Gaussian innovations. We demonstrate that the classical rank test for cointegrated systems is prone to underestimating the true rank and demonstrate this effect in a 100-dimensional system. We also discuss the implications of this underestimation for such high-dimensional systems in general. Also, we define a linearized Kuramoto system and present a simulation study, where we infer the cointegration rank of the unrestricted [math] system and successively the underlying clustered network structure based on a graphical approach and a symmetrized low rank estimator of the couplings derived from a reparametrization of the likelihood under this unusual restriction.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Critical Reynolds numbers for the monotone exponential energy stability of Couette and Poiseuille plane flows were obtained by Orr in 1907 [Proc. Roy. Irish Acad. A, 27 (1907), pp. 9–68, 69–138] in a famous paper, and by Joseph in 1966 [J. Fluid Mech., 33 (1966), pp. 617–621], Joseph and Carmi in 1969 [Quart. Appl. Math., 26 (1969), pp. 575–579], and Busse in 1972 [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 47 (1972), pp. 28–35]. All these authors obtained their results applying variational methods to compute the maximum of a functional ratio derived from the Reynolds–Orr energy identity. Orr and Joseph obtained different results; for instance, in the Couette case Orr computed the critical Reynolds value of 44.3 (on spanwise perturbations) and Joseph 20.65 (on streamwise perturbations). Recently in [P. Falsaperla, G. Mulone, and C. Perrone, Eur. J. Mech. B Fluids, 93 (2022), pp. 93–100], the authors conjectured that the search of the maximum should be restricted to a subspace of the space of kinematically admissible perturbations. With this conjecture, the critical nonlinear energy Reynolds number was found among spanwise perturbations (a Squire theorem for nonlinear systems). With a direct proof and an appropriate and original decomposition of the dissipation terms in the Reynolds–Orr identity we show the validity of this conjecture in the space of three-dimensional perturbations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is widely applied in medical diagnosis, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Combining the physical principles of the imaging system with the advantages of data-driven deep learning networks, physics-embedded deep unrolling networks have recently emerged as a promising solution in computational imaging. However, the inherent nonlinear and ill-posed properties of EIT image reconstruction still present challenges to existing methods in terms of accuracy and stability. To tackle this challenge, we propose the learned half-quadratic splitting (HQSNet) algorithm for incorporating physics into learning-based EIT imaging. We then apply Anderson acceleration (AA) to the HQSNet algorithm, denoted as AA-HQSNet, which can be interpreted as AA applied to the Gauss-Newton step and the learned proximal gradient descent step of the HQSNet, respectively. AA is a widely-used technique for accelerating the convergence of fixed-point iterative algorithms and has gained significant interest in numerical optimization and machine learning. However, the technique has received little attention in the inverse problems community thus far. Employing AA enhances the convergence rate compared to the standard HQSNet while simultaneously avoiding artifacts in the reconstructions. Lastly, we conduct rigorous numerical and visual experiments to show that the AA module strengthens the HQSNet, leading to robust, accurate, and considerably superior reconstructions compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our Anderson acceleration scheme to enhance HQSNet is generic and can be applied to improve the performance of various physics-embedded deep learning methods.]]></summary>

In this work, two Crank–Nicolson schemes without corrections are developed for sub-diffusion equations. First, we propose a Crank–Nicolson scheme without correction for problems with regularity assumptions only on the source term. Second, since the existing Crank–Nicolson schemes have a severe reduction of convergence order for solving sub-diffusion equations with singular source terms in time, we then extend our scheme and propose a new Crank–Nicolson scheme for problems with singular source terms in time. Second-order error estimates for both the two Crank–Nicolson schemes are rigorously established by a Laplace transform technique, which are verified by some numerical examples.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we study two-grid preconditioners for three-dimensional single-phase nonlinear compressible flow in highly heterogeneous porous media arising from reservoir simulation. Our goal is to develop robust and efficient preconditioners that converge independently of the contrast of the media and types of boundary conditions and source term. This is accomplished by constructing coarse space that can capture important features of the local heterogeneous media. To detect these features, local eigenvalue problems are defined and eigenvectors are adaptively selected to form the coarse space. The coarse space just needs to be constructed only once with parallel computing, although the compressible flow is a time-dependent problem and the permeability field changes in different time steps. Smoothers such as Gauss–Seidel iteration and ILU(0) are used to remove high-frequency errors. We analyze this preconditioner by proving the smoothing property and approximation property. In particular, a new coarse interpolation operator is defined to facilitate the analysis. Extensive numerical experiments with different types of large-scale heterogeneous permeability fields and boundary conditions are provided to show the impressive performance of the proposed preconditioner.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The distinct timescales of synaptic plasticity and neural activity dynamics play an important role in the brain’s learning and memory systems. Activity-dependent plasticity reshapes neural circuit architecture, determining spontaneous and stimulus-encoding spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity. Neural activity bumps maintain short term memories of continuous parameter values, emerging in spatially organized models with short-range excitation and long-range inhibition. Previously, we demonstrated nonlinear Langevin equations derived using an interface method which accurately describe the dynamics of bumps in continuum neural fields with separate excitatory/inhibitory populations. Here we extend this analysis to incorporate effects of short term plasticity that dynamically modifies connectivity described by an integral kernel. Linear stability analysis adapted to these piecewise smooth models with Heaviside firing rates further indicates how plasticity shapes the bumps’ local dynamics. Facilitation (depression), which strengthens (weakens) synaptic connectivity originating from active neurons, tends to increase (decrease) stability of bumps when acting on excitatory synapses. The relationship is inverted when plasticity acts on inhibitory synapses. Multiscale approximations of the stochastic dynamics of bumps perturbed by weak noise reveal that the plasticity variables evolve to slowly diffusing and blurred versions of their stationary profiles. Nonlinear Langevin equations associated with bump positions or interfaces coupled to slowly evolving projections of plasticity variables accurately describe how these smoothed synaptic efficacy profiles can tether or repel wandering bumps.]]></summary>

 Abstract.In view of the molecular biological mechanism of the cytotoxic T lymphocytes proliferation induced by hepatitis B virus infection in vivo, a novel dynamical model with interval delay is proposed. The interval delay is determined by two delay parameters, namely delay center and delay radius. We derive the basic reproduction number [math] for the viral infection and obtain that the virus-free equilibrium (VFE) is globally asymptotically stable if [math]. When [math], besides VFE, the unique virus-present equilibrium (VPE) exists and the conditions of its asymptotical stability are obtained. Moreover, we study the Hopf bifurcations induced by the two delay parameters. Although there is no mitotic term in the target-cell dynamics, the results indicate that both these delay parameters can lead to periodic fluctuations at VPE, but only the smaller delay radius will destabilize the system, which is different from the classical discrete delay or distributed delay. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed model can capture the profiles of the clinical data of two untreated chronic hepatitis B patients. The ability of interval delay to destabilize the system is between discrete delay and distributed delay, and the delay center plays the primary role. Pharmaceutical treatment can affect the stability of VPE and induce the fast-slow periodic phenomenon.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Let [math] be two multiplicatively independent integers. Cobham’s famous theorem states that a set [math] is both [math]-recognizable and [math]-recognizable if and only if it is definable in Presburger arithmetic. Here we show the following strengthening: let [math] be [math]-recognizable, and let [math] be [math]-recognizable such that both [math] and [math] are not definable in Presburger arithmetic. Then the first-order logical theory of [math] is undecidable. This is in contrast to a well-known theorem of Büchi stating that the first-order logical theory of [math] is decidable.]]></summary>

This paper proposes a unified approach for pricing discretely monitored floating and fixed strike Asian options under a broad class of regime-switching and stochastic volatility models with jumps. The randomness in volatility can be either characterized by regime switching among discrete market states, a diffusive stochastic variance process correlated with the underlying asset price, or a random time change applied to a background process. Our approach can be applied to price financial derivatives with exotic averaging type payoffs, which goes beyond most of the existing frameworks in terms of versatility. Our success relies on the adoption of the change-of-measure approach and a dimension reduction technique. Specifically, we construct new backward recursions for Asian options that include floating and fixed strike payoffs under a wide range of regime-switching and stochastic volatility models with jumps. The Fourier-cosine series expansion and Gauss quadrature rule are applied to solve the backward recursions. The exponential convergence rate of our approach is proven theoretically and verified numerically via comprehensive error analysis. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach is reliable, accurate, and efficient.]]></summary>

We introduce a robust numerical strategy for the numerical simulation of several free-boundary problems arising in the study of nonlinear wave–structure interactions in shallow-water flows. We investigate two types of boundary-evolution equations: (1) a kinematic-type equation, associated with the interaction of waves with a moving lateral wall, (2) a fully-nonlinear singular equation modeling the evolution of the interface between a solid obstacle placed on the surface and the fluid. At the continuous level, the flow is globally modeled with the hyperbolic Nonlinear Shallow-Water (NSW) equations, including varying topography, and at the discrete level, an arbitrary-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is stabilized with a Local Subcell Correction (LSC) method. Mimicking the theoretical study of the continuous problem, suitable diffeomorphisms are introduced to recast the moving-boundary problems into fixed-boundary ones, and to compute the boundary’s evolution through an Arbitrary-Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) description. For any order of polynomial approximation, the resulting global algorithm is shown to: (1) preserve the Discrete Geometric Conservation Law (DGCL), (2) ensure the preservation of the water height positivity at the sub-cell level, (3) preserve the class of motionless steady-states (well-balancing), possibly with the occurrence of a partly immersed obstacle. Several numerical computations highlight that the proposed strategy: (1) effectively approximates the new free-boundary IBVPs introduced in Iguchi and Lannes (Indiana Univ Math J 70:353–464, 2021), (2) is able to accurately handle strong flow singularities without any robustness issues, (3) retains the highly accurate subcell resolution of DG schemes.]]></summary>

DMRM is a new deep-learning based method for solving PDEs and it has been shown to be efficient and accurate in previous studies. Our work is the first theoretical study of DMRM. We prove that the neural network solutions will converge if we increase the training samples and network size without any constraint on the ratio of training samples to the network size. Besides, our results suggest that the DMRM can approximate the Laplacian of the solution by the intermediate auxiliary variable, which is dismissing in the deep Ritz method.

 Abstract.We analyze the dynamics of networks in which a central pattern generator (CPG) transmits signals along one or more feedforward chains in a synchronous or phase-synchronous manner. Such propagating signals are common in biology, especially in locomotion and peristalsis, and are of interest for continuum robots. We construct such networks as feedforward lifts of the CPG. If the CPG dynamics is periodic, so is the lifted dynamics. Synchrony with the CPG manifests as a standing wave, and a regular phase pattern creates a traveling wave. We discuss Liapunov, asymptotic, and Floquet stability of the lifted periodic orbit and introduce transverse versions of these conditions that imply stability for signals propagating along arbitrarily long chains. We compare these notions to a simpler condition, transverse stability of the synchrony subspace, which is equivalent to Floquet stability when nodes are 1 dimensional.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We identify a taxonomic property on the growth functions in the multispecies chemostat model which ensures the coexistence of a subset of species under periodic removal rate. We show that proportions of some powers of the species densities are periodic functions, leading to an infinity of distinct neutrally stable periodic orbits depending on the initial condition. This condition on the species for neutral stability possesses the feature to be independent of the shape of the periodic signal for a given mean value. We also give conditions allowing the coexistence of two distinct subsets of species. Although these conditions are nongeneric, we show in simulations that when these conditions are only approximately satisfied, the behavior of the solutions is close to that of the nongeneric case over a long time interval, justifying the interest of our study.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this article, an improved self-consistent field iteration scheme is introduced. The proposed method has essential applications in Kohn–Sham density functional theory and relies on an extrapolation scheme and the least squares method. Moreover, the proposed solution is easy to implement and can accelerate the convergence of self-consistent field iteration. The main idea is to fit out a polynomial based on the errors of the derived approximate solutions and then extrapolate the errors into zero to obtain a new approximation. The developed scheme can be applied not only to the Kohn–Sham density functional theory but also to accelerate the self-consistent field iterations of other nonlinear equations. Some numerical results for the Kohn–Sham equation and general nonlinear equations are presented to validate the efficiency of the new method.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Stochastic systems often exhibit multiple viable metastable states that are long-lived. Over very long timescales, fluctuations may push the system to transition between them, drastically changing its macroscopic configuration. In realistic systems, these transitions can happen via multiple physical mechanisms, corresponding to multiple distinct transition channels for a pair of states. In this paper, we use the fact that the transition path ensemble is equivalent to the invariant measure of a gradient flow in pathspace, which can be efficiently sampled via metadynamics. We demonstrate how this pathspace metadynamics, previously restricted to reversible molecular dynamics, is in fact very generally applicable to metastable stochastic systems, including irreversible and time-dependent ones, and allows rigorous estimation of the relative probability of competing transition paths. We showcase this approach on the study of a stochastic partial differential equation describing magnetic field reversal in the presence of advection.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The aim of this paper is to present a method to compute parameterizations of partially hyperbolic invariant tori and their invariant bundles in nonautonomous quasi-periodic Hamiltonian systems. We generalize flow map parameterization methods to the quasi-periodic setting. To this end, we introduce the notion of fiberwise isotropic tori and sketch definitions and results on fiberwise symplectic deformations and their moment maps. These constructs are vital to work in a suitable setting and lead to the proofs of “magic cancellations” that guarantee the existence of solutions of cohomological equations. We apply our algorithms in the elliptic restricted three body problem and compute nonresonant 3-dimensional invariant tori and their invariant bundles around the [math] point.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Repulsion between individuals within a finite radius is encountered in numerous applications, including cell exclusion, i.e., avoidance of overlapping cells, bird flocks, or microscopic pedestrian models. We define such individual-based particle dynamics in one spatial dimension with minimal assumptions of the repulsion force [math] as well as their external velocity [math] and prove their characteristic properties. Moreover, we are able to perform a rigorous limit from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale, where we could recover the finite interaction radius as a density threshold. Specific choices for the repulsion force [math] lead to well-known nonlinear diffusion equations on the macroscopic scale, as, e.g., the porous medium equation. At both scaling levels, numerical simulations are presented and compared to underline the analytical results.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We analyze the well-posedness of certain field-only boundary integral equations (BIEs) for frequency domain electromagnetic scattering from perfectly conducting spheres. Starting from the observations that (1) the three components of the scattered electric field [math] and (2) scalar quantity [math] are radiative solutions of the Helmholtz equation, we see that novel boundary integral equation formulations of electromagnetic scattering from perfectly conducting obstacles can be derived using Green’s identities applied to the aforementioned quantities and the boundary conditions on the surface of the scatterer. The unknowns of these formulations are the normal derivatives of the three components of the scattered electric field and the normal component of the scattered electric field on the surface of the scatterer, and thus these formulations are referred to as field-only BIEs. In this paper we use the combined field methodology of Burton and Miller within the field-only BIE approach, and we derive new boundary integral formulations that feature only Helmholtz boundary integral operators, which we subsequently show to be well posed for all positive frequencies in the case of spherical scatterers. Relying on the spectral properties of Helmholtz boundary integral operators in spherical geometries, we show that the combined field-only boundary integral operators are diagonalizable in the case of spherical geometries and their eigenvalues are nonzero for all frequencies. Furthermore, we show that for spherical geometries one of the field-only integral formulations considered in this paper exhibits eigenvalues clustering at one—a property similar to second-kind integral equations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study discrepancy minimization for vectors in [math] under various settings. The main result is the analysis of a new simple random process in high dimensions through a comparison argument. As corollaries, we obtain bounds which are tight up to logarithmic factors for online vector balancing against oblivious adversaries, resolving several questions posed by Bansal et al. [STOC, ACM, New York, 2020, pp. 1139–1152], as well as a linear time algorithm for logarithmic bounds for the Komlós conjecture.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
All the existing entropy stable (ES) schemes for relativistic hydrodynamics (RHD) in the literature were restricted to the ideal equation of state (EOS), which however is often a poor approximation for most relativistic flows due to its inconsistency with the relativistic kinetic theory. This paper develops high-order ES finite difference schemes for RHD with general Synge-type EOS, which encompasses a range of special EOSs. We first establish an entropy pair for the RHD equations with general Synge-type EOS in any space dimensions. We rigorously prove that the found entropy function is strictly convex and derive the associated entropy variables, laying the foundation for designing entropy conservative (EC) and ES schemes. Due to relativistic effects, one cannot explicitly express primitive variables, fluxes, and entropy variables in terms of conservative variables. Consequently, this highly complicates the analysis of the entropy structure of the RHD equations, the investigation of entropy convexity, and the construction of EC numerical fluxes. By using a suitable set of parameter variables, we construct novel two-point EC fluxes in a unified form for general Synge-type EOS. We obtain high-order EC schemes through linear combinations of the two-point EC fluxes. Arbitrarily high-order accurate ES schemes are achieved by incorporating dissipation terms into the EC schemes, based on (weighted) essentially non-oscillatory reconstructions. Additionally, we derive the general dissipation matrix for general Synge-type EOS based on the scaled eigenvectors of the RHD system. We also define a suitable average of the dissipation matrix at the cell interfaces to ensure that the resulting ES schemes can resolve stationary contact discontinuities accurately. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our schemes for RHD with four special EOSs.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We analyze the propagation of two-dimensional dispersive and relativistic wavepackets localized in the vicinity of the zero level set [math] of a slowly varying domain wall modeling the interface separating two insulating media. We propose a semiclassical oscillatory representation of the propagating wavepackets and provide an estimate of their accuracy in appropriate energy norms. We describe the propagation of relativistic modes along [math] and analyze dispersive modes by a stationary phase method. In the absence of turning points, we show that arbitrary smooth localized initial conditions may be represented as a superposition of such wavepackets. In the presence of turning points, the results apply only for sufficiently high-frequency wavepackets. The theory finds applications for both Dirac systems of equations modeling topologically nontrivial systems as well as Klein–Gordon equations, which are topologically trivial.]]></summary>

This paper is concerned with the cavity scattering problem in an infinite thin plate, where the out-of-plane displacement is governed by the two-dimensional biharmonic wave equation. Based on an operator splitting, the scattering problem is recast into a coupled boundary value problem for the Helmholtz and modified Helmholtz equations. A novel boundary integral formulation is proposed for the coupled problem. By introducing an appropriate regularizer, the well-posedness is established for the system of boundary integral equations. Moreover, the convergence analysis is carried out for the semi- and full-discrete schemes of the boundary integral system by using the collocation method. Numerical results show that the proposed method is highly accurate for both smooth and nonsmooth examples.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We consider random wave coupling along a flat boundary in dimension three, where the coupling is between surface and body modes and is induced by scattering by a randomly heterogeneous medium. In an appropriate scaling regime we obtain a system of radiative transfer equations which are satisfied by the mean Wigner transform of the mode amplitudes. We provide a rigorous probabilistic framework for describing solutions to this system using that it has the form of a Kolmogorov equation for some Markov process. We then prove statistical stability of the smoothed Wigner transform under the Gaussian approximation. We conclude with analyzing the nonlinear inverse problem for the radiative transfer equations and establish the unique recovery of phase and group velocities as well as power spectral information for the medium fluctuations from the observed smoothed Wigner transform. The mentioned statistical stability is essential in monitoring applications where the realization of the random medium may change.]]></summary>
