 Abstract. We propose to adopt statistical regression as the projection operator to enable data-driven learning of the operators in the Mori–Zwanzig formalism. We present a principled method to extract the Markov and memory operators for any regression models. We show that the choice of linear regression results in a recently proposed data-driven learning algorithm based on Mori’s projection operator, which is a higher-order approximate Koopman learning method. We show that more expressive nonlinear regression models naturally fill in the gap between the highly idealized and computationally efficient Mori’s projection operator and the most optimal yet computationally infeasible Zwanzig’s projection operator. We performed numerical experiments and extracted the operators for an array of regression-based projections, including linear, polynomial, spline, and neural network–based regressions, showing a progressive improvement as the complexity of the regression model increased. Our proposition provides a general framework to extract memory-dependent corrections and can be readily applied to an array of data-driven learning methods for stationary dynamical systems in the literature.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We precisely and rigorously characterize the decay of elastic fields generated by dislocations in crystalline materials, focusing specifically on the role of multilattices. Concretely, we establish that the elastic field generated by a dislocation in a multilattice can be decomposed into a continuum field predicted by a linearized Cauchy–Born elasticity theory, and a discrete and nonlinear core corrector representing the defect core. We demonstrate both analytically and numerically the consequences of this result for cell size effects in numerical simulations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The generalized spectral theory is an effective approach to analyze a linear operator on a Hilbert space [math] with a continuous spectrum. The generalized spectrum is computed via analytic continuations of the resolvent operators using a dense locally convex subspace [math] of [math] and its dual space [math]. The three topological spaces [math] are called the rigged Hilbert space or the Gelfand triplet. In this paper, the generalized spectra of the Perron–Frobenius operators of the one-sided and two-sided shifts of finite type (symbolic dynamical systems) are determined. A one-sided subshift of finite type which is conjugate to the multiplication with the golden ratio on [math] modulo 1 is also considered. A new construction of the Gelfand triplet for the generalized spectrum of symbolic dynamical systems is proposed by means of an algebraic procedure. The asymptotic formula of the iteration of Perron–Frobenius operators is also given. The iteration converges to the mixing state whose rate of convergence is determined by the generalized spectrum.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We develop an algorithm for the equivariant divergence formula of the unstable perturbation of unstable transfer operators, by progressively computing [math] many bounded vectors or covectors on one orbit, where [math] is the unstable dimension. Combining this with the nonintrusive adjoint shadowing algorithm, we obtain the fast adjoint response algorithm for the linear responses on physical measures of discrete-time uniformly hyperbolic systems. The cost is independent of the number of parameters. We demonstrate our algorithm on a 21-dimensional chaotic system, a system with stochastic noise, and systems with discontinuities. Unlike previous methods, our algorithms are not cursed by dimensionality or the sensitive dependence on initial conditions.]]></summary>

This paper considers a deterministic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) networked bivirus epidemic model (termed the bivirus model for short), in which two competing viruses spread through a set of populations (nodes) connected by two graphs, which may be different if the two viruses have different transmission pathways. The networked dynamics can give rise to complex equilibria patterns, and most current results identify conditions on the model parameters for convergence to the healthy equilibrium (where both viruses are extinct) or a boundary equilibrium (where one virus is endemic and the other is extinct). However, there are only limited results on coexistence equilibria (where both viruses are endemic). This paper establishes a set of “counting” results which provide lower bounds on the number of coexistence equilibria and, perhaps more importantly, establish properties on the local stability/instability properties of these equilibria. In order to do this, we employ the Poincaré–Hopf theorem but with significant modifications to overcome several challenges arising from the bivirus system model, such as the fact that the system dynamics do not evolve on a manifold in the typical sense required to apply Poincaré–Hopf theory. Subsequently, Morse inequalities are used to tighten the counting results, under the reasonable assumption that the bivirus system is a Morse–Smale dynamical system. Numerical examples are provided which demonstrate the presence of multiple attractor equilibria and multiple coexistence equilibria.]]></summary>

We present a framework for the structure-preserving approximation of partial differential equations on mapped multipatch domains, extending the classical theory of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) to discrete de Rham sequences which are broken, i.e., fully discontinuous across the patch interfaces. Following the Conforming/Nonconforming Galerkin (CONGA) schemes developed in Campos Pinto and Sonnendrücker (Math Comput 85:2651–2685, 2016) and Campos Pinto and Güçlü (Broken-FEEC discretizations and Hodge Laplace problems. arXiv:2109.02553, 2022), our approach is based on: (i) the identification of a conforming discrete de Rham sequence with stable commuting projection operators, (ii) the relaxation of the continuity constraints between patches, and (iii) the construction of conforming projections mapping back to the conforming subspaces, allowing to define discrete differentials on the broken sequence. This framework combines the advantages of conforming FEEC discretizations (e.g. commuting projections, discrete duality and Hodge–Helmholtz decompositions) with the data locality and implementation simplicity of interior penalty methods for discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. We apply it to several initial- and boundary-value problems, as well as eigenvalue problems arising in electromagnetics. In each case our formulations are shown to be well posed thanks to an appropriate stabilization of the jumps across the interfaces, and the solutions are extremely robust with respect to the stabilization parameter. Finally we describe a construction using tensor-product splines on mapped cartesian patches, and we detail the associated matrix operators. Our numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and stability of this discrete framework, and they allow us to verify that expected structure-preserving properties such as divergence or harmonic constraints are respected to floating-point accuracy.]]></summary>

We present an efficient a posteriori error control strategy for an energy-based concurrent multiscale method with sharp interface in molecular mechanics, namely the geometric reconstruction based atomistic/continuum coupling method (GRAC). For the problem of the adaptive simulation of a range of crystal defects with practical importance, we develop an adaptive algorithm for the GRAC method based on a theory based modification of the residual based a posteriori error estimator and a specially designed mesh structure. In particular, by exploiting the decay of the displacement of the crystal caused by the defects, we are able to prove that the numerically expensive modeling residual estimator, which often exists in concurrent multiscale schemes, can be appropriately approximated by the inexpensive coarsening residual estimator in certain region which results in a significantly improvement of the efficiency of the adaptivity. The numerical experiments show that our adaptive strategy based on the modified error estimator and special mesh structure with properly chosen parameters leads to the same optimal convergence rate of the error but reduces the computational cost measured in CPU times by one order with respect to the number of degrees of freedom compared with that based on the original residual based error estimator.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Momentum space transformations for incommensurate two-dimensional electronic structure calculations are fundamental for reducing computational cost and for representing the data in a more physically motivating format, as exemplified in the Bistritzer–MacDonald model [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 108 (2011), pp. 12233–12237]. However, these transformations can be difficult to implement in more complex systems such as when mechanical relaxation patterns are present. In this work, we aim for two objectives. First, we strive to simplify the understanding and implementation of this transformation by rigorously writing the transformations between the four relevant spaces, which we denote real space, configuration space, momentum space, and reciprocal space. This provides a straightforward algorithm for writing the complex momentum space model from the original real space model. Second, we implement this for twisted bilayer graphene with mechanical relaxation effects included. We also analyze the convergence rates of the approximations and show the tight-binding coupling range increases for smaller relative twists between layers, demonstrating that the 3-nearest neighbor coupling of the Bistritzer–MacDonald model is insufficient when mechanical relaxation is included for very small angles. We quantify this and verify with numerical simulation.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Motivated by the control of complex microbiota for reducing infection by a pathogenic agent, we introduce the theoretical framework from optimal control to analyze this problem. Two complementary approaches can be applied in the analysis: one is the so-called permanent case, where no digital constraints are concerned with the control (taken as a measurable mapping); the other is the sampled-data control case taking into account the logistic constraints, e.g., frequency of the medical interventions. The model is the n-dimensional Lotka–Volterra equation controlled using either probiotics or antibiotic agents or a combination of transplantation and bactericides. In this article, we concentrate on the permanent case associated to the probiotic or antibiotic agent. The maximum principle is used to parameterize the geodesics, and the optimal synthesis boils down to analyzing mainly the singular trajectories and their concatenation with bang arcs.]]></summary>

We present an hp-adaptive discretization for a sharp interface model with a level-set ghost-fluid method to simulate compressible multiphase flows. The scheme applies an efficient p-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin (DG) operator in regions of smooth flow. Shocks and the phase interface are captured by a Finite Volume (FV) scheme on a h-refined element-local sub-grid. The resulting hp-adaptive scheme thus combines both the high order accuracy of the DG method and the robustness of the FV scheme by using p-adaptation in smooth areas and h-refinement at discontinuities, respectively. For the level-set based interface tracking, a similar hybrid DG/FV operator is employed. Both p-refinement and FV shock and interface capturing are performed at runtime and controlled by an indicator, which is based on the modal decay of the solution polynomials. In parallel simulations, the hp-adaptive discretization together with the costly interface tracking algorithm cause a significant imbalance in the processor workloads. To ensure parallel efficiency, we propose a dynamic load balancing scheme that determines the workload distribution by element-local wall time measurements and redistributes elements along a space filling curve. The parallelization strategy is supported by strong scaling tests using up to 8192 cores. The framework is applied to established benchmarks problems for inviscid, compressible multiphase flows. The results demonstrate that the hybrid adaptive discretization can efficiently and accurately handle complex multiphase flow problems involving pronounced interface deformations and merging interface contours.]]></summary>

 Abstract. High entropy alloys (HEAs) are a class of novel materials that exhibit superb engineering properties. It has been demonstrated by extensive experiments and first principles/atomistic simulations that short-range order in the atomic level randomness strongly influences the properties of HEAs. In this paper, we derive stochastic continuum models for HEAs with short-range order from atomistic models. A proper continuum limit is obtained such that the mean and variance of the atomic level randomness together with the short-range order described by a characteristic length are kept in the process from the atomistic interaction model to the continuum equation. The obtained continuum model with short-range order is in the form of an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process. This validates the continuum model based on the OU process adopted phenomenologically by Zhang et al. [Acta Mater., 166 (2019), pp. 424–434] for HEAs with short-range order. We derive such stochastic continuum models with short-range order for both (i) the elastic deformation in HEAs without defects and (ii) HEAs with dislocations (line defects).

 Abstract. A wide variety of stationary or moving spatially localized structures is present in evolution problems on unbounded domains, governed by higher-than-second-order reversible spatial interactions. This work provides a generic unfolding in one spatial dimension of a certain codimension-three singularity that explains the organization of bifurcation diagrams of such localized states in a variety of contexts, ranging from nonlinear optics to fluid mechanics, mathematical biology, and beyond. The singularity occurs when a cusp bifurcation associated with the onset of bistability between homogeneous steady states encounters a pattern-forming, or Turing, bifurcation. The latter corresponds to a Hamiltonian-Hopf point of the corresponding spatial dynamics problem. Such codimension-three points are sometimes called Lifshitz points in the physics literature. In the simplest case where the spatial system conserves a first integral, the system is described by a canonical fourth-order scalar system. The problem contains three small parameters: two that unfold the cusp bifurcation and one that unfolds the Turing bifurcation. Several cases are revealed, depending on open conditions on the signs of the lowest-order nonlinear terms. Taking the case in which the Turing bifurcation is subcritical, various parameter regimes are considered and the bifurcation diagrams of localized structures are elucidated. A rich bifurcation structure is revealed which involves transitions between regions of localized periodic patterns generated by standard homoclinic snaking, and regions of stationary domains of one homogeneous solution embedded in the other organized in a collapsed snaking structure. The theory is shown to unify previous numerical results obtained in models arising in nonlinear optics, fluid mechanics, and excitable media more generally.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A function with finite asymptotic limits gives rise to a transition equation between a “past system” and a “future system.” This question is analyzed in the case of nonautonomous coercive nonlinear scalar ordinary differential equations with concave derivative with respect to the state variable. The fundamental hypothesis is the existence of three hyperbolic solutions for the limit systems, in which case the upper and lower ones are attractive. All the global dynamical possibilities are described in terms of the internal dynamics of the pullback attractor: cases of tracking of the two hyperbolic attractive solutions or lack of it (tipping) may arise. This analysis, made in the language of processes and also in terms of the skewproduct formulation of the problem, includes cases of rate-induced critical transitions, as well as cases of phase-induced and size-induced tipping. The conclusions are applied in models of mathematical biology and population dynamics. Rate-induced tracking phenomena causing extinction of a native species or invasion of a nonnative one are described, as well as population models affected by a Holling type III functional response to predation where tipping due to the changes in the size of the transition may occur. In all these cases, the appearance of a critical transition can be understood as a consequence of the strength of the Allee effect.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
We study numerical algorithms for solving Biot’s model. Based on a three-field reformulation, we present some algorithms that are inspired by the work of Chaabane et al. (Comput Math Appl 75(7):2328–2337) and Lee (Unconditionally stable second order convergent partitioned methods for multiple-network poroelasticity arXiv:1901.06078, 2019) for decoupling the computation of Biot’s model. A new theoretical framework is developed to analyze the algorithms. Considering a uniform temporal discretization, these algorithms solve the coupled model on the first time level. On the remaining time levels, one algorithm solves a reaction-diffusion subproblem first and then solves a generalized Stokes subproblem. Another algorithm reverses the order of solving the two subproblems. Our algorithms manage to decouple the numerical computation of the coupled system while retaining the convergence properties of the original coupled algorithm. Theoretical analysis is conducted to show that these algorithms are unconditionally stable and optimally convergent. Numerical experiments are also carried out to validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithms.]]></summary>

Seismic data is contaminated by noise due to a variety of factors including wind, ocean currents, vehicular traffic, and construction. Further receiver malfunction and limitations in acquisition geometry may lead to missing data. Seismic data naturally contains redundancies because surveys repeatedly sample the same region of the subsurface. If this data is organized into a high-dimensional data structure (a tensor), then the incomplete noisy data will have higher rank than the ground truth data. Direct rank reduction for tensors is an NP-hard problem. Thus one instead minimizes an approximation to rank such as the tensor nuclear norm (TNN), which sums the tensor’s singular values. This TNN model together with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization method is denoted TNN-ADMM. While convergence of ADMM has been shown previously for general minimization of functions, here we formulate tensor properties which allow us to prove a sufficient condition: by bounding the step size to be greater than one, the Lagrangian function is strictly decreasing and bounded. Therefore, ADMM applied to the TNN model converges. This condition reduces the computational burden of tuning the step size parameter. We demonstrate the performance of denoising and reconstruction on two synthetic seismic datasets and on a real dataset from offshore Western Australia. In the case of the linear synthetic data, TNN-ADMM out-performs another popular method by giving four times less error in half the computational time. We also illustrate that TNN-ADMM can effectively remove the majority of artificially added noise to real data.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Recent work by public health experts suggests that incorporating human behavior is crucial in faithfully modeling an epidemic. We present a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation SIR-type population model for an epidemic including behavioral concerns. In our model, the disease spreads via mass action, as is customary in compartmental models. However, drawing from social contagion theory, we assume that as the disease spreads and prevention measures are enacted, noncompliance with prevention measures also spreads throughout the population. We prove global existence of classical solutions of our model, and then perform [math]-type analysis and determine asymptotic behavior of the model in different parameter regimes. Finally, we simulate the model and discuss the new facets which distinguish our model from basic SIR-type models.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In the dynamic minimum set cover problem, the challenge is to minimize the update time while guaranteeing a close-to-optimal [math] approximation factor. (Throughout, [math], [math], [math], and [math] are parameters denoting the maximum number of elements, the number of sets, the frequency, and the cost range.) In the high-frequency range, when [math], this was achieved by a deterministic [math]-approximation algorithm with [math] amortized update time by Gupta et al. [Online and dynamic algorithms for set cover, in Proceedings STOC 2017, ACM, pp. 537–550]. In this paper we consider the low-frequency range, when [math], and obtain deterministic algorithms with a [math]-approximation ratio and the foll…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Balanced truncation is a well-established model order reduction method which has been applied to a variety of problems. Recently, a connection between linear Gaussian Bayesian inference problems and the system-theoretic concept of balanced truncation has been drawn (Qian et al in Sci Comput 91:29, 2022). Although this connection is new, the application of balanced truncation to data assimilation is not a novel idea: it has already been used in four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var). This paper discusses the application of balanced truncation to linear Gaussian Bayesian inference, and, in particular, the 4D-Var method, thereby strengthening the link between systems theory and data assimilation further. Similarities between both types of data assimilation problems enable a generalisation of the state-of-the-art approach to the use of arbitrary prior covariances as reachability Gramians. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced approach using time-limited balanced truncation that allows to balance Bayesian inference for unstable systems and in addition improves the numerical results for short observation periods.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We create a novel connection between Boltzmann sampling methods and Devroye’s algorithm to develop highly efficient sampling procedures that generate objects from important combinatorial classes with a given size [math] in expected time [math]. This performance is best possible and significantly improves the state of the art for samplers of subcritical graph classes (such as cactus graphs, outerplanar graphs, and series-parallel graphs), subcritical substitution-closed classes of permutations, Bienaymé–Galton–Watson trees conditioned on their number of leaves, and several further examples. Our approach allows for this high level of universality, as it applies in general to classes admitting bijective encodings by so-called enriched trees, which are rooted trees with additional structures on the offspring of each node.]]></summary>

The solution of nonlinear inverse problems is a challenging task in numerical analysis. In most cases, this kind of problems is solved by iterative procedures that, at each iteration, linearize the problem in a neighborhood of the currently available approximation of the solution. The linearized problem is then solved by a direct or iterative method. Among this class of solution methods, the Gauss–Newton method is one of the most popular ones. We propose an efficient implementation of this method for large-scale problems. Our implementation is based on projecting the nonlinear problem into a sequence of nested subspaces, referred to as Generalized Krylov Subspaces, whose dimension increases with the number of iterations, except for when restarts are carried out. When the computation of the Jacobian matrix is expensive, we combine our iterative method with secant (Broyden) updates to further reduce the computational cost. We show convergence of the proposed solution methods and provide a few numerical examples that illustrate their performance.]]></summary>

In this work, we theoretically and numerically discuss a class of time fractional normal-subdiffusion transport equation, which depicts a crossover from normal diffusion (as 
                      
                      \(t\rightarrow 0\)
                      
                    ) to sub-diffusion (as 
                      
                      \(t\rightarrow \infty \)
                      
                    ). Firstly, the well-posedness and regularities of the model are studied by using the bivariate Mittag-Leffler function. Theoretical results show that after introducing the first-order derivative operator, the regularity of the solution can be improved in substance. Then, a numerical scheme with high-precision is developed no matter the initial value is smooth or non-smooth. More specifically, we use the contour integral method (CIM) with parameterized hyperbolic contour to approximate the temporal local and non-local operators, and employ the standard Galerkin finite element method for spatial discretization. Rigorous error estimates show that the proposed numerical scheme has spectral accuracy in time and optimal convergence order in space. Besides, we further improve the algorithm and reduce the computational cost by using the barycentric Lagrange interpolation. Finally, the obtained theoretical results as well as the acceleration algorithm are verified by several 1-D and 2-D numerical experiments, which also show that the numerical scheme developed in this paper is effective and robust.]]></summary>
