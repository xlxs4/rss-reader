        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Many large-scale optimization problems can be expressed as composite optimization models. Accelerated first-order methods such as the fast iterative shrinkage–thresholding algorithm (FISTA) have proven effective for numerous large composite models. In this paper, we present a new variation of FISTA, to be called C-FISTA, which obtains global linear convergence for a broader class of composite models than many of the latest FISTA variants. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of C-FISTA through multiple numerical experiments on group Lasso, group logistic regression and geometric programming models. Furthermore, we utilize Fenchel duality to show C-FISTA can solve the dual of a finite sum convex optimization model.]]></summary>

In this paper, we analyze the hybridized, embedded-hybridized and embedded discontinuous Galerkin methods for the Stokes equations with Dirac measures. The velocity, the velocity traces and the pressure traces are approximated by polynomials of degree 
                      
                      \(k\ge 1\)
                      
                    , and the pressure is discretized by polynomials of degree 
                      
                      \(k-1\)
                      
                    . An attractive property, named divergence-free, is satisfied by the discrete velocity field. Moreover, the discrete velocity fields derived by hybridized and embedded-hybridized discontinuous Galerkin methods are H(div)-conforming. Using duality argument and Oswald interpolation, a priori and a posteriori error estimates are obtained for the velocity in

A solution technique is proposed for flows in porous media that guarantees local conservation of mass. We first compute a flux field to balance the mass source and then exploit exact co-chain complexes to generate a solenoidal correction. A reduced basis method based on proper orthogonal decomposition is employed to construct the correction and we show that mass balance is ensured regardless of the quality of the reduced basis approximation. The method is directly applicable to mixed finite and virtual element methods, among other structure-preserving discretization techniques, and we present the extension to Darcy flow in fractured porous media.]]></summary>

 Abstract. One of the most important problems arising in time series analysis is that of classifying the states of a dynamical system. That is, given a collection of time series, is it possible to perform two-state classification (chaotic versus periodic) of the underlying system? For this task, we turn to the field of topological data analysis, which encodes information about the shape and structure of data. In this paper, we investigate a more recent method for encoding the structure of the attractor as a weighted graph, known as the ordinal partition network, representing information about when the dynamical system has passed between certain regions of state space. We provide methods to incorporate the weighting information and show that this framework provides more resilience to noise or perturbations in the system as well as improving the accuracy of dynamic state identification.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We present a mean-field formalism for modeling firing-rate statistics of brain regions whose neurons exhibit atypical firing patterns and heterogeneous electrophysiological properties. We apply the formalism to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)—the human circadian pacemaker—whose neurons can intrinsically exhibit depolarized low-amplitude membrane oscillations (DLAMOs), depolarization block (DB), and standard action potential firing at different times of day. Further, gamma-aminobutyric acid reversal potentials and molecular circadian phases of SCN neurons, among other properties, vary across the network and/or slowly over time. Our formalism consists of a system of integro-differential equations describing the time evolution of the mean and standard deviation of synaptic conductances across the network. Electrophysiological properties of SCN neurons are incorporated by computing responses to synaptic conductance inputs of a Hodgkin–Huxley-type SCN neuron model that exhibits DLAMOs and DB. Such responses are then averaged over distributions of relevant quantities and included in the differential equations. Results suggest mechanisms by which physiologically relevant changes to firing activities may arise, highlighting means by which the amplitude of firing rates may shrink, the standard deviation of firing rates may grow, and by which a mid-day dip in firing rates may appear. For instance, results show that a large spread in circadian phases across SCN neurons reduces the size of oscillations in SCN network firing activity across the 24-hour day, identifying a mechanism by which heterogeneities in neuron electrophysiology could influence circadian rhythms.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, a two-scale approach for elastic shape optimization of fine-scale structures in additive manufacturing is investigated. To this end, a free material optimization is performed on the macro-scale using elasticity tensors in a set of microscopically realizable tensors. A database of these realizable tensors and their cost values is obtained with a shape and topology optimization on microscopic cells, working within a fixed set of elasticity tensors samples. This microscopic optimization takes into account manufacturability constraints via predefined material bridges to neighboring cells at the faces of the microscopic fundamental cell. For the actual additive manufacturing on a chosen fine-scale, a piecewise constant elasticity tensor ansatz on grid cells of a macroscopic mesh is applied. The macroscopic optimization is performed in an efficient online phase, whereas the associated cellwise optimal material patterns are retrieved from the database that was computed offline. For that, the set of admissible realizable elasticity tensors is parametrized using tensor product cubic B-splines over the unit square matching the precomputed samples. This representation is then efficiently used in an interior point method for the free material optimization on the macro-scale.]]></summary>

 Abstract. When waves propagate through a complex medium like the turbulent atmosphere the wave field becomes incoherent and the wave intensity forms a complex speckle pattern. In this paper we study a speckle memory effect in the frequency domain and some of its consequences. This effect means that certain properties of the speckle pattern produced by wave transmission through a randomly scattering medium is preserved when shifting the frequency of the illumination. The speckle memory effect is characterized via a detailed novel analysis of the fourth-order moment of the random paraxial Green’s function at four different frequencies. We arrive at a precise characterization of the frequency memory effect and what governs the strength of the memory. As an application we quantify the statistical stability of time-reversal wave refocusing through a randomly scattering medium in the paraxial or beam regime. Time reversal refers to the situation when a transmitted wave field is recorded on a time-reversal mirror then time reversed and sent back into the complex medium. The re-emitted wave field then refocuses at the original source point. We compute the mean of the refocused wave and identify a novel quantitative description of its variance in terms of the radius of the time-reversal mirror, the size of its elements, the source bandwidth, and the statistics of the random medium fluctuations.]]></summary>

A least squares semi-supervised local clustering algorithm based on the idea of compressed sensing is proposed to extract clusters from a graph with known adjacency matrix. The algorithm is based on a two-stage approach similar to the one proposed by Lai and Mckenzie (SIAM J Math Data Sci 2:368–395, 2020). However, under a weaker assumption and with less computational complexity, our algorithms are shown to be able to find a desired cluster with high probability. The “one cluster at a time" feature of our method distinguishes it from other global clustering methods. Numerical experiments are conducted on the synthetic data such as stochastic block model and real data such as MNIST, political blogs network, AT &T and YaleB human faces data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.]]></summary>

Relaxation Runge–Kutta methods reproduce a fully discrete dissipation (or conservation) of entropy for entropy stable semi-discretizations of nonlinear conservation laws. In this paper we derive the discrete adjoint of relaxation Runge–Kutta schemes, which are applicable to discretize-then-optimize approaches for optimal control problems. Furthermore, we prove that the derived discrete relaxation Runge–Kutta adjoint preserves time-symmetry when applied to linear skew-symmetric systems of ODEs. Numerical experiments verify these theoretical results while demonstrating the importance of appropriately treating the relaxation parameter when computing the discrete adjoint.]]></summary>

An interface/boundary-unfitted eXtended hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (X-HDG) method of arbitrary order is proposed for linear elasticity interface problems on unfitted meshes with respect to the interface and domain boundary.

In this paper, a spectral Petrov–Galerkin method is developed to solve an optimal control problem governed by a two-sided space-fractional diffusion-reaction equation with additive fractional noise. In order to compensate weak singularities of the solution near boundaries, regularities of both the fractional noise and the optimal control problem are analyzed in weighted Sobolev space. The spectral Petrov–Galerkin method is presented by employing truncated spectral expansion of the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) type noise, and error estimates are given based on the obtained regularity of the optimal control problem. Numerical experiments are carried out to verify the theoretical findings.]]></summary>

The primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm is popular in solving min-max problems which are being widely used in a variety of areas. To improve the applicability and efficiency of PDHG for different application scenarios, we focus on the preconditioned PDHG (PrePDHG) algorithm, which is a framework covering PDHG, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and other methods. We give the optimal convergence condition of PrePDHG in the sense that the key parameters in the condition can not be further improved, which fills the theoretical gap in the-state-of-art convergence results of PrePDHG, and obtain the ergodic and non-ergodic sublinear convergence rates of PrePDHG. The theoretical analysis is achieved by establishing the equivalence between PrePDHG and indefinite proximal ADMM. Besides, we discuss various choices of the proximal matrices in PrePDHG and derive some interesting results. For example, the convergence condition of diagonal PrePDHG is improved to be tight, the dual stepsize of the balanced augmented Lagrangian method can be enlarged to 4/3 from 1, and a balanced augmented Lagrangian method with symmetric Gauss-Seidel iterations is also explored. Numerical results on the matrix game, projection onto the Birkhoff polytope, earth mover’s distance, and CT reconstruction verify the effectiveness and superiority of PrePDHG.]]></summary>

In this paper we develop a neural network for the numerical simulation of time-dependent linear transport equations with diffusive scaling and uncertainties. The goal of the network is to resolve the computational challenges of curse-of-dimensionality and multiple scales of the problem. We first show that a standard Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) fails to capture the multiscale nature of the problem, hence justifies the need to use Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Networks (APNNs). We show that not all classical AP formulations are directly fit for the neural network approach. We construct a micro-macro decomposition based neural network, and also build in a mass conservation mechanism into the loss function, in order to capture the dynamic and multiscale nature of the solutions. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this APNNs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
We consider the numerical solution of Poisson’s equation on structured grids using geometric multigrid with nonstandard coarse grids and coarse-level operators. We are motivated by the problem of developing high-order accurate numerical solvers for elliptic boundary value problems on complex geometry using overset grids. For flexibility in grid generation, we would like to consider lower-order accurate coarse-level approximations, and coarsening factors other than two. We show that second-order accurate coarse-level approximations are very effective for fourth- or sixth-order accurate fine-level finite-difference discretizations. We study the use of different Galerkin and non-Galerkin coarse-level operators. Using local Fourier analysis (LFA) we choose the smoothing parameter 
                      
                      \(\omega \)
                      
                     and the coarse-level operators to optimize the overall multigrid convergence rate. We show that the results based on LFA for periodic problems also hold for more general boundary conditions provided these are discretized using compatibility conditions. Numerical results for Poisson’s equation on a sample overset grid show that our multigrid solver is many times faster, and uses less memory, than selected Krylov solvers and an algebraic multigrid solver. We also study grid coarsening by a general factor and show that good convergence rates are retained for a range of coarsening factors around two. We ask the question of which coarsening factor leads to the most efficient multigrid algorithm.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We present a data-driven point of view for rare events, which represent conformational transitions in biochemical reactions modeled by overdamped Langevin dynamics on manifolds in high dimensions. We first reinterpret the transition state theory and the transition path theory from the optimal control viewpoint. Given a point cloud probing the manifold, we construct a discrete Markov chain with a [math]-matrix computed from an approximated Voronoi tesselation via the point cloud. We use this [math]-matrix to compute a discrete committor function whose level set automatically orders the point cloud. Then based on the committor function, an optimally controlled random walk on point clouds is constructed and utilized to efficiently sample transition paths, which become an almost sure event in [math] time instead of a rare event in the original reaction dynamics. To compute the mean transition path efficiently, a local averaging algorithm based on the optimally controlled random walk is developed, which adapts the finite temperature string method to the controlled Monte Carlo samples. Numerical examples on sphere/torus including a conformational transition for the alanine dipeptide in vacuum are conducted to illustrate the data-driven solver for the transition path theory on point clouds. The mean transition path obtained via the controlled Monte Carlo simulations highly coincides with the computed dominant transition path in the transition path theory.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the homogenized energy densities of periodic ferromagnetic Ising systems. We prove that, for finite range interactions, the homogenized energy density, identifying the effective limit, is crystalline, i.e., its Wulff crystal is a polytope, for which we can (exponentially) bound the number of vertices. This is achieved by deriving a dual representation of the energy density through a finite cell formula. This formula also permits easy numerical computations: we show a few experiments where we compute periodic patterns which minimize the anisotropy of the surface tension.]]></summary>

This paper addresses a simple energy-based overset finite element method (EbO-FEM) to solve pseudo-static deformation problems consisting of overlapped meshes based on the domain composition method (DCM). This scheme is a non-iterative equation-based method for enforcing the continuity of the displacement field. Hence, the scheme consumes possible minimal computational costs for deformation problems with non-conforming overlapping meshes. The system’s total energy is augmented with continuity constraint energy (CCE) which is a function of the gaps in the displacement field between two overlapping regions. Subsequently, two conventional integration schemes, the Gauss-point projection, and the point-to-point projection, are utilized to discretize the CCE. It is confirmed that both schemes can yield accurate and unique solutions in the overlapped region of the finite element meshes. Further, we proposed a dimensionless relative penalty parameter (DRP). We found that DRP ranging between 1 to 10 is appropriate to robustly obtain accurate solutions for a wide range of scales, stiffness, and geometries, which is supported by three numerical simulations without increasing computational costs after assembling the global matrices and vectors.]]></summary>

We present the first implementation of the Active Flux method on adaptively refined Cartesian grids. The Active Flux method is a third order accurate finite volume method for hyperbolic conservation laws, which is based on the use of point values as well as cell average values of the conserved quantities. The resulting method has a compact stencil in space and time and good stability properties. The method is implemented as a new solver in ForestClaw, a software for parallel adaptive mesh refinement of patch-based solvers. On each Cartesian grid patch the single grid Active Flux method can be applied. The exchange of data between grid patches is organised via ghost cells. The local stencil in space and time and the availability of the point values that are used for the reconstruction, leads to an efficient implementation. The resulting method is third order accurate, conservative and allows the use of subcycling in time.]]></summary>

Upon these results, we propose a practical way to design high-order SSPM schemes for FBSDEs. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the strong stability of our SSPM schemes.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The goal of this work is to introduce a new online data driven modeling solution for tracking the dynamics of systems, the behavior of which is governed by (nonlinear) partial differential equations (PDEs). In order to reach this goal, this paper introduces a recursive algorithm for black box time varying model identification along with an online algorithm for reducing the order of the identified model. The resulting system model is a linear time varying low order state space representation usable, e.g., for controller design or prediction. The model reduction step relies on the recursive determination of the orthonormal basis of a specific data based proper orthogonal decomposition. The system identification procedure is initialized with the dynamic mode decomposition with control and updated recursively via the introduction of a specific recursive least squares algorithm. In both steps, a forgetting factor is used to focus on the most recent variations of the system. As case studies, a linear heat diffusion equation with a time varying diffusion parameter is first considered. The Burgers equation, a nonlinear hyperbolic PDE, is then utilized to assess the introduced methods applicability with nonlinear systems. Identification results based on simulation show the high accuracy of this new approach.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper presents a framework to perform bifurcation analysis in laboratory experiments or simulations. We employ control-based continuation to study the dynamics of a macroscopic variable of a microscopically defined model, exploring the potential viability of the underlying feedback control techniques in an experiment. In contrast to previous experimental studies that used iterative root-finding methods on the feedback control targets, we propose a feedback control law that is inherently noninvasive. That is, the control discovers the location of equilibria and stabilizes them simultaneously. We call the proposed control zero-in-equilibrium feedback control and we prove that it is able to stabilize branches of equilibria, except at singularities of codimension [math], where [math] is the number of state space dimensions the feedback can depend on. We apply the method to a simulated evacuation scenario where pedestrians have to reach an exit after maneuvering left or right around an obstacle. The scenario shows a hysteresis phenomenon with bistability and tipping between two possible steady pedestrian flows in microscopic simulations. We demonstrate for the evacuation scenario that the proposed control law is able to uniformly discover and stabilize steady flows along the entire branch, including points where other noninvasive approaches to feedback control become singular.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the paraxial wave equation with a randomly perturbed index of refraction, which can model the propagation of a wave beam in a turbulent medium. The random perturbation is a stationary and isotropic process with a general form of the covariance that may or may not be integrable. We focus attention mostly on the nonintegrable case, which corresponds to a random perturbation with long-range correlations, that is, relevant for propagation through a cloudy turbulent atmosphere. The analysis is carried out in a high-frequency regime where the forward scattering approximation holds. It reveals that the randomization of the wave field is multiscale: The travel time of the wave front is randomized at short distances of propagation, and it can be described by a fractional Brownian motion. The wave field observed in the random travel time frame is affected by the random perturbations at long distances, and it is described by a Schrödinger-type equation driven by a standard Brownian field. We use these results to quantify how scattering leads to decorrelation of the spatial and spectral components of the wave field and to a deformation of the pulse emitted by the source. These are important questions for applications, such as imaging and free space communications with pulsed laser beams through a turbulent atmosphere. We also compare the results with those used in the optics literature, which are based on the Kolmogorov model of turbulence. We show explicitly that the commonly used approximations for the decorrelation of spatial and spectral components are appropriate for the Kolmogorov model but fail for models with long-range correlations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Traveling waves propagating on a taut cable resting on an elastic substrate are investigated by an equivalent mechanical model based on the classical Klein–Gordon equation. The formulation is devised for an elastic response of generally arbitrary shape, and permits one to compute the propagation wave velocity without solving the equation of motion, thus providing a unified theoretical framework for a large class of response functions, linear or nonlinear, smooth or nonsmooth. The general solution is then applied to the cases of a general polynomial substrate, a bilinear substrate, a bilinear substrate with a cubic correction, and a negative linear stiffness substrate, all of them falling within the realm of nonsmooth systems when a piecewise continuous stiffness is chosen; in the second one, we recover results present in the literature and obtained by employing a method based on matching conditions, which are spared in the approach used in this paper. Finally, the application to the sine-Gordon equation is considered.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We propose a new algorithm for Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problems (PCSPs). It is a combination of the Constraint Basic LP relaxation and the Affine IP relaxation (CLAP). We give a characterization of the power of CLAP in terms of a minion homomorphism. Using this characterization, we identify a certain weak notion of symmetry which, if satisfied by infinitely many polymorphisms of PCSPs, guarantees tractability. We demonstrate that there are PCSPs solved by CLAP that are not solved by any of the existing algorithms for PCSPs; in particular, not by the [math] algorithm of Brakensiek et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 49 (2020), pp. 1232--1248] and not by a reduction to tractable finite-domain CSPs.]]></summary>
