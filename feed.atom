Getting an efficient neural network can be a very difficult task for engineers and researchers because of the huge number of hyperparameters to tune and their interconnections. To make the tuning step easier and more understandable, this work focuses on probably one of the most important leverage to improve Neural Networks efficiency: the optimizer. These recent years, a great number of algorithms have been developed but they need an accurate tuning to be efficient. To get rid of this long and experimental step, we are looking for generic and desirable properties for non-convex optimization. For this purpose, the optimizers are reinterpreted or analyzed as a discretization of a continuous dynamical system. This continuous framework offers many mathematical tools in order to interpret the sensitivity of the optimizer with respect to the initial guess such as Lyapunov stability. By enforcing the discrete decrease of Lyapunov functionals, new robust and efficient optimizers are designed. They also considerably simplify the tuning of hyperparameters (learning rate, momentum etc.). These Lyapunov based algorithms outperform several state of the art optimizers on different benchmarks of the literature. Drawing its inspiration from the numerical analysis of PDEs, this paper emphasizes the essential role of some hidden energy/entropy quantities for machine learning tasks.]]></summary>

 Abstract. At the macroscopic scale, many important models of collective motion fall into the class of kinematic flows for which both velocity and diffusion terms depend only on particle density. When total particle numbers are fixed and finite, simulations of corresponding microscopic dynamics exhibit stochastic effects which can induce a variety of interesting behaviors not present in the large system limit. In this article we undertake a systematic examination of finite-size fluctuations in a general class of particle models whose statistics correspond to those of stochastic kinematic flows. Doing so, we are able to characterize phenomena including quasi-jams in models of traffic flow; stochastic pattern formation among spatially coupled oscillators; anomalous bulk subdiffusion in porous media; and travelling wave fluctuations in a model of bacterial swarming.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The chase procedure is a fundamental algorithmic tool in database theory with a variety of applications. A central problem concerning the chase procedure is uniform (a.k.a. all-instances) chase termination: for a given set of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs), is it the case that the chase terminates for every input database? In view of the fact that this problem is, in general, undecidable, it is natural to ask whether known well-behaved classes of TGDs ensure decidability. We focus on the main paradigms that led to robust TGD-based formalisms, namely guardedness and stickiness, that have been introduced in the context of knowledge-enriched databases. Although uniform chase termination is well understood for the oblivious version of the chase (2EXPTIME-complete for guarded, and PSPACE-complete for sticky TGDs), the more subtle case of the restricted (a.k.a. the standard) chase is rather unexplored. We show that uniform restricted chase termination under guarded single-head TGDs and sticky single-head TGDs is decidable in elementary time. In the case of guardedness, we provide a reduction to the satisfiability problem of monadic second-order logic over infinite trees of bounded degree, while for stickiness we provide a reduction to the emptiness problem of deterministic Büchi automata. Those reductions build on a series of technical results of independent interest related to the notion of fairness of the restricted chase, and the existence of critical databases that characterize nontermination of the restricted chase via databases of a certain form.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper we take a combinatorial approach to the problem of list-decoding, which allows us to determine the precise relation (up to the exact constant) between the decoding radius, list size, and code rate. We prove a generalized Singleton bound for a given list size, and conjecture that the bound is tight for most Reed–Solomon (RS) codes over large enough finite fields. We also show that the conjecture holds true for list sizes 2 and 3, and as a by product show that most RS codes with a rate of at least 1/9 are list-decodable beyond the Johnson radius. Last, we give the first explicit construction in the literature of such RS codes. The main tools used in the proof are a new type of linear dependency between codewords of a code that are contained in a small Hamming ball, and a surprising connection between list-decoding and the notion of cycle space in graph theory. Both of them are new, and may be of independent interest.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The basic goal of survivable network design is to build a cheap network that maintains the connectivity between given sets of nodes despite the failure of a few edges/nodes. The connectivity augmentation problem ([math]) is arguably one of the most basic problems in this area: given a [math](-edge)-connected graph [math] and a set of extra edges (links), select a minimum cardinality subset [math] of links such that adding [math] to [math] increases its edge connectivity to [math]. Intuitively, one wants to make an existing network more reliable by augmenting it with extra edges. The best known approximation factor for this NP-hard problem is 2, and this can be achieved with multiple approaches (the first su…]]></summary>

An extended range of energy stable flux reconstruction schemes, developed using a summation-by-parts approach, is presented on quadrilateral elements for various sets of polynomial bases. For the maximal order bases, a new set of correction functions which result in stable schemes is found. However, for a range of orders it is shown that only a single correction function can be cast as a tensor-product. Subsequently, correction functions are identified using a generalised analytic framework that results in stable schemes for total order and approximate Euclidean order polynomial bases on quadrilaterals—which have not previously been explored in the context of flux reconstruction. It is shown that the approximate Euclidean order basis can provide similar numerical accuracy as the maximal order basis but with fewer points per element, and thus lower cost.]]></summary>

The aim of this work is to apply a semi-implicit (SI) strategy in an implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge–Kutta (RK) setting introduced in Boscarino et al. (J Sci Comput 68:975–1001, 2016) to a sequence of 1D time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) with high order spatial derivatives. This strategy gives a great flexibility to treat these equations, and allows the construction of simple linearly implicit schemes without any Newton’s iteration. Furthermore, the SI IMEX-RK schemes so designed does not need any severe time step restriction that usually one has using explicit methods for the stability, i.e. 
                      
                      \(\Delta t = {\mathcal {O}}(\Delta t^k)\)

                    ) order PDEs. For the space discretization, this strategy is combined with finite difference schemes. We illustrate the effectiveness of the schemes with many applications to dissipative, dispersive and biharmonic-type equations. Numerical experiments show that the proposed schemes are stable and can achieve optimal orders of accuracy.]]></summary>

Super- and sub-diffusions are two typical types of anomalous diffusions in the natural world. In this work, we discuss the numerical scheme for the model describing the competition between super- and sub-diffusions driven by fractional Brownian sheet noise. Based on the obtained regularization result of the solution by using the properties of Mittag–Leffler function and the regularized noise by Wong–Zakai approximation, we make full use of the regularity of the solution operators to achieve optimal convergence of the regularized solution. The spectral Galerkin method and the Mittag–Leffler Euler integrator are respectively used to deal with the space and time operators. In particular, by contour integral, the fast evaluation of the Mittag–Leffler Euler integrator is realized. We provide complete error analyses, which are verified by the numerical experiments.]]></summary>

In the current research, we analyze dissipation and dispersion characteristics of the most accurate two and three-stage Gauss–Legendre implicit Runge–Kutta (R-K) methods. These methods, known for their A-stability and high stage order, are observed to carry minimum dissipation error along with the highest possible dispersive order in their respective classes. Investigation reveals that these schemes are inherently optimized to carry low phase error only at small wavenumber. It is noticed that a unique scheme, although usually sought, might not be best across diverse temporal step sizes. As larger temporal step size is imperative in conjunction with implicit R-K methods for physical problems, we thoroughly investigate to derive a class of minimum dissipation and optimally low dispersion implicit R-K schemes. Schemes are obtained by cutting down amplification error and maximum reduction of weighted phase error, suggest better accuracy for relatively bigger and varied CFL numbers. A potentially generalizable algorithm is used to design stable implicit R-K methods. As the work focuses on two and three-stage schemes, a comprehensive comparison using numerical test cases document only modest gain in accuracy or efficiency over Gauss methods.]]></summary>

For differential equations with multiple order spatial derivatives, there are some shortcomings by the classical high order compact (HOC) discretization. At least one of them is reducing the computational efficiency due to the multiple inverse manipulation of matrices. This motivates us to design a new kind of compact method what is called combined high order compact methods. The basic idea lying in this kind of method is to solve all the spatial derivatives simultaneously. Then, it is used to solve coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (CNLS) equations which contain both the first and second order derivatives. This scheme is not only more compact and accurate than standard HOC scheme and standard finite difference method with the same order, but also it can construct structure-preserving schemes. It preserves the symplectic structure and mass, and sometimes energy and momentum. Numerical experiments indicate that the new scheme can simulate the CNLS equations very accurately and efficiently. The mass and momentum are exactly preserved. The energy is preserved in some especially cases.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Fully resolving dynamics of materials with rapidly varying features involves expensive fine-scale computations which need to be conducted on macroscopic scales. The theory of homogenization provides an approach for deriving effective macroscopic equations which eliminates the small scales by exploiting scale separation. An accurate homogenized model avoids the computationally expensive task of numerically solving the underlying balance laws at a fine scale, thereby rendering a numerical solution of the balance laws more computationally tractable. In complex settings, homogenization only defines the constitutive model implicitly, and machine learning can be used to learn the constitutive model explicitly from localized fine-scale simulations. In the case of one-dimensional viscoelasticity, the linearity of the model allows for a complete analysis. We establish that the homogenized constitutive model may be approximated by a recurrent neural network that captures the memory. The memory is encapsulated in the evolution of an appropriate finite set of hidden variables, which are discovered through the learning process and dependent on the history of the strain. Simulations are presented which validate the theory. Guidance for the learning of more complex models, such as arise in plasticity, using similar techniques, is given.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Optimal balance is a nonasymptotic numerical method for computing a point on an elliptic slow manifold for two-scale dynamical systems with strong gyroscopic forces. It works by solving a modified differential equation as a boundary value problem in time, where the nonlinear terms are adiabatically ramped up from zero to the fully nonlinear dynamics. A dedicated boundary value solver, however, is often not directly available. The most natural alternative is a nudging solver, where the problem is repeatedly solved forward and backward in time and the respective boundary conditions are restored whenever one of the temporal end points is visited. In this paper, we show quasi-convergence of this scheme in the sense that the termination residual of the nudging iteration is as small as the asymptotic error of the method itself, i.e., under appropriate assumptions exponentially small. This confirms that optimal balance in its nudging formulation is an effective algorithm. Further, it shows that the boundary value problem formulation of optimal balance is well posed up to at most a residual error as small as the asymptotic error of the method itself. The key step in our proof is a careful two-component Gronwall inequality.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We develop a model for investigating the impact of rainstorm variability on the formation of banded vegetation patterns in dryland ecosystems. Water input, during rare rainstorms, is modeled as an instantaneous kick to the soil water. The redistribution, from surface water to soil moisture, accounts for the impact of vegetation on infiltration rate and downslope overland flow speed. These two positive feedbacks between water and biomass distributions act on the fast timescales of rain storms. During dry periods, a classic reaction-diffusion framework is used for the slow processes associated with soil water and biomass. This pulsed-precipitation model predicts that the preferred spacing of the vegetation bands is determined by the characteristic distance that a storm pulse of water travels overland before infiltrating into the soil. In this way, the vegetation pattern is determined by the fast ecohydrological processes and may be attuned with its dryland precipitation pattern. We demonstrate how this modeling framework, suited for stochastic rain inputs, can be used to investigate possible collapse of a dryland pattern-forming ecosystem under different precipitation patterns with identical low annual mean. Model simulations suggest, for instance, that shorter rainy seasons and greater variability in storm depth may both hasten ecosystem collapse.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
A structure-preserving numerical method is presented and analyzed to simulate the motion of closed curves governed by area-conserved generalized curvature flow. We first propose a variational formulation and rigorously prove that it preserves two geometric structures of enclosed area conservation and perimeter decrease. Then the parametric finite element method is adopted to develop a semi-discrete scheme. Both the area conservation and perimeter decrease structure properties are strictly proven for the semi-discrete scheme by utilizing the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality and power mean inequality. On this basis, a fully discrete scheme is established by further taking the backward Euler method in the temporal direction and discretizing the unit normal vector appropriately. We give a rigorous proof that the scheme is structure-preserving at the discretized level. Finally, numerical results verify the structure-preserving property and reveal that the proposed method has second-order accuracy and enjoys asymptotic equal mesh distribution during the evolution.]]></summary>

In this paper, semi-discrete numerical scheme for the approximation of the periodic Vlasov-viscous Burgers’ system is developed and analyzed. The scheme is based on the coupling of discontinuous Galerkin approximations for the Vlasov equation and local discontinuous Galerkin approximations for the viscous Burgers’ equation. Both these methods use generalized numerical fluxes. The proposed scheme is both mass and momentum conservative. Based on generalized Gauss–Radau projections, optimal rates of convergence in the case of smooth compactly supported initial data are derived.

In this paper, we focus on a finite element projection method for inductionless magnetohydrodynamics equations. A fully discrete projection method based on Euler semi-implicit scheme is proposed in which continuous elements are used to approximate the Navier–Stokes equations and the divergence-conforming element is used to approximate the current density. The key of the projection method is that it must be compatible with two different spaces for calculating velocity, which leads to solve the pressure by solving a Poisson equation. The results show that the proposed projection scheme meets a discrete energy stability and the discrete current density keeps charge conservation property. In addition, this paper provides a rigorous optimal error analysis of velocity, pressure and current density. Finally, several numerical examples are performed to demonstrate both accuracy and efficiency of our proposed scheme.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Recovering temporal image sequences (videos) based on indirect, noisy, or incomplete data is an essential yet challenging task. We specifically consider the case where each data set is missing vital information, which prevents the accurate recovery of the individual images. Although some recent (variational) methods have demonstrated high-resolution image recovery based on jointly recovering sequential images, there remain robustness issues due to parameter tuning and restrictions on the type of sequential images. Here, we present a method based on hierarchical Bayesian learning for the joint recovery of sequential images that incorporates prior intra- and inter-image information. Our method restores the missing information in each image by “borrowing” it from the other images. More precisely, we couple sequential images by penalizing their pixel-wise difference. The corresponding penalty terms (one for each pixel and pair of subsequent images) are treated as weakly-informative random variables that favor small pixel-wise differences but allow occasional outliers. As a result, all of the individual reconstructions yield improved accuracy. Our method can be used for various data acquisitions and allows for uncertainty quantification. Some preliminary results indicate its potential use for sequential deblurring and magnetic resonance imaging.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We consider load controlled quasistatic evolution. Well posedness results for the nonlocal continuum model related to peridynamics are established. We show local existence and uniqueness of quasistatic evolution for load paths originating at stable critical points. These points can be associated with local energy minima among the convex set of deformations belonging to the strength domain of the material. The evolution of the displacements, however, is not constrained to lie inside the strength domain of the material. The load-controlled evolution is shown to exhibit energy balance.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A reduced order modeling strategy is proposed that can accurately capture the behavior of strongly perturbed nonlinear dynamical systems, i.e., those that are subject to general, large magnitude inputs. In contrast to standard variational approaches which consider dynamics in the neighborhood of a single reference trajectory, the proposed methodology augments the dynamics with an additional variable that continuously selects from a family of reference trajectories in order to limit truncation errors that result from neglected nonlinear terms. Provided the reference trajectories contract sufficiently rapidly in some directions, a reduced order set of equations can be obtained by choosing an appropriate coordinate system. Direct numerical approaches for computation of the necessary terms of the associated reduced order equations are provided. Crucially, because the proposed reduction strategy does not require the existence of a persistent, stable fixed point or periodic orbit, it can be implemented in situations where external inputs cause the dynamics to transition through a bifurcation. Two examples with relevance to neural control are provided. In the first, the proposed reduction strategy allows for the formulation of a numerically tractable control problem to identify energy-optimal inputs that eliminate tonic firing in a neural model. In the second example, the proposed reduction framework accurately captures successive transitions between quiescence and tonic firing across the boundary of a saddle-node on invariant circle bifurcation.]]></summary>

Parallel-in-time methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) have been the subject of intense development over recent decades, particularly for diffusion-dominated problems. It has been widely reported in the literature, however, that many of these methods perform quite poorly for advection-dominated problems. Here we analyze the particular iterative parallel-in-time algorithm of multigrid reduction-in-time (MGRIT) for discretizations of constant-wave-speed linear advection problems. We focus on common method-of-lines discretizations that employ upwind finite differences in space and Runge-Kutta methods in time. Using a convergence framework we developed in previous work, we prove for a subclass of these discretizations that, if using the standard approach of rediscretizing the fine-grid problem on the coarse grid, robust MGRIT convergence with respect to CFL number and coarsening factor is not possible. This poor convergence and non-robustness is caused, at least in part, by an inadequate coarse-grid correction for smooth Fourier modes in space-time known as characteristic components. We propose an alternative coarse-grid operator that provides a better correction of these modes. This coarse-grid operator is related to previous work and uses a semi-Lagrangian discretization combined with an implicitly treated truncation error correction. Theory and numerical experiments show the proposed coarse-grid operator yields fast MGRIT convergence for many of the method-of-lines discretizations considered, including for both implicit and explicit discretizations of high order. Parallel results demonstrate speed-up over sequential time-stepping.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Because of the high dimensionality of reaction-diffusion systems on networks, exploration for the bifurcation properties of such systems has been far less thorough than their corresponding parabolic PDE systems. With the overcoming of this long-standing difficulty, we consider the steady state bifurcation for the general network-organized reaction-diffusion system and derive the algorithm of calculating the perturbation incorporated restricted system associated with the simple zero singularity, through seeking out the parameter dependent center manifolds belonging to the unique zero eigenvalue. Rigorous theoretical analysis for the third-order truncated restricted system shows that the complex underlying networks can trigger some bifurcation types differing from the usual supercritical and subcritical pitchfork bifurcations and so enrich the dynamical behaviors of reaction-diffusion process in networks. To illustrate the application for our obtained theoretical results, we conduct a strict steady state bifurcation analysis for a metapopulation epidemic system defined on four typical connected undirected underlying networks, and find that there exist some new multistability phenomena and hysteresis effects in the irregular small-word and scale-free lattice network.]]></summary>

In this paper, a Quadrature by Two Expansions (QB2X) numerical integration technique is developed for the single and double layer potentials of the Helmholtz equation in two dimensions. The QB2X method uses both local complex Taylor expansions and plane wave type expansions to achieve a resulting representation which is numerically accurate for all target points inside a leaf box in the fast multipole method (FMM) hierarchical tree structure. The QB2X method explicitly includes nonlinear dependency of the boundary geometry in the plane wave expansions, thereby providing for higher-order representations of both the boundary geometry and density functions in the integrand, with its convergence following standard FMM error analysis. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the QB2X method for Helmholtz layer potentials using one expansion center for the entire FMM-leaf box for both flat and curved boundaries with various densities.]]></summary>

We develop flux globalization based well-balanced central-upwind schemes for hydrodynamic equations with general free energy. The proposed schemes are well-balanced in the sense that they are capable of exactly preserving quite complicated steady-state solutions and also exactly capturing traveling waves, even when vacuum regions are present. In order to accurately track interfaces of the vacuum regions and near vacuum parts of the solution, we use the technique introduced in Chertock et al. (J Sci Comput 90:Paper No. 9, 2022) and design a hybrid approach: inside the no vacuum regions, we use the flux globalization based well-balanced central-upwind scheme, while elsewhere we implement the central-upwind scheme similar to the one proposed in Bollermann et al. (J Sci Comput 56:267–290, 2013) in the context of wet/dry fronts in the shallow water equations. The advantages of the proposed schemes are demonstrated on a number of challenging numerical examples.]]></summary>

Within the last years pressure robust methods for the discretization of incompressible fluids have been developed. These methods allow the use of standard finite elements for the solution of the problem while simultaneously removing a spurious pressure influence in the approximation error of the velocity of the fluid, or the displacement of an incompressible solid. To this end, reconstruction operators are utilized mapping discretely divergence free functions to divergence free functions. This work shows that the modifications proposed for Stokes equation by Linke (Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 268:782–800, 2014) also yield gradient robust methods for nearly incompressible elastic materials without the need to resort to discontinuous finite elements methods as proposed in Fu et al. (J Sci Comput 86(3):39–30, 2021).]]></summary>

 Abstract. We analyze the mathematical model that describes the heat generated by electromagnetic nanoparticles. We use the known optical properties of the nanoparticles to control the support and amount of the heat needed around a nanoparticle. Precisely, we show that the dominant part of the heat around the nanoparticle is the electric field multiplied by a constant which is explicitly and solely dependent on the permittivity and quantities related to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the magnetization (or the Newtonian) operator, defined on the nanoparticle, and inversely proportional to the distance to the nanoparticle. The nanoparticles are described via the Lorentz model. If the used incident frequency is chosen related to the plasmonic frequency [math] (via the magnetization operator), then the nanoparticle behaves as a plasmonic one; if it is chosen related to the undamped resonance frequency [math] (via the Newtonian operator), then it behaves as a dielectric one. The two regimes exhibit different optical behaviors. In both cases, we estimate the generated heat and discuss advantages of each incident frequency regime. The analysis is based on time-domain integral equation techniques, avoiding the use of (formal) Fourier type transformations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Imposition methods of interface conditions for the second-order wave equation with non-conforming grids is considered. The spatial discretization is based on high order finite differences with summation-by-parts properties. Previously presented solution methods for this problem, based on the simultaneous approximation term (SAT) method, have shown to introduce significant stiffness. This can lead to highly inefficient schemes. Here, two new methods of imposing the interface conditions to avoid the stiffness problems are presented: (1) a projection method and (2) a hybrid between the projection method and the SAT method. Numerical experiments are performed using traditional and order-preserving interpolation operators. Both of the novel methods retain the accuracy and convergence behavior of the previously developed SAT method but are significantly less stiff.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Optimal packing is applied in physics for investigation of macroscopic properties of composites and porous media. The present paper demonstrates that the optimal packing of perfectly conducting disks on the plane corresponds to the minimal effective conductivity for macroscopically isotropic composites. Such an optimal location is studied and compared to the pure geometric problem for [math] disks packing on the flat torus. The hexagonal (triangular) array of disks solves the problem for the triangle lattice numbers [math]. The rest of the cases [math] are investigated separately by minimization of structural sums constructed by means of the Eisenstein functions.]]></summary>
