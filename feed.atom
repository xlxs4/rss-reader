        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is a major vector of arthropod-borne viruses, including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. A novel approach to mitigate arboviral infections is to generate mosquitoes refractory to infection by overexpressing antiviral effector molecules. Such an approach requires a mechanism to spread these antiviral effectors through a population, for example, by using CRISPR/Cas9-based gene drive (GD) systems. Critical to the design of a single-locus autonomous GD is that the selected genomic locus be amenable to both GD and appropriate expression of the antiviral effector. In our study, we used reverse engineering to target two intergenic genomic loci, which had previously shown to be highly permissive for antiviral effector gene expression, and we further investigat…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atmospheric CO2 poses a major threat to life on Earth by causing global warming and climate change. On the other hand, it is the only carbon source that is scalable enough to establish a circular carbon economy. Accordingly, technologies to capture and convert CO2 to reduced one-carbon (C1) molecules (e.g. formate) using renewable energy are improving fast. Driven by the idea of creating sustainable bioproduction platforms, natural and synthetic C1-utilization pathways are engineered into industrially relevant microbes. The realization of synthetic C1-assimilation cycles in living organisms is a promising but challenging endeavour. Here, we engineer the autocatalytic serine threonine cycle, a synthetic C1-assimilation route in Escherichia coli. Our stepwise engineering approach in tailored selection strains combined with adaptive laboratory evolution experiments enabled the organism to grow on formate. The synthetic strain uses formate as the sole carbon and energy source and is capable of growing at ambient CO2 concentrations, demonstrating the feasibility of establishing synthetic C1-assimilation cycles over laboratory timescales.]]></summary>

Identifying protein modifications, such as phosphorylation, that dictate these interactions remains a defining challenge in unraveling the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis. We have developed a platform in engineered bacteria that displays over 110,000 phosphorylated human proteins coupled to a fluorescent reporter system capable of identifying the host-pathogen interactome of phosphoproteins (H-PIP). This resource broadly enables cell-type independent interrogation and discovery of proteins from intracellular pathogens capable of binding phosphorylated human proteins. As an example of the H-PIP platform, we generated a unique, high-resolution SARS-CoV-2 interaction network which expanded our knowledge of viral protein function and identified understudied areas of host pathology.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rho promotes Rho-dependent termination (RDT) at the Rho-dependent terminator, producing a variable-length region at the 3-end of mRNA without secondary structure. Determining the exact RDT site in vivo is challenging because the 3'-end of mRNA is rapidly removed by 3'- to 5'-exoribonuclease digestion after RDT. Here, we applied synthetic sRNA (sysRNA) to pinpoint RDT sites in vivo by exploiting its complementary base-pairing ability to target mRNA. Through the combined assays of rapid amplification of cDNA 3-ends, primer extension, and capillary electrophoresis, we could precisely locate and quantify mRNA 3-ends. We found that complementary double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formed between sysRNA and mRNA was efficiently cleaved by RNase III in the middle of the dsRNA region. The formation of dsRNA seems to protect the cleaved RNA 3-ends from rapid degradation by 3- to 5- exonuclease, thereby stabilizing the mRNA 3-end. We further verified that the signal intensity at the 3-end was positively correlated with amounts of mRNA. By constructing a series of sysRNAs with target sites in close proximity, and comparing the difference in signal intensity at the 3-end of wild-type and Rho-impaired strains, we finally identified a region of increased mRNA expression within 21 bp range, which was determined as RDT site. Our results demonstrated the ability to use sysRNA as a novel tool to precisely localize RDTs in vivo and expanded the range of sysRNA applications.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many open questions about the mechanisms that coordinate the dynamic, multicellular behaviors required for organogenesis. Synthetic circuits that can record in vivo signaling networks have been critical in elucidating animal development. Here, we report on the transfer of this technology to plants using orthogonal serine integrases to mediate site-specific and irreversible DNA recombination visualized by switching between fluorescent reporters. When combined with promoters expressed during lateral root initiation, integrases amplified reporter signal and permanently marked all descendants. In addition, we have developed a suite of methods to tune the threshold for integrase switching, including: RNA/protein degradation tags, a nuclear localization signal, and a split-intein system. These tools improved the robustness of integrase-mediated switching with different promoters and the stability of switching behavior over multiple generations. This integrase toolbox can be used to build history-dependent circuits to decode the order of expression during organogenesis in many contexts.]]></summary>

Irregular easy axis reorientation features are observed in numerical simulations of the nanomagnet coupled to the Josephson junction. We study magnetization bifurcations and chaos that appear in this system due to the interplay of superconductivity and magnetism. The bifurcation structure of magnetization under the variation of Josephson to magnetic energy ratio as a control parameter demonstrates several precessional motions that are related to chaotic behavior and orbits with different periodicities in the ferromagnetic resonance region. The effect of an external periodic signal on the bifurcation structure is also investigated. The results demonstrate high-frequency modes of a periodic motion and a chaotic response near resonance. Far from the ferromagnetic resonance, we observe a quasiperiodic behavior. The obtained results explain the irregular reorientation of the easy axis and the transitions between different types of motion.]]></summary>

An insufficient supply of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in most countries demands an effective vaccination strategy to minimize the damage caused by the disease. Currently, many countries vaccinate their population in descending order of age (i.e., descending order of fatality rate) to minimize the deaths caused by the disease; however, the effectiveness of this strategy needs to be quantitatively assessed. We employ the susceptible–infected–recovered–dead model to investigate various vaccination strategies. We constructed a metapopulation model with heterogeneous contact and fatality rates and investigated the effectiveness of vaccination strategies to reduce epidemic mortality. We found that the fatality-based strategy, which is currently employed in many countries, is more effective when the contagion rate is high and vaccine supply is low, but the contact-based method outperforms the fatality-based strategy when there is a sufficiently high supply of the vaccine. We identified a discontinuous transition of the optimal vaccination strategy and path-dependency analogous to hysteresis. This transition and path-dependency imply that combining the fatality-based and contact-based strategies is ineffective in reducing the number of deaths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such phenomena occur in real-world epidemic diseases, such as tuberculosis and COVID-19. We also show that the conclusions of this research are valid even when the complex epidemic stages, efficacy of the vaccine, and reinfection are considered.]]></summary>

Theoretical foundations of chaos have been predominantly laid out for finite-dimensional dynamical systems, such as the three-body problem in classical mechanics and the Lorenz model in dissipative systems. In contrast, many real-world chaotic phenomena, e.g., weather, arise in systems with many (formally infinite) degrees of freedom, which limits direct quantitative analysis of such systems using chaos theory. In the present work, we demonstrate that the hydrodynamic pilot-wave systems offer a bridge between low- and high-dimensional chaotic phenomena by allowing for a systematic study of how the former connects to the latter. Specifically, we present experimental results, which show the formation of low-dimensional chaotic attractors upon destabilization of regular dynamics and a final transition to high-dimensional chaos via the merging of distinct chaotic regions through a crisis bifurcation. Moreover, we show that the post-crisis dynamics of the system can be rationalized as consecutive scatterings from the nonattracting chaotic sets with lifetimes following exponential distributions.]]></summary>

Pinning control of cluster synchronization in a globally connected network of chaotic oscillators is studied. It is found in simulations that when the pinning strength exceeds a critical value, the oscillators are synchronized into two different clusters, one formed by the pinned oscillators and the other one formed by the unpinned oscillators. The numerical results are analyzed by the generalized method of master stability function (MSF), in which it is shown that whereas the method is able to predict the synchronization behaviors of the pinned oscillators, it fails to predict the synchronization behaviors of the unpinned oscillators. By checking the trajectories of the oscillators in the phase space, it is found that the failure is attributed to the deformed synchronization manifold of the unpinned oscillators, which is clearly deviated from that of isolated oscillator under strong pinnings. A similar phenomenon is also observed in the pinning control of cluster synchronization in a complex network of symmetric structures and in the self-organized cluster synchronization of networked neural oscillators. The findings are important complements to the generalized MSF method and provide an alternative approach to the manipulation of synchronization behaviors in complex network systems.]]></summary>

We study the dynamics of an oscillatory system with pulse delayed feedback and noise of two types: (i) phase noise acting on the oscillator and (ii) stochastic fluctuations of the feedback delay. Using an event-based approach, we reduce the system dynamics to a stochastic discrete map. For weak noise, we find that the oscillator fluctuates around a deterministic state, and we derive an autoregressive model describing the system dynamics. For stronger noise, the oscillator demonstrates noise-induced switching between various deterministic states; our theory provides a good estimate of the switching statistics in the linear limit. We show that the robustness of the system toward this switching is strikingly different depending on the type of noise. We compare the analytical results for linear coupling to numerical simulations of nonlinear coupling and find that the linear model also provides a qualitative explanation for the differences in robustness to both types of noise. Moreover, phase noise drives the system toward higher frequencies, while stochastic delays do not, and we relate this effect to our theoretical results.]]></summary>

We study the formation of images in a reflective sphere in three configurations using caustics on the field of light rays. The optical wavefront emerging from a source point reaching a subject following passage through the optical system is, in general, a Gaussian surface with partial focus along the two principal directions of the Gaussian surface; i.e., there are two images of the source point, each with partial focus. As the source point moves, the images move on two surfaces, referred to as viewable surfaces. In our systems, one viewable surface consists of points with radial focus and the other consists of points with azimuthal focus. The problems we study are (1) imaging of a parallel beam of light, (2) imaging of the infinite viewed from a location outside the sphere, and (3) imaging of a planar object viewed through the point of its intersection with the radial line normal to the plane. We verify the existence of two images experimentally and show that the distance between them agrees with the computations.]]></summary>

Higher-order interactions have significant implications for the dynamics of competing epidemic spreads. In this paper, a competing spread model for two simplicial irreversible epidemics (i.e., susceptible–infected–removed epidemics) on higher-order networks is proposed. The simplicial complexes are based on synthetic (including homogeneous and heterogeneous) and real-world networks. The spread process of two epidemics is theoretically analyzed by extending the microscopic Markov chain approach. When the two epidemics have the same 2-simplex infection rate and the 1-simplex infection rate of epidemic [math] ([math]) is fixed at zero, an increase in the 1-simplex infection rate of epidemic [math] ([math]) causes a transition from continuous growth to sharp growth in the spread of epidemic [math] with [math]. When [math], the growth of epidemic [math] is always continuous. With the increase of [math], the outbreak threshold of epidemic [math] is delayed. When the difference in 1-simplex infection rates between the two epidemics reaches approximately three times, the stronger side obviously dominates. Otherwise, the coexistence of the two epidemics is always observed. When the 1-simplex infection rates are symmetrical, the increase in competition will accelerate the spread process and expand the spread area of both epidemics; when the 1-simplex infection rates are asymmetrical, the spread area of one epidemic increases with an increase in the 1-simplex infection rate from this epidemic while the other decreases. Finally, the influence of 2-simplex infection rates on the competing spread is discussed. An increase in 2-simplex infection rates leads to sharp growth in one of the epidemics.]]></summary>

In this paper, we focus on the fourth-order nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which can describe the optical system and the Heisenberg spin system. We consider a continuous wave perturbed by the one-dimensional random rough surface as the initial condition. First, we numerically resolve the eigenvalues under different control parameters utilizing the Fourier collocation method. Then, we simulate the evolution of this equation under the above initial conditions via the symmetrical split-step Fourier method. Moreover, we investigate the “steady” chaotic state by evolving a large number of initial conditions for the same control parameters. We find that the control parameters of the initial condition affect the number and intensity of rogue waves (RWs) in integrable turbulence. In particular, we locate the inflection point where the control parameter affects the velocities of solitons and the inconsistency within the parameter of the contribution to the generation of RWs. We further verify that the collision between breathers, solitons, and breathers and solitons can generate RWs. These results will enable us to understand the turbulent state and the formation mechanism of RWs.]]></summary>

Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the cases of one and three networks. A perfect correlation between the MATLAB and PSpice results was obtained, thus allowing the experimental validation of our designed controller and shows the effectiveness of the theoretical results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A major challenge in synthetic biology is the manipulation of engineered gene circuits toward a specified behavior. This challenge becomes more difficult as synthetic systems become more complex by incorporating additional genes or strains. Here we demonstrate that circuit dynamics can be tuned in synthetic consortia through the manipulation of strain fractions within the community. To do this, we constructed a microbial consortium comprised of three strains of engineered Escherichia coli that, when co-cultured, use homoserine lactone (HSL) mediated intercellular signaling to create a multi-strain incoherent type-1 feedforward loop (I1-FFL). Like naturally occurring I1-FFL motifs in gene networks, this engineered microbial consortium acts as a pulse generator of gene expression. We demonstrated that the amplitude of the pulse can be easily tuned by adjusting the relative population fractions of the strains. We created a mathematical model for the temporal dynamics of the microbial consortium and, using this model, identified population fractions that produced desired pulse characteristics. Our work demonstrates that intercellular gene circuits can be effectively tuned simply by adjusting the starting fractions of each strain type.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Streptomyces phage OC31 encodes a serine integrase which recombines the host (attB) and phage (attP) attachment sites to form new attL and attR sites. For attL and attR to be recombined by the integrase, the presence of its cognate recombination directionality factor (RDF) is required. It is hypothesized that the RDF binds the coiled-coil domain of the integrase to accomplish this switch in recombination directionality. Yet, nothing is known about the site of interaction between the RDF and integrase. Here, we tried to identify the region on the coiled-coil domain of OC31 integrase to which its cognate RDF (gp3) might bind. Mutant integrases fused to their cognate RDF (gp3) were created and selected for inactivity in attL x attR recombination. It was not possible to characterize the mutants and identify the Int-RDF binding region, due to unforeseen errors that occurred during the construction of the mutant library, but we demonstrated that simple experimental approaches could be used to identify this region. Despite this, an integrase mutant (P398L D595N) fused to gp3 was characterized. This mutant was catalyzing a more unidirectional attL x attR recombination reaction with reduced attP x attB recombination compared to the wild-type integrase. This mutant was selected since it could be used within the field of molecular biology to construct inversion switches which are a key element by which cells can be computerized.]]></summary>

We used an Escherichia coli platform with a phenylalanine biosynthesis pathway reconfigured ( plantized) to mimic the plant pathway, a T7RNA polymerase-base deaminase hypermutation system (eMutaT7), and 4-fluorophenylalanine as selective agent. Selection schemes were pre-validated using a known feedback-resistant AtADT2 variant.

We also develop compositional analysis to determine the chain length and unsaturation of the fatty acids in living cells. Our method reveals substantial heterogeneity in fatty acid production among and within colonies that emerges over the course of many generations. Interestingly, the strains display distinct types of production heterogeneity in an enzyme-dependent manner. By pairing time-lapse and SRS imaging, we examine the relationship between growth and production at the single-cell level. Single-cell quantification does not show a significant growth-production tradeoff in a strain that exhibits high production heterogeneity.

Symmetries, due to their fundamental importance to dynamical processes on networks, have attracted a great deal of current research. Finding all symmetric nodes in large complex networks typically relies on automorphism groups from algebraic-group theory, which are solvable in quasipolynomial time. We articulate a conceptually appealing and computationally extremely efficient approach to finding and characterizing all symmetric nodes by introducing a structural position vector (SPV) for each node in networks. We establish the mathematical result that symmetric nodes must have the same SPV value and demonstrate, using six representative complex networks from the real world, that all symmetric nodes in these networks can be found in linear time. Furthermore, the SPVs not only characterize the similarity of nodes but also quantify the nodal influences in propagation dynamics. A caveat is that the proved mathematical result relating the SPV values to nodal symmetries is not sufficient; i.e., nodes having the same SPV values may not be symmetric, which arises in regular networks or networks with a dominant regular component. We point out with an analysis that this caveat is, in fact, shared by the known existing approaches to finding symmetric nodes in the literature. We further argue, with the aid of a mathematical analysis, that our SPV method is generally effective for finding the symmetric nodes in real-world networks that typically do not have a dominant regular component. Our SPV-based framework, therefore, provides a physically intuitive and computationally efficient way to uncover, understand, and exploit symmetric structures in complex networks arising from real-world applications.]]></summary>

The Kuramoto model describes the synchronization of coupled oscillators that have different natural frequencies. Among the many generalizations of the original model, Kuramoto and Sakaguchi (KS) proposed a frustrated version that resulted in dynamic behavior of the order parameter, even when the average natural frequency of the oscillators is zero. Here, we consider a generalization of the frustrated KS model that exhibits new transitions to synchronization. The model is identical in form to the original Kuramoto model but written in terms of unit vectors and with the coupling constant replaced by a coupling matrix. The matrix breaks the rotational symmetry and forces the order parameter to point in the direction of the eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue, when the eigenvalues are real. For complex eigenvalues, the module of order parameter oscillates while it rotates around the unit circle, creating active states. We derive the complete phase diagram for the Lorentzian distribution of frequencies using the Ott–Antonsen ansatz. We also show that changing the average value of the natural frequencies leads to further phase transitions where the module of the order parameter goes from oscillatory to static.]]></summary>

The Turing pattern is an important dynamic behavior characteristic of activator–inhibitor systems. Differentiating from traditional assumption of activator–inhibitor interactions in a spatially continuous domain, a Turing pattern in networked reaction-diffusion systems has received much attention during the past few decades. In spite of its great progress, it still fails to evaluate the precise influences of network topology on pattern formation. To this end, we try to promote the research on this important and interesting issue from the point of view of average degree—a critical topological feature of networks. We first qualitatively analyze the influence of average degree on pattern formation. Then, a quantitative relationship between pattern formation and average degree, the exponential decay of pattern formation, is proposed via nonlinear regression. The finding holds true for several activator–inhibitor systems including biology model, ecology model, and chemistry model. The significance of this study lies that the exponential decay not only quantitatively depicts the influence of average degree on pattern formation, but also provides the possibility for predicting and controlling pattern formation.]]></summary>

A passive electrochemical coupling approach is proposed to induce spontaneous synchronization between chemical oscillators. The coupling exploits the potential difference between a catalyst redox couple in the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, without external feedback, to induce surface reactions that impact the kinetics of the bulk system. The effect of coupling in BZ oscillators under batch condition is characterized using phase synchronization measures. Although the frequency of the oscillators decreases nonlinearly over time, by a factor of 2 or more within 100 cycles, the coupling is strong enough to maintain synchronization. In such a highly drifting system, the Gibbs–Shannon entropy of the cyclic phase difference distribution can be used to quantify the coupling effect. We extend the Oregonator BZ model to account for the drifting natural frequencies in batch condition and for electrochemical coupling, and numerical simulations of the effect of acid concentration on synchronization patterns are in agreement with the experiments. Because of the passive nature of coupling, the proposed coupling scheme can open avenues for designing pattern recognition and neuromorphic computation systems using chemical reactions in a spontaneous process.]]></summary>

We study the deterministic dynamics of [math] point particles moving at a constant speed in a 2D table made of two polygonal urns connected by an active rectangular channel, which applies a feedback control on the particles, inverting the horizontal component of their velocities when their number in the channel exceeds a fixed threshold. Such a bounce-back mechanism is non-dissipative: it preserves volumes in phase space. An additional passive channel closes the billiard table forming a circuit in which a stationary current may flow. Under specific constraints on the geometry and on the initial conditions, the large [math] limit allows nonequilibrium phase transitions between homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases. The role of ergodicity in making a probabilistic theory applicable is discussed for both rational and irrational urns. The theoretical predictions are compared with the numerical simulation results. Connections with the dynamics of feedback-controlled biological systems are highlighted.]]></summary>

In many real-world interdependent network systems, nodes often work together to form groups, which can enhance robustness to resist risks. However, previous group percolation models are always of a first-order phase transition, regardless of the group size distribution. This motivates us to investigate a generalized model for group percolation in interdependent networks with a reinforcement network layer to eliminate collapse. Some backup devices that are equipped for a density [math] of reinforced nodes constitute the reinforcement network layer. For each group, we assume that at least one node of the group can function in one network and a node in another network depends on the group to function. We find that increasing the density [math] of reinforcement nodes and the size [math] of the dependency group can significantly enhance the robustness of interdependent networks. Importantly, we find the existence of a hybrid phase transition behavior and propose a method for calculating the shift point of percolation types. The most interesting finding is the exact universal solution to the minimal density [math] of reinforced nodes (or the minimum group size [math]) to prevent abrupt collapse for Erdős–Rényi, scale-free, and regular random interdependent networks. Furthermore, we present the validity of the analytic solutions for a triple point [math] (or [math]), the corresponding phase transition point [math], and second-order phase transition points [math] in interdependent networks. These findings might yield a broad perspective for designing more resilient interdependent infrastructure networks.]]></summary>

We investigate the localization of invariant spanning curves for a family of two-dimensional area-preserving mappings described by the dynamical variables [math] and [math] by using Slater’s criterion. The Slater theorem says there are three different return times for an irrational translation over a circle in a given interval. The returning time, which measures the number of iterations a map needs to return to a given periodic or quasi periodic region, has three responses along an invariant spanning curve. They are related to a continued fraction expansion used in the translation and obey the Fibonacci sequence. The rotation numbers for such curves are related to a noble number, leading to a devil’s staircase structure. The behavior of the rotation number as a function of invariant spanning curves located by Slater’s criterion resulted in an expression of a power law in which the absolute value of the exponent is equal to the control parameter [math] that controls the speed of the divergence of [math] in the limit the action [math] is sufficiently small.]]></summary>

Supply-chain systems (SCSs) are an indispensable part of our daily infrastructures. Note that a small perturbation in a SCS can be amplified, eliciting cascading failures. It is of significant value to ensure a high resilience of SCSs. However, due to the complexity of SCSs, it is quite challenging to study their resilience under conditions of perturbations. In view of this, this paper presents a complex network perspective toward the resilience of SCSs. To achieve this goal, a complex SCS is modeled as a multilayer supply-chain network (SCN) with physical organizations being modeled as nodes and interactions among them as edges. A modeled SCN contains three types of nodes, i.e., suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers. An algorithm is proposed to construct a multilayer SCN. For each layer of a multilayer SCN, two kinds of networks, i.e., networks with Poisson degree distributions and networks with power-law degree distributions, are considered. For a given multilayer SCN, a ripple-effect network model is proposed to analyze its resilience under perturbations. Regarding the perturbations, two scenarios, i.e., random node failures and target node failures, are adopted in this research. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed network perspective, simulations on computer-generated SCNs are carried out. Interestingly, it is found that the resilience of SCNs under both random and target perturbations presents a discontinuous phase-change phenomenon, which indicates that SCNs are quite fragile under perturbations. It is further noticed that SCNs with power-law degree distributions are relatively more robust than SCNs with Poisson degree distributions. Although SCNs are found to be fragile, it has been discovered that denser interactions between different system organizations can enhance the network’s resilience.]]></summary>

Furthermore, snapshots at different time [math] that are taken to collect data for the distribution function [math] of the domain size [math] of the M-phase are found to obey dynamic scaling.

Consider [math] identical Kuramoto oscillators on a random graph. Specifically, consider Erdős–Rényi random graphs in which any two oscillators are bidirectionally coupled with unit strength, independently and at random, with probability [math]. We say that a network is globally synchronizing if the oscillators converge to the all-in-phase synchronous state for almost all initial conditions. Is there a critical threshold for [math] above which global synchrony is extremely likely but below which it is extremely rare? It is suspected that a critical threshold exists and is close to the so-called connectivity threshold, namely, [math] for [math]. Ling, Xu, and Bandeira made the first progress toward proving a result in this direction: they showed that if [math], then Erdős–Rényi networks of Kuramoto oscillators are globally synchronizing with high probability as [math]. Here, we improve that result by showing that [math] suffices. Our estimates are explicit: for example, we can say that there is more than a [math] chance that a random network with [math] and [math] is globally synchronizing.]]></summary>

In this paper, a Riemann–Hilbert approach to a two-component modified short-pulse (mSP) system on the line with zero boundary conditions is developed. A parametric representation of the solution to the related Cauchy problem is obtained. Four nonlocal integrable reductions, namely, the real reverse space-time nonlocal focusing and defocusing mSP equations and the complex reverse space-time nonlocal focusing and defocusing mSP equations, are studied in detail. For each case, soliton solutions are presented, and, unlike their local counterparts, the nonlocal equations exhibit certain novel properties induced by the impact of nonlocality.]]></summary>

We disclose a new class of patterns, called patched patterns, in arrays of non-locally coupled excitable units with attractive and repulsive interactions. The self-organization process involves the formation of two types of patches, majority and minority ones, characterized by uniform average spiking frequencies. Patched patterns may be temporally periodic, quasiperiodic, or chaotic, whereby chaotic patterns may further develop interfaces comprised of units with average frequencies in between those of majority and minority patches. Using chaos and bifurcation theory, we demonstrate that chaos typically emerges via a torus breakup and identify the secondary bifurcation that gives rise to chaotic interfaces. It is shown that the maximal Lyapunov exponent of chaotic patched patterns does not decay, but rather converges to a finite value with system size. Patched patterns with a smaller wavenumber may exhibit diffusive motion of chaotic interfaces, similar to that of the incoherent part of chimeras.]]></summary>

An effective and stable operation of an economic system leads to a prosperous society and sustainable world development. Unfortunately, the system faces inevitable perturbations of extreme events and is frequently damaged. To maintain the system's stability, recovering its damaged functionality is essential and is complementary to strengthening its resilience and forecasting extreme events. This paper proposes a target recovery method based on network and economic equilibrium theories to defend the economic system against perturbations characterized as localized attacks. This novel method stimulates a set of economic sectors that mutually reinforce damaged economic sectors and is intuitively named the target reinforcement path (TRP) method. Developing a nonlinear dynamic model that simulates the economic system's operation after being perturbed by a localized attack and recovering based on a target recovery method, we compute the relaxation time for this process to quantify the method's efficiency. Furthermore, we adopt a rank aggregation method to comprehensively measure the method's efficiency by studying the target recovery of three country-level economic systems (China, India, and Japan) for 73 different regional attack scenarios. Through a comparative analysis of the TRP method and three other classic methods, the TRP method is shown to be more effective and less costly. Applicatively, the proposed method exhibits the potential to recover other vital complex systems with spontaneous recovery ability, such as immune, neurological, and ecological systems.]]></summary>

The system of two resources [math] and [math] and one consumer [math] is investigated within the Rosenzweig–MacArthur model with a Holling type II functional response. The rates of consumption of particular resources are normalized as to keep their sum constant. Dynamic switching is introduced as to increase the variable [math] in a process of finite speed. The space of parameters where both resources coexist is explored numerically. The results indicate that oscillations of [math] and mutually synchronized [math], which appear equal for the rates of consumption, are destabilized when these rates are modified. Then, the system is driven to one of fixed points or to a limit cycle with a much smaller amplitude. As a consequence of symmetry between the resources, the consumer cannot change the preferred resource once it is chosen.]]></summary>

In mobile communication systems, congestion is related to high-traffic events (HTEs) that occur in the coverage areas of base stations. Understanding, recognizing, and predicting these HTEs and researching their occurrence rules provides theoretical and decision-making support for preventing system congestion. Communication sectors are regarded as nodes, and if HTEs occur synchronously among sectors, then the corresponding nodes are connected. The total number of synchronous HTEs determines the edge weights. The mobile-communication spatiotemporal data are mapped to a weighted network, with the occurrence locations of HTEs as the basic elements. Network analysis provides a structure for representing the interaction of HTEs. By analyzing the topological features of the event synchronization network, the associations among the occurrence times of HTEs can be mined. We find that the event synchronization network is a small-world network, the cumulative strength distribution is exponential, and the edge weight obeys a power law. Moreover, the node clustering coefficient is negatively correlated with the node degree. A congestion coefficient based on several topological parameters is proposed, and the system congestion is visualized. The congestion coefficient contains information about the synchronous occurrence of HTEs between a sector and its neighbors and information about the synchronous occurrence of HTEs among its neighbors. For the mobile communication system considered in this study, the congestion coefficient of a large number of sectors is small and the risk of system congestion is low.]]></summary>

Shoot apical meristems (SAMs) give rise to all above-ground tissues of a plant. Expansion of meristematic tissue is derived from the growth and division of stem cells that reside in a central zone of the SAM. This reservoir of stem cells is maintained by expression of a transcription factor WUSCHEL that is responsible for the development of stem cells in the central zone. WUSCHEL expression is self-activating and downregulated by a signaling pathway initiated by CLAVATA proteins, which are upregulated by WUSCHEL. This classic activator–inhibitor network can generate localized patterns of WUSCHEL activity by a Turing instability provided certain constraints on reaction rates and diffusion constants of WUSCHEL and CLAVATA are satisfied, and most existing mathematical models of nucleation and confinement of stem cells in the SAM rely on Turing's mechanism. However, Turing patterns have certain properties that are inconsistent with observed patterns of stem cell differentiation in the SAM. As an alternative mechanism, we propose a model for stem cell confinement based on a bistable-switch in WUSCHEL–CLAVATA interactions. We study the bistable-switch mechanism for pattern formation in a spatially continuous domain and in a discrete cellularized tissue in the presence of a non-uniform field of a rapidly diffusing hormone. By comparing domain formation by Turing and bistable-switch mechanisms in these contexts, we show that bistable switching provides a superior account of nucleation and confinement of the stem cell domain under reasonable assumptions on reaction rates and diffusion constants.]]></summary>

Fractional Brownian motion, a Gaussian non-Markovian self-similar process with stationary long-correlated increments, has been identified to give rise to the anomalous diffusion behavior in a great variety of physical systems. The correlation and diffusion properties of this random motion are fully characterized by its index of self-similarity or the Hurst exponent. However, recent single-particle tracking experiments in biological cells revealed highly complicated anomalous diffusion phenomena that cannot be attributed to a class of self-similar random processes. Inspired by these observations, we here study the process that preserves the properties of the fractional Brownian motion at a single trajectory level; however, the Hurst index randomly changes from trajectory to trajectory. We provide a general mathematical framework for analytical, numerical, and statistical analysis of the fractional Brownian motion with the random Hurst exponent. The explicit formulas for probability density function, mean-squared displacement, and autocovariance function of the increments are presented for three generic distributions of the Hurst exponent, namely, two-point, uniform, and beta distributions. The important features of the process studied here are accelerating diffusion and persistence transition, which we demonstrate analytically and numerically.]]></summary>

In this paper, the impact of environmental noise on prey–predator interactions with seasonal fluctuations in water levels has been studied. Both intensity of noise and water level variations together play a significant role in the dynamics of an aquatic prey–predator system. Analytically, we have shown the existence of a positive solution and its uniqueness, the ultimate bound of the system’s solutions, and the global attractivity of the solution. Moreover, parametric conditions for which model species either persist (strongly or weakly) in the system or go into extinction are derived and their biological significance is also discussed. The sufficient condition of stochastic permanence is also analyzed. To justify the analytical results, we have performed numerical simulations of both deterministic and stochastic systems and observed some significant dynamics in the considered system.]]></summary>

The goal of this study is explicit demarcation of the region of validity of a linear canonical representation for chaotic advection of Lagrangian fluid parcels in “chaotic seas” in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) time-periodic fluid flows governed by Hamiltonian mechanics. The concept of lobe dynamics admits exact and unique geometric demarcation of this region and, inherently, distinction of the portions of chaotic seas with essentially linear vs nonlinear Lagrangian transport. This, furthermore, admits explicit establishment of a topological equivalence between the (embedded) Hamiltonian structure of the Lagrangian dynamics in 2D (3D) flows and their canonical form. The linear transport region in physical space encompasses four adjacent subregions that each corresponds to one of the four quadrants in canonical space and may exchange material with their environment in two essentially nonlinear ways. First, exchange between quadrants within the linear transport region and, second, exchange with the exterior of this region. Both forms of exchange can be linked to specific subsets of material elements defined by interacting lobes and combined give rise to circulation through the quadrants of the linear transport region that systematically exchanges the material with the exterior.]]></summary>

Recognizing surrounding situations, such as enemy attacks, which can be realized by predator–prey relationships, is one of the common behaviors of the population in ecosystems. In this paper, we explore the relationship between such species’ behavior and biodiversity in the spatial rock–paper–scissors game by employing the ecological concept “vigilance.” In order to describe the vigilance process, we adopt a multiplex structure where two distinct layers describe virtual and physical interactions. By investigating the process of evolution in species, we also found that species with different vigilance go together. In addition, by utilizing the dynamic time warping method, we found that species with the same vigilance have consistent behavior, but species with different vigilance have diverse behavior. Our findings may lead to broader interpretations of mechanisms promoting biodiversity via vigilance in species ecosystems.]]></summary>

We propose a simple method of constructing a system of differential equations of chaotic behavior based on the regression only from scalar observable time-series data. The estimated system enables us to reconstruct invariant sets and statistical properties as well as to infer short time-series. Our successful modeling relies on the introduction of a set of Gaussian radial basis functions to capture local structures. The proposed method is used to construct a system of ordinary differential equations whose orbit reconstructs a time-series of a variable of the well-known Lorenz system as a simple but typical example. A system for a macroscopic fluid variable is also constructed.]]></summary>

Ordinal patterns can be used to construct non-parametric hypothesis tests that aim to discover (possibly non-linear) serial dependence in a real-valued time series. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the vector of sample frequencies of ordinal patterns and that of various corresponding tests statistics such that the targeted tests for serial dependence are easily implemented based on asymptotic approximations. Simulations are used to check the finite-sample performance of these tests as well as their power properties with respect to various alternative scenarios. The application and interpretation of the tests in practice are illustrated by an environmental data example.]]></summary>

We study chaotic dynamics in a system of four differential equations describing the interaction of five identical phase oscillators coupled via biharmonic function. We show that this system exhibits strange spiral attractors (Shilnikov attractors) with two zero (indistinguishable from zero in numerics) Lyapunov exponents in a wide region of the parameter space. We explain this phenomenon by means of bifurcation analysis of a three-dimensional Poincaré map for the system under consideration. We show that chaotic dynamics develop here near a codimension three bifurcation, when a periodic orbit (fixed point of the Poincaré map) has the triplet of multipliers [math]. As it is known, the flow normal form for such bifurcation is the well-known three-dimensional Arneodó–Coullet–Spiegel–Tresser (ACST) system, which exhibits spiral attractors. According to this, we conclude that the additional zero Lyapunov exponent for orbits in the observed attractors appears due to the fact that the corresponding three-dimensional Poincaré map is very close to the time-shift map of the ACST-system.]]></summary>

Existing tools for bifurcation detection from signals of dynamical systems typically are either limited to a special class of systems or they require carefully chosen input parameters and a significant expertise to interpret the results. Therefore, we describe an alternative method based on persistent homology—a tool from topological data analysis—that utilizes Betti numbers and CROCKER plots. Betti numbers are topological invariants of topological spaces, while the CROCKER plot is a coarsened but easy to visualize data representation of a one-parameter varying family of persistence barcodes. The specific bifurcations we investigate are transitions from periodic to chaotic behavior or vice versa in a one-parameter collection of differential equations. We validate our methods using numerical experiments on ten dynamical systems and contrast the results with existing tools that use the maximum Lyapunov exponent. We further prove the relationship between the Wasserstein distance to the empty diagram and the norm of the Betti vector, which shows that an even more simplified version of the information has the potential to provide insight into the bifurcation parameter. The results show that our approach reveals more information about the shape of the periodic attractor than standard tools, and it has more favorable computational time in comparison with the Rösenstein algorithm for computing the maximum Lyapunov exponent.]]></summary>

An efficient emotion recognition model is an important research branch in electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain–computer interfaces. However, the input of the emotion recognition model is often a whole set of EEG channels obtained by electrodes placed on subjects. The unnecessary information produced by redundant channels affects the recognition rate and depletes computing resources, thereby hindering the practical applications of emotion recognition. In this work, we aim to optimize the input of EEG channels using a visibility graph (VG) and genetic algorithm-based convolutional neural network (GA-CNN). First, we design an experiment to evoke three types of emotion states using movies and collect the multi-channel EEG signals of each subject under different emotion states. Then, we construct VGs for each EEG channel and derive nonlinear features representing each EEG channel. We employ the genetic algorithm (GA) to find the optimal subset of EEG channels for emotion recognition and use the recognition results of the CNN as fitness values. The experimental results show that the recognition performance of the proposed method using a subset of EEG channels is superior to that of the CNN using all channels for each subject. Last, based on the subset of EEG channels searched by the GA-CNN, we perform cross-subject emotion recognition tasks employing leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in recognizing emotion states using fewer EEG channels and further enrich the methods of EEG classification using nonlinear features.]]></summary>

The symmetry breaking of solitons in the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with cubic–quintic competing nonlinearity and parity-time symmetric potential is studied. At first, a new asymmetric branch separates from the fundamental symmetric soliton at the first power critical point, and then, the asymmetric branch passes through the branch of the fundamental symmetric soliton and finally merges into the branch of the fundamental symmetric soliton at the second power critical point, while the power of the soliton increases. This leads to the symmetry breaking and double-loop bifurcation of fundamental symmetric solitons. From the power-propagation constant curves of solitons, symmetric fundamental and tripole solitons, asymmetric solitons can also exist. The stability of symmetric fundamental solitons, asymmetric solitons, and symmetric tripole solitons is discussed by the linear stability analysis and direct simulation. Results indicate that symmetric fundamental solitons and symmetric tripole solitons tend to be stable with the increase in the soliton power. Asymmetric solitons are unstable in both high and low power regions. Moreover, with the increase in saturable nonlinearity, the stability region of fundamental symmetric solitons and symmetric tripole solitons becomes wider.]]></summary>

The cubic nonlinear Helmholtz equation with third and fourth order dispersion and non-Kerr nonlinearity, such as the self steepening and the self frequency shift, is considered. This model describes nonparaxial ultrashort pulse propagation in an optical medium in the presence of spatial dispersion originating from the failure of slowly varying envelope approximation. We show that this system admits periodic (elliptic) solitary waves with a dipole structure within a period and also a transition from a dipole to quadrupole structure within a period depending on the value of the modulus parameter of a Jacobi elliptic function. The parametric conditions to be satisfied for the existence of these solutions are given. The effect of the nonparaxial parameter on physical quantities, such as amplitude, pulse width, and speed of the solitary waves, is examined. It is found that by adjusting the nonparaxial parameter, the speed of solitary waves can be decelerated. The stability and robustness of the solitary waves are discussed numerically.]]></summary>

Motion is a typical reaction among animals and humans trying to reach better conditions in a changing world. This aspect has been studied intensively in social dilemmas where competing players’ individual and collective interests are in conflict. Starting from the traditional public goods game model, where players are locally fixed and unconditional cooperators or defectors are present, we introduce two additional strategies through which agents can change their positions of dependence on the local cooperation level. More importantly, these so-called sophisticated players should bear an extra cost to maintain their permanent capacity to evaluate their neighborhood and react accordingly. Hence, four strategies compete, and the most successful one can be imitated by its neighbors. Crucially, the introduction of costly movement has a highly biased consequence on the competing main strategies. In the majority of parameter space, it is harmful to defectors and provides a significantly higher cooperation level when the population is rare. At an intermediate population density, which would be otherwise optimal for a system of immobile players, the presence of mobile actors could be detrimental if the interaction pattern changes slightly, thereby blocking the optimal percolation of information flow. In this parameter space, sophisticated cooperators can also show the co-called Moor effect by first avoiding the harmful vicinity of defectors; they subsequently transform into an immobile cooperator state. Hence, paradoxically, the additional cost of movement could be advantageous to reach a higher general income, especially for a rare population when subgroups would be isolated otherwise.]]></summary>

Despite their simplicity, networks of coupled phase oscillators can give rise to intriguing collective dynamical phenomena. However, the symmetries of globally and identically coupled identical units do not allow solutions where distinct oscillators are frequency-unlocked—a necessary condition for the emergence of chimeras. Thus, forced symmetry breaking is necessary to observe chimera-type solutions. Here, we consider the bifurcations that arise when full permutational symmetry is broken for the network to consist of coupled populations. We consider the smallest possible network composed of four phase oscillators and elucidate the phase space structure, (partial) integrability for some parameter values, and how the bifurcations away from full symmetry lead to frequency-unlocked weak chimera solutions. Since such solutions wind around a torus they must arise in a global bifurcation scenario. Moreover, periodic weak chimeras undergo a period-doubling cascade leading to chaos.

Memristor-based neuromorphic systems have a neuro-bionic function, which is critical for possibly overcoming Moore's law limitation and the von Neumann bottleneck problem. To explore neural behaviors and complexity mechanisms in memristive circuits, this paper proposes an N-type locally active memristor, based on which a third-order memristive circuit is constructed. Theoretical analysis shows that the memristive circuit can exhibit not only various action potentials but also self-sustained oscillation and chaos. Based on Chua's theory of local activity, this paper finds that the neural behaviors and chaos emerge near the edge of chaos through subcritical Hopf bifurcation, in which the small unstable limit cycle is depicted by the dividing line between the attraction basin of the large stable limit cycle and the attraction basin of the stable equilibrium point. Furthermore, an analog circuit is designed to imitate the action potentials and chaos, and the simulation results are in agreement with the theoretical analysis.]]></summary>

Effective strategies of vaccine prioritization are essential to mitigate the impacts of severe infectious diseases. We investigate the role of infection fatality ratio (IFR) and social contact matrices on vaccination prioritization using a compartmental epidemic model fueled by real-world data of different diseases and countries. Our study confirms that massive and early vaccination is extremely effective to reduce the disease fatality if the contagion is mitigated, but the effectiveness is increasingly reduced as vaccination beginning delays in an uncontrolled epidemiological scenario. The optimal and least effective prioritization strategies depend non-linearly on epidemiological variables. Regions of the epidemiological parameter space, in which prioritizing the most vulnerable population is more effective than the most contagious individuals, depend strongly on the IFR age profile being, for example, substantially broader for COVID-19 in comparison with seasonal influenza. Demographics and social contact matrices deform the phase diagrams but do not alter their qualitative shapes.]]></summary>
