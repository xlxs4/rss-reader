We present a finite element discretization scheme for multidimensional fractional diffusion problems with spatially varying diffusivity and fractional order. We consider the symmetric integral form of these nonlocal equations defined on general geometries and in arbitrary bounded domains. A number of challenges are encountered when discretizing these equations. The first comes from the heterogeneous kernel singularity in the fractional integral operator. The second comes from the formally dense discrete operator with its quadratic growth in memory footprint and arithmetic operations. An additional challenge comes from the need to handle volume conditions—the generalization of classical local boundary conditions to the nonlocal setting. Satisfying these conditions requires that the…]]></summary>

 Abstract. Sampling the phase space of molecular systems—and, more generally, of complex systems effectively modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDEs)—is a crucial modeling step in many fields, from protein folding to materials discovery. These problems are often multiscale in nature: they can be described in terms of low-dimensional effective free energy surfaces parametrized by a small number of “slow” reaction coordinates; the remaining “fast” degrees of freedom populate an equilibrium measure conditioned on the reaction coordinate values. Sampling procedures for such problems are used to estimate effective free energy differences as well as ensemble averages with respect to the conditional …]]></summary>

 Abstract. The extinction of species is a major problem of concern with a large literature. We investigate a differential equations model for population interactions with the goal of determining when several species (i.e., coordinates of a bounded solution) must die out or “go extinct” and must do so exponentially fast. Typically each coordinate represents the population density of a different species. For our main tool, we create what we call “die-out” Lyapunov functions. A given system may have several or many such functions, each of which is a function of a different set of coordinates. That die-out function implies that one of the species in its subset must die out exponentially fast—for almost every choice of coefficients of the system. We create a “team” of die-out functions that work together to show that [math] species must die, where [math] is determined separately. Second, we present a “trophic” condition for generalized Lotka–Volterra systems that guarantees that there is a trapping region that is globally attracting. That implies that all solutions are bounded.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Reaction-diffusion models with nonlocal constraints naturally arise as limiting cases of coupled bulk-surface models of intracellular signalling. In this paper, a minimal, mass-conserving model of cell-polarization on a curved membrane is analyzed in the limit of slow surface diffusion. Using the tools of formal asymptotics and calculus of variations, we study the characteristic wave-pinning behavior of this system on three dynamical timescales. On the short timescale, generation of an interface separating high- and low-concentration domains is established under suitable conditions. Intermediate timescale dynamics are shown to lead to a uniform growth or shrinking of these domains to sizes that are fixed by global parameters. Finally, the long timescale dynamics reduce to area-preserving geodesic curvature flow that may lead to multi-interface steady state solutions. These results provide a foundation for studying cell polarization and related phenomena in biologically relevant geometries.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper proposes a new mathematical formulation for flow measurement based on the inverse source problem for wave equations with partial boundary measurement. Inspired by the design of acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), we formulate an inverse source problem that can recover the flow field from the observation data on boundary receivers. To our knowledge, this is the first mathematical model of flow measurement using partial differential equations. This model is proved well-posed, and the corresponding algorithm is derived to compute the velocity field efficiently. Extensive numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our model. The comparison results demonstrate that our model is ten times more accurate than ADCP. Our formulation is capable of simulating a variety of practical measurement scenarios.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Modern applications of graph algorithms often involve the use of the output sets (usually, a subset of edges or vertices of the input graph) as inputs to other algorithms. Since the input graphs of interest are large and dynamic, it is desirable for an algorithm’s output to not change drastically when a few random edges are removed from the input graph, so as to prevent issues in postprocessing. Alternately, having such a guarantee also means that one can revise the solution obtained by running the algorithm on the original graph in just a few places in order to obtain a solution for the new graph. We formalize this feature by introducing the notion of average sensitivity of graph algorithms, which is t…]]></summary>

Simplicial complexes are generalizations of classical graphs. Their homology groups are widely used to characterize the structure and the topology of data in e.g. chemistry, neuroscience, and transportation networks. In this work we assume we are given a simplicial complex and that we can act on its underlying graph, formed by the set of 1-simplices, and we investigate the stability of its homology with respect to perturbations of the edges in such graph. Precisely, exploiting the isomorphism between the homology groups and the higher-order Laplacian operators, we propose a numerical method to compute the smallest graph perturbation sufficient to change the dimension of the simplex’s Hodge homology. Our approach is based on a matrix nearness problem formulated as a matrix differential equation, which requires an appropriate weighting and normalizing procedure for the boundary operators acting on the Hodge algebra’s homology groups. We develop a bilevel optimization procedure suitable for the formulated matrix nearness problem and illustrate the method’s performance on a variety of synthetic quasi-triangulation datasets and real-world transportation networks.]]></summary>

The polyhedral projection problem arises in various applications. To efficiently solve the dual problem, one of the crucial issues is to safely identify zero-elements as well as the signs of nonzero elements at the optimal solution. In this paper, relying on its nonsmooth dual problem and active set techniques, we first propose a Duality-Gap-Active-Set strategy (DGASS) to effectively identify the indices of zero-elements and the signs of nonzero entries of the optimal solution. Serving as an efficient acceleration strategy, DGASS can be embedded into certain iterative methods. In particular, by applying DGASS to both the proximal gradient algorithm (PGA) and the proximal semismooth Newton algorithm (PSNA), we propose the method of PGA-DGASS and PSNA-DGASS, respectively. Global convergence and local quadratic convergence rate are discussed. We report on numerical results over both synthetic and real data sets to demonstrate the high efficiency of the two DGASS-accelerated methods.]]></summary>

We generalize the idea of relaxation time stepping methods in order to preserve multiple nonlinear conserved quantities of a dynamical system by projecting along directions defined by multiple time stepping algorithms. Similar to the directional projection method of Calvo et. al. we use embedded Runge–Kutta methods to facilitate this in a computationally efficient manner. Proof of the accuracy of the modified RK methods and the existence of valid relaxation parameters are given, under some restrictions. Among other examples, we apply this technique to Implicit–Explicit Runge–Kutta time integration for the Korteweg–de Vries equation and investigate the feasibility and effect of conserving multiple invariants for multi-soliton solutions.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Twisted bilayer graphene gives rise to large moiré patterns that form a triangular network upon mechanical relaxation. If gating is included, each triangular region has gapped electronic Dirac points that behave as bulk topological insulators with topological indices depending on valley index and the type of stacking. Since each triangle has two oppositely charged valleys, they remain topologically trivial. In this work, we address several questions related to the edge currents of this system by analysis and computation of continuum PDE models. First, we derive the bulk invariants corresponding to a single valley, and then apply a bulk-interface correspondence to quantify asymmetric transport along the interface. Second, we introduce a valley-coupled continuum model to show how valleys are approximately decoupled in the presence of small perturbations using a multiscale expansion, and how valleys couple for larger defects. Third, we present a method to prove for a large class of continuum (pseudo)differential models that a quantized asymmetric current is preserved through a junction such as a triangular network vertex. We support all of these arguments with numerical simulations using spectral methods to compute relevant currents and wave packet propagation.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This manuscript is aimed at addressing several long-standing limitations of dynamic mode decomposition in the application of Koopman analysis. Principal among these limitations are the convergence of associated dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) algorithms and the existence of Koopman modes. To address these limitations, two major modifications are made, where Koopman operators are removed from the analysis in light of Liouville operators (known as Koopman generators in special cases), and these operators are shown to be compact for certain pairs of Hilbert spaces selected separately as the domain and range of the operator. While eigenfunctions are discarded in the general analysis, a viable reconstruction algorithm is still demonstrated, and the sacrifice of eigenfunctions realizes the theoretical goals of DMD analysis that have yet to be achieved in other contexts. However, in the case where the domain is embedded in the range, an eigenfunction approach is still achievable, where a more typical DMD routine is established, but that leverages a finite rank representation that converges in norm. The manuscript concludes with the description of two DMD algorithms that converge when a dense collection of occupation kernels, arising from the data, are leveraged in the analysis.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This work studies front formation in the Allen–Cahn equation with a parameter heterogeneity which slowly varies in space. In particular, we consider a heterogeneity which mediates the local stability of the zero state and subsequent pitchfork bifurcation to a nontrivial state. For slowly varying ramps which are either rigidly propagating in time or stationary, we rigorously establish existence and stability of positive, monotone fronts and give leading order expansions for their interface location. For nonzero ramp speeds, and sufficiently small ramp slopes, the front location is determined by the local transition between convective and absolute instability of the base state and leads to an [math] delay beyond the instantaneous pitchfork location before the system jumps to a nontrivial state. The slow ramp induces a further delay of the interface controlled by a slow passage through a fold of strong- and weak-stable eigenspaces of the associated linearization. We introduce projective coordinates to desingularize the dynamics near the trivial state and track relevant invariant manifolds all the way to the fold point. We then use geometric singular perturbation theory and blow-up techniques to locate the desired intersection of invariant manifolds. For stationary ramps, the front is governed by the slow passage through the instantaneous pitchfork bifurcation with inner expansion given by the unique Hastings–McLeod connecting solution of Painlevé’s second equation. We once again use geometric singular perturbation theory and blow-up techniques to track invariant manifolds into a neighborhood of the nonhyperbolic point where the ramp passes through zero and to locate intersections.]]></summary>

We propose two spatial second-order schemes for linear radiative transfer equations by using the idea of the unified gas kinetic scheme (UGKS) to construct the numerical boundary fluxes, and show that the proposed schemes are both positive and asymptotic preserving. The UGKS was proposed by Xu and Huang (J Comput Phys 229:7747–7764, 2010) for continuum and rarefied flows firstly, and was then applied to a linear radiative transfer equation by Mieussens in (J Comput Phys 253:138–156, 2013) where the asymptotic preserving property of UGKS is shown. Although it is asymptotic preserving, UGKS can not always keep the positivity of solutions. We first apply UGKS to discretize a linear radiative transfer equation to have a spatial second-order scheme. Then, by a detailed analysis of the numerical boundary fluxes, we are able to find the reasons why the positive preserving property of UGKS fails. Finally, we carefully employ a linear scaling limiter and a flux correction to make UGKS positive-preserving but still asymptotic-preserving. Consequently, we propose two spatial second-order positive and asymptotic preserving unified gas kinetic schemes for the linear radiative transfer equation, thus improving the earlier work (J Comput Phys 444:110546, 2021) where only a first-order positive and asymptotic scheme is developed. The proposed schemes can well capture the solution of the diffusion limit equation in optically thick regions without requiring the cell size being smaller than the photon’s mean free path, while the solution in optically thin regions can also be well resolved in a natural way. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that a spatial second-order positive and asymptotic preserving gas kinetic scheme for linear radiative transfer equations is constructed. Several numerical experiments are included to validate the spatial second-order accuracy, positive- and asymptotic-preserving properties of the proposed schemes.]]></summary>

Linear inverse problems arise in diverse engineering fields especially in signal and image reconstruction. The development of computational methods for linear inverse problems with sparsity is one of the recent trends in this field. The so-called optimal k-thresholding is a newly introduced method for sparse optimization and linear inverse problems. Compared to other sparsity-aware algorithms, the advantage of optimal k-thresholding method lies in that it performs thresholding and error metric reduction simultaneously and thus works stably and robustly for solving medium-sized linear inverse problems. However, the runtime of this method is generally high when the size of the problem is large. The purpose of this paper is to propose an acceleration strategy for this method. Specifically, we propose a heavy-ball-based optimal k-thresholding algorithm and its relaxed variants for sparse linear inverse problems. The convergence of these algorithms is shown under the restricted isometry property. In addition, the numerical performance of the heavy-ball-based relaxed optimal k-thresholding pursuit (HBROTP) has been evaluated, and simulations indicate that HBROTP admits robustness for signal and image reconstruction even in noisy environments.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) and force fields (i.e., interaction laws for atoms and molecules) are typically trained on limited data-sets that cover only a very small section of the full space of possible input structures. MLIPs are nevertheless capable of making accurate predictions of forces and energies in simulations involving (seemingly) much more complex structures. In this article we propose a framework within which this kind of generalization can be rigorously understood. As a prototypical example, we apply the framework to the case of simulating point defects in a crystalline solid. Here, we demonstrate how the accuracy of the simulation depends explicitly on the size of the training structures, on the kind of observations (e.g., energies, forces, force constants, virials) to which the model has been fitted, and on the fit accuracy. The new theoretical insights we gain partially justify current best practices in the MLIP literature and in addition suggest a new approach to the collection of training data and the design of loss functions.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the complexity of local graph-centrality estimation, with the goal of approximating the centrality score of a given target node while exploring only a sublinear number of nodes/arcs of the graph and performing a sublinear number of elementary operations. We develop a technique, which we apply to PageRank and Heat Kernel, for constructing a low-variance score estimator through a local exploration of the graph. We obtain an algorithm that, given any node in any graph of [math] nodes and [math] arcs, with probability [math] computes a multiplicative [math]-approximation of its score by examining only [math] nodes/arcs, where [math] is the maximum outdegree of the graph and [math] and [math] factors are omitted for readability. A similar bound holds for computational cost. We also prove a lower bound of [math] for both query complexity and computational complexity. Moreover, in the jump-and-crawl graph-access model, our technique yields a [math]-queries algorithm; we show that this algorithm is optimal up to a logarithmic factor—in fact, sublogarithmic in the case of PageRank. These are the first algorithms with sublinear worst-case bounds for general directed graphs and any choice of the target node.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) is a recent technique that gives a unified framework to describe most quantum algorithms discovered so far, and may lead to the development of novel quantum algorithms. In this paper we investigate the hardness of classically simulating the QSVT. A recent result by Chia et al. [Sampling-based sublinear low-rank matrix arithmetic framework for dequantizing quantum machine learning, in Proceedings of the 52nd Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2020), 2020, pp. 387–400] showed that the QSVT can be efficiently “dequantized” for low-rank matrices, and discussed its implication to quantum machine learning. In this work, motivated by establ…]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this work we propose a model that represents the relation between fish ponds, the mosquito population and the transmission of malaria. It has been observed that in the Amazonic region of Acre, in the North of Brazil, fish farming is correlated to the transmission of malaria when carried out in artificial ponds that become breeding sites. Evidence has been found indicating that cleaning the vegetation from the edges of the crop tanks helps to control the size of the mosquito population. We use our model to determine the effective contribution of fish farming practices on malaria transmission dynamics. The model consists of a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations with jumps at the cleaning time, which act as impulsive controls. We study the asymptotic behavior of the system in function of the intensity and periodicity of the cleaning, and the value of the parameters. In particular, we state sufficient conditions under which the mosquito population is eliminated or persists, and under which the malaria is eliminated or becomes endemic. We prove our conditions by applying results for cooperative systems with concave nonlinearities.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Many biological systems can be modeled as a chemical reaction network with unknown parameters. Data available to identify these parameters are often in the form of a stationary distribution, such as that obtained from measurements of a cell population. In this work, we introduce a framework for analyzing the identifiability of the reaction rate coefficients of chemical reaction networks from stationary distribution data. Working with the linear noise approximation, which is a diffusive approximation to the chemical master equation, we give a computational procedure to certify global identifiability based on Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz. We present a variety of examples that show the applicability of our method to chemical reaction networks of interest in systems and synthetic biology, including discrimination between possible molecular mechanisms for the interaction between biochemical species.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We formulate an effective numerical scheme that can readily, and accurately, calculate the dynamics of weakly interacting multi-pulse solutions of the quintic complex Ginzburg–Landau equation (QCGLE) in one space dimension. The scheme is based on a global center-manifold reduction where one considers the solution of the QCGLE as the composition of individual pulses plus a remainder function, which is orthogonal to the adjoint eigenfunctions of the linearized operator about a single pulse. This center-manifold projection overcomes the difficulties of other, more orthodox, numerical schemes, by yielding a fast-slow system describing “slow” ordinary differential equations for the locations and phases of the individual pulses, and a “fast” partial differential equation for the remainder function. With small parameter [math] where [math] is a constant and [math] is the minimal pulse separation distance, we write the fast-slow system in terms of first-order and second-order correction terms only, a formulation which is solved more efficiently than the full system. This fast-slow system is integrated numerically using adaptive time-stepping. Results are presented here for two- and three-pulse interactions. For the two-pulse problem, cells of periodic behavior, separated by an infinite set of heteroclinic orbits, are shown to “split” under perturbation creating complex spiral behavior. For the case of three-pulse interaction a range of dynamics, including chaotic pulse interaction, is found. While results are presented for pulse interaction in the QCGLE, the numerical scheme can also be applied to a wider class of parabolic PDEs.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We develop a framework to design optimal entrainment signals that entrain an ensemble of heterogeneous nonlinear oscillators, described by phase models, at desired phases. We explicitly take into account heterogeneity in both oscillation frequency and the type of oscillators characterized by different phase response curves. The central idea is to leverage the Fourier series representation of periodic functions to decode a phase-selective entrainment task into a quadratic program. We demonstrate our approach using a variety of phase models where we entrain the oscillators into distinct phase patterns. Also, we show how the generalizability gained from our formulation enables us to meet a wide range of design objectives and constraints, such as minimum-power, fast entrainment, and charge-balanced controls.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A positively invariant ball and a global attractor for the porous media lattice system are obtained. By the implicit Euler scheme, the continuous-time model is discretized as a discrete-time porous media lattice system, which generates a discrete semigroup on the positively invariant ball for sufficiently small step sizes. It is shown that the discrete semigroup has a numerical attractor, which converges upper semicontinuously to the global attractor as the step size tends to zero. A new subject on enlarged attractors for lattice systems is investigated, which includes unique existence and convergence of attractors as well as solutions on the larger initial space. The second-order Taylor expansion and discretization error on the enlarged regular space are established to prove the upper semicontinuity of the enlarged numerical attractors with respect to the step size, while an upper bound of the enlarged attractors is provided to establish the lower semicontinuity in special cases.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We consider a stochastic partial differential equation close to bifurcation of pitchfork type, where a one-dimensional space changes its stability. For finite-time Lyapunov exponents we characterize regions depending on the distance from bifurcation and the noise strength where finite-time Lyapunov exponents are positive and thus detect bifurcations. One technical tool is the reduction of the essential dynamics of the infinite-dimensional stochastic system to a simple ordinary stochastic differential equation, which is valid close to the bifurcation.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This work presents a mathematical theory for electromagnetic scattering resonances in a subwavelength annular hole embedded in a metallic slab, with the annulus width [math]. The model is representative among many 3D subwavelength hole structures, which are able to induce resonant scattering of electromagnetic wave and the so-called extraordinary optical transmission. We develop a multiscale framework for the underlying scattering problem based upon a combination of the integral equation in the exterior domain and the waveguide mode expansion inside the tiny hole. The matching of the electromagnetic field over the hole aperture leads to a sequence of decoupled infinite systems, which are used to set up the resonance conditions for the scattering problem. By performing rigorous analysis for the infinite systems and the resonance conditions, we characterize all the resonances in a bounded domain over the complex plane. It is shown that the resonances are associated with the transverse electric (TE) and transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waveguide modes in the annular hole, and they are close to the real axis with the imaginary parts of order [math]. We also investigate resonant scattering when an incident wave is present. It is proved that the electromagnetic field is amplified with order [math] at the resonant frequencies that are associated with the TE modes in the annular hole. On the other hand, one particular resonance associated with the TEM mode cannot be excited by a plane wave but can be excited with a near-field electric dipole source, leading to field enhancement of order [math].]]></summary>

 Abstract. The task of modeling and forecasting a dynamical system is one of the oldest problems, and it remains challenging. Broadly, this task has two subtasks: extracting the full dynamical information from a partial observation, and then explicitly learning the dynamics from this information. We present a mathematical framework in which the dynamical information is represented in the form of an embedding. The framework combines the two subtasks using the language of spaces, maps, and commutations. The framework also unifies two of the most common learning paradigms: delay-coordinates and reservoir computing. We use this framework as a platform for two other investigations of the reconstructed system, its dynamical stability and the growth of error under iterations. We show that these questions are deeply tied to more fundamental properties of the underlying system, i.e., the behavior of matrix cocycles over the base dynamics, its nonuniform hyperbolic behavior, and its decay of correlations. Thus, our framework bridges the gap between universally observed behavior of dynamics modeling and the spectral, differential, and ergodic properties intrinsic to the dynamics.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The stability analysis of synchronization in time-varying higher-order networked structures (simplicial complexes) is a challenging problem due to the presence of time-varying group interactions. In this context, most of the previous studies have been done either on temporal pairwise networks or on static simplicial complexes. Here, for the first time, we propose a general framework to study the synchronization phenomenon in temporal simplicial complexes. We show that the synchronous state exists as an invariant solution and obtain the necessary condition for it to emerge as a stable state in the fast-switching regime. We prove that the time-averaged simplicial complex plays the role of synchronization indicator whenever the switching among simplicial topologies is adequately fast. We attempt to transform the stability problem into a master stability function form. Unfortunately, for the general circumstances, the dimension reduction of the master stability equation is cumbersome due to the presence of group interactions. However, we overcome this difficulty in two interesting situations based on either the functional forms of the coupling schemes or the connectivity structure of the simplicial complex, and we demonstrate that the necessary condition mimics the form of a master stability function in these cases. We verify our analytical findings by applying them on synthetic and real-world networked systems. We find that the presence of temporality along with the multiway interactions improves the synchronization phenomena as compared to the static higher-ordered or temporal pairwise system. In addition, our results also reveal that with sufficient higher-order coupling and adequately fast rewiring, the temporal simplicial complex achieves synchrony even in a very low connectivity regime.]]></summary>

In this paper, a new class of spectral volume (SV) methods are proposed, analyzed, and implemented for diffusion equations, with the viscous flux taken as an interior penalty or direct discontinuous Galerkin formulation. The control volumes are constructed by using four kinds of special points (including Legendre–Gauss, Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto, right Legendre–Gauss–Radau and left Legendre–Gauss–Radau points) in subintervals of the underlying meshes, which leads to four different SV schemes. A framework for the stability analysis and error estimates of the four SV schemes is established. In particular, the influence of the choice of the parameters in the numerical fluxes on the convergence rate and the optimal choices of coefficients for each SV scheme are discussed and provided. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the four SV schemes for both linear and nonlinear diffusion equations.]]></summary>

In this paper, we concentrate on the robust tensor completion (RTC) problem, which aims to recover a low-rank tensor from partial observations corrupted by sparse noise. Most existing methods for RTC utilize the tensor nuclear norm (TNN) to evaluate the tensor rank. However, the TNN often yields biased solutions due to its loose approximation for the tensor rank. To solve this problem, we derive a unified non-convex surrogate that better approximates the tensor rank. Our surrogate is composed of several non-convex penalty functions. Further, we propose a generalized non-convex model, which minimizes a weighted combination of the unified non-convex surrogate and the

Moreover, we prove the sequence generated by the PADCF algorithm converges to the critical point under some mild conditions. Numerical experiments are provided for illustrations and comparisons.]]></summary>

We present a meshfree collocation scheme to discretize intrinsic surface differential operators over scalar fields on smooth curved surfaces with given normal vectors and a non-intersecting tubular neighborhood. The method is based on discretization-corrected particle strength exchange (DC-PSE), which generalizes finite difference methods to meshfree point clouds. The proposed Surface DC-PSE method is derived from an embedding theorem, but we analytically reduce the operator kernels along surface normals to obtain a purely intrinsic computational scheme over surface point clouds. We benchmark Surface DC-PSE by discretizing the Laplace–Beltrami operator on a circle and a sphere, and we present convergence results for both explicit and implicit solvers. We then showcase the algorithm on the problem of computing Gauss and mean curvature of an ellipsoid and of the Stanford Bunny by approximating the intrinsic divergence of the normal vector field. Finally, we compare Surface DC-PSE with surface finite elements (SFEM) and diffuse-interface finite elements (DI FEM) in a validation case.]]></summary>

The multilayer model proposed in this paper is a generalization of the multilayer non-hydrostatic model for shallow granular flows (Fernández-Nieto et al in Commun Math Sci 16(5):1169–1202, 2018. https://doi.org/10.4310/cms.2018.v16.n5.a1), the multilayer model with

We show that the proposed model verifies a dissipative energy balance. A well-balanced numerical scheme is proposed to solve the equations based on a projection method and a hydrostatic reconstruction for the Coulomb friction terms. In order to reduce the computational cost associated with solving the linear system of the projection method, a precomputing of the initial guess for an iterative solver is proposed. This strategy allows us to reduce the computational time by around 70

                     when 20 layers are considered. In the numerical tests, we show that the proposed model can recover the in-depth velocity profiles typically observed in lab experiments and capture the flow/no-flow interface that appears in granular avalanches. During the initial stage of granular collapse simulations, the model is shown to improve the approximation of the mass profiles compared to other models and to predict the parabolic shape of the front velocity evolution with time, as observed in lab experiments. Interestingly, our numerical tests show that the ability of the granular flow to overcome obstacles strongly depends on the model used, which is of strong interest for landslide hazard assessment.]]></summary>

This paper introduces a conjugate gradients (CG) acceleration of the coordinate descent algorithm (CD) for linear systems. It is shown that the Kaczmarz algorithm (KACZ) can simulate CD exactly, so CD can be accelerated by CG similarly to the CG acceleration of KACZ (Björck and Elfving in BIT 19:145–163, 1979). Experimental results were carried out on large sets of problems of reconstructing bandlimited functions from random sampling. The randomness causes extreme variance between different instances of these problems, thus causing extreme variance in the advantage of CGCD over CD. The reduction of the number of iterations by CGCD varies from about 50–90% and beyond. The implementation of CGCD is simple. CGCD can also be used for the parallel solution of linear systems derived from partial differential equations, and for the efficient solution of multiple right-hand-side problems and matrix inversion.]]></summary>

We consider frictional contact problems in small strain elasticity discretized with finite elements and Nitsche method. Both bilateral and unilateral contact problems are taken into account, as well as both Tresca and Coulomb friction models. We derive residual a posteriori error estimates for each friction model, following (Chouly et al., in IMA J Numer Anal 38: 921–954, 2018). For the incomplete variant of Nitsche, we prove an upper bound for the dual norm of the residual, for Tresca and Coulomb friction, without any extra regularity and without a saturation assumption. We prove also local lower bounds. Numerical experiments allow to assess the accuracy of the estimates and their interest for adaptive meshing in different situations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Multisite phosphorylation is a signaling mechanism well known to give rise to multiple steady states, a property termed multistationarity. When phosphorylation occurs in a sequential and distributive manner, we obtain a family of networks indexed by the number of phosphorylation sites [math]. This work addresses the problem of understanding the parameter region where this family of networks displays multistationarity, by focusing on the projection of this region onto the set of kinetic parameters. The problem is phrased in the context of real algebraic geometry and reduced to studying whether a polynomial, defined as the determinant of a parametric matrix of size three, attains negative values over the positive orthant. The coefficients of the polynomial are functions of the kinetic parameters. For any [math], we provide sufficient conditions for the polynomial to be positive and, hence, preclude multistationarity, and also sufficient conditions for it to attain negative values and, hence, enable multistationarity. These conditions are derived by exploiting the structure of the polynomial and its Newton polytope and employing circuit polynomials. A relevant consequence of our results is that the sets of kinetic parameters that enable or preclude multistationarity are both connected for all [math].]]></summary>

 Abstract. For a mechanical system consisting of a rotator and a pendulum coupled via a small, time-periodic Hamiltonian perturbation, the Arnold diffusion problem asserts the existence of “diffusing orbits” along which the energy of the rotator grows by an amount independent of the size of the coupling parameter, for all sufficiently small values of the coupling parameter. There is a vast literature on establishing Arnold diffusion for such systems. In this work, we consider the case when an additional, dissipative perturbation is added to the rotator-pendulum system with coupling. Therefore, the system obtained is not symplectic but conformally symplectic. We provide explicit conditions on the dissipation parameter, so that the resulting system still exhibits energy growth. The fact that Arnold diffusion may play a role in systems with small dissipation was conjectured by Chirikov. In this work, the coupling is carefully chosen, but the mechanism we present can be adapted to general couplings, and we will deal with the general case in future work.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A unified method for analyzing the dynamics and topological structure associated with a class of Floquet topological insulators is presented. The method is applied to a system that describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves through the bulk of a two-dimensional lattice that is helically driven in the direction of propagation. Tight-binding approximations are employed to derive reduced dynamical systems. Further asymptotic approximations, valid in the high-frequency driving regime, yield a time-averaged system which governs the leading order behavior of the wave. From this follows an analytic calculation of the Berry connection, curvature, and Chern number via analyzing the local behavior of the eigenfunctions near the critical points of the spectrum. Examples include honeycomb, Lieb, kagome, and 1/5-depleted lattices. In the nonlinear regime, novel equations governing slowly varying wave envelopes are derived. For the honeycomb lattice, numerical simulations show that for relatively small nonlinear effects a striking spiral pattern occurs; as nonlinearity increases, localized structures emerge, and for somewhat higher nonlinearity the waves appear to collapse.]]></summary>

We design a monotone meshfree finite difference method for linear elliptic equations in the non-divergence form on point clouds via a nonlocal relaxation method. The key idea is a novel combination of a nonlocal integral relaxation of the PDE problem with a robust meshfree discretization on point clouds. Minimal positive stencils are obtained through a local

                    -type optimization procedure that automatically guarantees the stability and, therefore, the convergence of the meshfree discretization for linear elliptic equations. A major theoretical contribution is the existence of consistent and positive stencils for a given point cloud geometry. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of positive stencils by finding neighbors within an ellipse (2d) or ellipsoid (3d) surrounding each interior point, generalizing the study for Poisson’s equation by Seibold (Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 198(3–4):592–601, 2008). It is well-known that wide stencils are in general needed for constructing consistent and monotone finite difference schemes for linear elliptic equations. Our result represents a significant improvement in the stencil width estimate for positive-type finite difference methods for linear elliptic equations in the near-degenerate regime (when the ellipticity constant becomes small), compared to previously known works in this area. Numerical algorithms and practical guidance are provided with an eye on the case of small ellipticity constant. At the end, we present numerical results for the performance of our method in both 2d and 3d, examining a range of ellipticity constants including the near-degenerate regime.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study traveling wave solutions to bistable differential equations on infinite k-ary trees. These graphs generalize the notion of classical square infinite lattices and our results complement those for bistable lattice equations on [math]. Using comparison principles and explicit lower and upper solutions, we show that wave solutions are pinned for small diffusion parameters. Upon increasing the diffusion, the wave starts to travel with nonzero speed, in a direction that depends on the detuning parameter. However, once the diffusion is sufficiently strong, the wave propagates in a single direction up the tree irrespective of the detuning parameter. In particular, our results imply that changes to the diffusion parameter can lead to a reversal of the propagation direction.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Classical gene expression models assume exponential switching time distributions between the active and inactive promoter states. However, recent experiments have shown that many genes in mammalian cells may produce nonexponential switching time distributions, implying the existence of multiple promoter states and molecular memory in the promoter switching dynamics. Here we analytically solve a gene expression model with random bursting and complex promoter switching, and derive the time-dependent distributions of the mRNA and protein copy numbers, generalizing the steady-state solution obtained in [T. Zhou and J. Zhang, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 72 (2012), pp. 789–818] and [U. Herbach, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 79 (2019), pp. 1007–1029]. Using multiscale simplification techniques, we find that molecular memory has no influence on the time-dependent distribution when promoter switching is very fast or very slow, while it significantly affects the distribution when promoter switching is neither too fast nor too slow. By analyzing the dynamical phase diagram of the system, we also find that molecular memory in the inactive gene state weakens transient and stationary bimodality of the copy number distribution, while molecular memory in the active gene state enhances such bimodality.]]></summary>

 Abstract. When ions are crowded, the effect of steric repulsion between ions (which can produce oscillations in charge density profiles) becomes significant and the conventional Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) equation should be modified. Several modified PB equations were developed but the associated total ionic charge density has no oscillation. This motivates us to derive a general model of PB equations called the PB-steric equations with a parameter [math], which not only include the conventional and modified PB equations but also have oscillatory total ionic charge density under different assumptions of steric effects and chemical potentials. As [math], the PB-steric equation becomes the conventional PB equation, but as [math], the concentrations of ions and solvent molecules are determined by the Lambert type functions. To approach the modified PB equations, we study the asymptotic limit of PB-steric equations with the Robin boundary condition as [math] goes to infinity. Our theoretical results show that the PB-steric equations (for [math]) may include the conventional and modified PB equations. On the other hand, we use the PB-steric equations to find oscillatory total ionic charge density which cannot be obtained in the conventional and modified PB equations.]]></summary>

This work focuses on the robust and high-order numerical simulations of weakly compressible two-phase flows by using the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method combined with an explicit strong-stability-preserving Runge–Kutta scheme. In order to improve the computational robustness under large density ratios, a nonlinear weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) limiter and a positivity-preserving limiter are specially designed and applied with the aim of dampening the nonphysical oscillations around the phase interface and preventing the occurrence of negative density, respectively. More importantly, we theoretically prove that the present method is able to satisfy the uniform-pressure–velocity criterion which states that uniform pressure and velocity profiles around an isolated phase interface should be preserved during the simulation. The performance of the present method is validated by a range of benchmark test cases with density ratios up to 1000:1. The results demonstrate that the present method possesses a good capability of simulating weakly compressible two-phase flows with large density ratios.]]></summary>
