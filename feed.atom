        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Viruses have evolved the ability to bind and enter cells through interactions with a wide variety of host cell macromolecules. Here, we screened for AAV capsids that bind two host cell proteins expressed on the mouse blood-brain barrier, LY6A or the related protein LY6C1. Introducing interactions with either protein target generated hundreds of capsids with dramatically enhanced central nervous system (CNS) tropisms. In contrast to the AAV-PHP.B capsid family, which interacts with LY6A and only exhibits its enhanced CNS tropism in a subset of mouse strains, the capsids that engage LY6C1 maintain their CNS tropism in BALB/cJ mice. Compared to conventional in vivo screens for CNS cell transducing capsids, a single round of protein target binding screening recovered significantly more capsids with enhanced performance that were validated in subsequent in vivo screens. Moreover, the initial screening round generated reproducible and quantitative target binding data that enabled the efficient machine learning-guided generation of more diverse targetspecific capsids. This work demonstrates that AAV capsids can be directly targeted to specific proteins to generate potent gene delivery vectors with known mechanisms of action and predictable tropisms.]]></summary>

We revisit the problem of diffusion in a driven system consisting of an inertial Brownian particle moving in a symmetric periodic potential and subjected to a symmetric time-periodic force. We reveal parameter domains in which diffusion is normal in the long time limit and exhibits intriguing giant damped quasiperiodic oscillations as a function of the external driving amplitude. As the mechanism behind this effect, we identify the corresponding oscillations of difference in the number of locked and running trajectories that carry the leading contribution to the diffusion coefficient. Our findings can be verified experimentally in a multitude of physical systems, including colloidal particles, Josephson junction, or cold atoms dwelling in optical lattices, to name only a few.]]></summary>

We evaluate Schelling’s segregation outcomes from the square lattice, regular random networks, and clustered regular random networks by situating them in the probability distribution of the entire outcome space of satisfaction and segregation. To do so, we employ the Wang–Landau algorithm and calculate the entropy and the number of states as a function of satisfaction and segregation. According to the results, satisfaction tends to increase with segregation, irrespective of the network structure. Moreover, segregation occurs almost surely when satisfaction is maximized, which we also algebraically derive and confirm on infinite-size networks. The average ratios of the neighbors of the same tag are about 67% for the square lattice and regular random networks and about 73% for clustered regular random networks with a clustering coefficient of 0.37(1). Thus, clustering increases segregation on regular random networks. Further, we find that Schelling’s path-dependent process generates sharper segregation than expected by random configurations, an outcome symptomatic of over-optimization from the social welfare perspective. Adopting an alternative rule restricting individuals’ choice set may reduce segregation without compromising on satisfaction.]]></summary>

Convective dissolution can occur in porous media when a given solute dissolves in a host layer from above and increases the density of the host solution. Buoyancy-driven fingering can then develop, which increases the transfer flux of the solute. We investigate here numerically the properties of this convective dissolution when the porous host layer is inclined by an angle [math] relative to the horizontal direction. We consider an incompressible flow in porous media governed by Darcy’s law, driven by density gradients associated with the concentration of the dissolving solute. The model problem focuses on the case of a very long (infinite) tilted porous layer limited by two parallel impermeable surfaces. A linear stability analysis and nonlinear simulations are performed using the Boussinesq approximation. A vorticity-stream function formulation is adopted to solve the two-dimensional hydrodynamic field through the finite element method. We find that the inclination of the interface decreases the growth rate of the instability and the range of unstable wavenumbers, delaying or even suppressing the onset of the fingering instability. Moreover, it introduces a drift velocity on the perturbations, which is characterized here in both the linear stability analysis and the nonlinear simulations.]]></summary>

The complex, highly nonlinear dynamic behavior of nuclear reactors can be captured qualitatively by novel four-dimensional (that is, fourth order) and three-dimensional (that is, third order) models of chaotic systems and analyzed with Lyapunov spectra, bifurcation diagrams, and phase diagrams. The chaotic systems exhibit a rich variety of bifurcation phenomena, including the periodic-doubling route to chaos, reverse bifurcations, anti-monotonicity, and merging chaos. The offset boosting method, which relocates the attractor’s basin of attraction in any direction, is demonstrated in these chaotic systems. Both constant parameters and periodic functions are seen in offset boosting phenomena, yielding chaotic attractors with controlled mean values and coexisting attractors.]]></summary>

Our increasing dependence on infrastructure networks leads to growing concerns over the protection of these networks. Many methods have been proposed to select protective strategies by combining complex network theory and game theory. However, the misleading effect of hidden links is not considered in previous methods. This work creates an information gap between attackers and defenders by partly hiding network links to mislead the attacker in the game. We first introduce the rule of link hiding that depends on the nodes’ property, where the number of hidden links has a maximum value. Additionally, based on the Stackelberg game model, we establish an attack–defense game model with link hiding strategies considering node property and cost constraints. Finally, we conduct experiments in a scale-free network and an existing power grid. The experimental results show that the defender tends to combine first-mover advantage and link hiding to get a better payoff under more different costs of the nodes. Hiding half of the links in the existing power grid can effectively reduce network damage by about [math]% on average, with the two sides investing the same resources. The effect of link hiding could be more obvious when the attacker owns more resources than the defender. When an attacker employs the high-degree attacking strategy, the proposed link hiding method can help the defender reduce the damage to the network by 12.2% compared to the link reconnecting method.]]></summary>

One approach to understand the chaotic dynamics of nonlinear dissipative systems is the study of non-chaotic yet dynamically unstable invariant solutions embedded in the system’s chaotic attractor. The significance of zero-dimensional unstable fixed points and one-dimensional unstable periodic orbits capturing time-periodic dynamics is widely accepted for high-dimensional chaotic systems, including fluid turbulence, while higher-dimensional invariant tori representing quasiperiodic dynamics have rarely been considered. We demonstrate that unstable 2-tori are generically embedded in the hyperchaotic attractor of a dissipative system of ordinary differential equations; tori can be numerically identified via bifurcations of unstable periodic orbits and their parameteric continuation and characterization of stability properties are feasible. As higher-dimensional tori are expected to be structurally unstable, 2-tori together with periodic orbits and equilibria form a complete set of relevant invariant solutions on which to base a dynamical description of chaos.]]></summary>

Reservoir computing is a machine learning approach that can generate a surrogate model of a dynamical system. It can learn the underlying dynamical system using fewer trainable parameters and, hence, smaller training data sets than competing approaches. Recently, a simpler formulation, known as next-generation reservoir computing, removed many algorithm metaparameters and identified a well-performing traditional reservoir computer, thus simplifying training even further. Here, we study a particularly challenging problem of learning a dynamical system that has both disparate time scales and multiple co-existing dynamical states (attractors). We compare the next-generation and traditional reservoir computer using metrics quantifying the geometry of the ground-truth and forecasted attractors. For the studied four-dimensional system, the next-generation reservoir computing approach uses [math] less training data, requires [math] shorter “warmup” time, has fewer metaparameters, and has an [math] higher accuracy in predicting the co-existing attractor characteristics in comparison to a traditional reservoir computer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it predicts the basin of attraction with high accuracy. This work lends further support to the superior learning ability of this new machine learning algorithm for dynamical systems.]]></summary>

The low-frequency variability of the extratropical atmosphere involves hemispheric-scale recurring, often persistent, states known as teleconnection patterns or regimes, which can have a profound impact on predictability on intra-seasonal and longer timescales. However, reliable data-driven identification and dynamical representation of such states are still challenging problems in modeling the dynamics of the atmosphere. We present a new method, which allows us both to detect recurring regimes of atmospheric variability and to obtain dynamical variables serving as an embedding for these regimes. The method combines two approaches from nonlinear data analysis: partitioning a network of recurrent states with studying its properties by the recurrence quantification analysis and the kernel principal component analysis. We apply the method to study teleconnection patterns in a quasi-geostrophical model of atmospheric circulation over the extratropical hemisphere as well as to reanalysis data of geopotential height anomalies in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere atmosphere in the winter seasons from 1981 to the present. It is shown that the detected regimes as well as the obtained set of dynamical variables explain large-scale weather patterns, which are associated, in particular, with severe winters over Eurasia and North America. The method presented opens prospects for improving empirical modeling and long-term forecasting of large-scale atmospheric circulation regimes.]]></summary>

We study the fractional maps of complex order, [math], for [math] and [math] in one and two dimensions. In two dimensions, we study Hénon, Duffing, and Lozi maps, and in [math], we study logistic, tent, Gauss, circle, and Bernoulli maps. The generalization in [math] can be done in two different ways, which are not equivalent for fractional order and lead to different bifurcation diagrams. We observed that the smooth maps, such as logistic, Gauss, Duffing, and Hénon maps, do not show chaos, while discontinuous maps, such as Bernoulli and circle maps,show chaos. The tent and Lozi map are continuous but not differentiable, and they show chaos as well. In [math], we find that the complex fractional-order maps that show chaos also show multistability. Thus, it can be inferred that the smooth maps of complex fractional order tend to show more regular behavior than the discontinuous or non-differentiable maps.]]></summary>

This paper reports the first finding of cupolets in a chaotic Hindmarsh–Rose neural model. Cupolets (chaotic, unstable, periodic, orbit-lets) are unstable periodic orbits that have been stabilized through a particular control scheme by applying a binary control sequence. We demonstrate different neural dynamics (periodic or chaotic) of the Hindmarsh–Rose model through a bifurcation diagram where the external input current, [math], is the bifurcation parameter. We select a region in the chaotic parameter space and provide the results of numerical simulations. In this chosen parameter space, a control scheme is applied when the trajectory intersects with either of the two control planes. The type of the control is determined by a bit in a binary control sequence. The control is either a small microcontrol (0) or a large macrocontrol (1) that adjusts the future dynamics of the trajectory by a perturbation determined by the coding function [math]. We report the discovery of many cupolets with corresponding control sequences and comment on the differences with previously reported cupolets in the double scroll system. We provide some examples of the generated cupolets and conclude by discussing potential implications for biological neurons.]]></summary>

Through implementation of a semi-synthetic regulon, we find that harmonizing cellular and engineering objectives is key to obtaining highest growth rates and yields with minimal metabolic engineering effort showing that "extrinsic" factors - specifically, upstream genes that direct flux of pentoses into central carbon metabolism - are rate-limiting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence has the potential to open insight into the structure of proteins at the scale of evolution. It has only recently been possible to extend protein structure prediction to two hundred million cataloged proteins. Characterizing the structures of the exponentially growing billions of protein sequences revealed by large scale gene sequencing experiments would necessitate a breakthrough in the speed of folding. Here we show that direct inference of structure from primary sequence using a large language model enables an order of magnitude speed-up in high resolution structure prediction. Leveraging the insight that language models learn evolutionary patterns across millions of sequences, we train models up to 15B parameters, the largest language model of proteins to date. As the language models are scaled they learn information that enables prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of individual atoms. This results in prediction that is up to 60x faster than state-of-the-art while maintaining resolution and accuracy. Building on this, we present the ESM Metagenomic Atlas. This is the first large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins, with more than 617 million structures. The atlas reveals more than 225 million high confidence predictions, including millions whose structures are novel in comparison with experimentally determined structures, giving an unprecedented view into the vast breadth and diversity of the structures of some of the least understood proteins on earth.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As synthetic biology expands and accelerates into real-world applications, methods for quantitatively and precisely engineering biological function become increasingly relevant. This is particularly true for applications that require programmed sensing to dynamically regulate gene expression in response to stimuli. However, few methods have been described that can engineer biological sensing with any level of quantitative precision. Here, we present two complementary methods for precision engineering of genetic sensors: in silico selection and machine-learning-enabled forward engineering. Both methods use a large-scale genotype-phenotype dataset to identify DNA sequences that encode sensors with quantitatively specified dose response. First, we show that in silico selection can be used to engineer sensors with a wide range of dose-response curves. To demonstrate in silico selection for precise, multi-objective engineering, we simultaneously tune a genetic sensor's sensitivity (EC50) and saturating output to meet quantitative specifications. In addition, we engineer sensors with inverted dose-response and specified EC50. Second, we demonstrate a machine-learning-enabled approach to predictively engineer genetic sensors with mutation combinations that are not present in the large-scale dataset. We show that the interpretable machine learning results can be combined with a biophysical model to engineer sensors with improved inverted dose-response curves.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cells use signal transduction across their membranes to sense and respond to a wide array of chemical and physical signals. Creating synthetic systems which can harness cellular signaling modalities promises to provide a powerful platform for biosensing and therapeutic applications. As a first step towards this goal, we investigated how bacterial two-component systems can be leveraged to enable transmembrane-signaling with synthetic membranes. Specifically, we demonstrate that a bacterial two-component nitrate-sensing system (NarX-NarL) can be reproduced outside of a cell using synthetic membranes and cell-free protein expression systems. We find that performance and sensitivity of the two-component system can be tuned by altering the biophysical properties of the membrane in which the histidine kinase (NarX) is integrated. Through protein engineering efforts, we modify the sensing domain of NarX to generate sensors capable of detecting an array of ligands. Finally, we demonstrate that these systems can sense ligands in relevant sample environments. By leveraging membrane and protein design, this work helps reveal how transmembrane sensing can be recapitulated outside of the cell, adding to the arsenal of deployable cell-free systems primed for real world biosensing.

Significance StatementCells detect and respond to environmental and chemical information by using a combination of membrane proteins and genetic polymers. Recapitulation of this behavior in synthetic systems holds promise for engineering biosensors and therapeutics. Using the nitrate-sensing bacterial two-component system as a model, we demonstrate methods to reproduce and tune transmembrane signaling in synthetic lipid membranes, leading to the synthesis of genetically programmed proteins. Through this study, we gain insight into how membrane augmented cell-free systems can be used as a platform to characterize membrane-receptor interactions and engineer new biosensors.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many applications of synthetic biology involve engineering microbial strains to express high-value proteins. Thanks to advances in rapid DNA synthesis and sequencing, deep learning has emerged as a promising approach to build sequence-to-expression models for strain design and optimization. Such models, however, require large amounts of training data that are costly to acquire, which creates substantial entry barriers for many laboratories. Here, we study the relation between model accuracy and data efficiency in a large panel of machine learning models of varied complexity, from penalized linear regressors to deep neural networks. Our analysis is based on data from a large genotype-phenotype screen in \textit{Escherichia coli}, which was generated with a design-of-experiments approach to balance coverage and depth of the genotypic space. We sampled these data to emulate scenarios with a limited number of DNA sequences for training, as commonly encountered in strain engineering applications. Our results suggest that classic, non-deep, models can achieve good prediction accuracy with much smaller datasets than previously thought, and provide robust evidence that convolutional neural networks further improve performance with the same amount of data. Using methods from Explainable AI and model benchmarking, we show that convolutional neural networks have an improved ability to discriminate between input sequences and extract sequence features that are highly predictive of protein expression. We moreover show that controlled sequence diversity leads to important gains in data efficiency, and validated this principle in a separate genotype-phenotype screen in \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}. These results provide practitioners with guidelines for designing experimental screens that strike a balance between cost and quality of training data, laying the groundwork for wider adoption of deep learning across the biotechnology sector.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BackgroundOver the 70 years since the introduction of plastic into everyday items, plastic waste has become an increasing problem. With over 360 million tonnes of plastics produced every year, solutions for plastic recycling and plastic waste reduction are sorely needed. Recently, multiple enzymes capable of degrading PET (polyethylene teraphthalate) plastic have been identified and engineered. In particular, the enzymes PETase and MHETase from Ideonella sakaiensis depolymerize PET into the two building blocks used for its synthesis, ethylene glycol (EG) and terephthalic acid (TPA). Importantly, EG and TPA can be re-used for PET synthesis allowing complete and sustainable PET recycling.

ResultsIn this study, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a platform to develop a whole-cell catalyst expressing the MHETase enzyme, which converts MHET (monohydroxyethyl terephthalate) into TPA and EG. We assessed six expression architectures and identified those resulting in efficient MHETase expression on the yeast cell surface. We show that the MHETase whole-cell catalyst has activity comparable to recombinant MHETase purified from Escherichia coli. Finally, we demonstrate that surface displayed MHETase is stable to pH, temperature, and for at least 12 days at room temperature.

ConclusionsWe demonstrate the feasibility of using S. cerevisiae as a platform for the expression and surface display of PET degrading enzymes and predict that the whole-cell catalyst will viable alternatives to protein purification-based approaches for plastic degradation.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Data-driven stochastic parameterization methods use observational data to support and improve existing prediction systems. Specifically in atmospheric sciences, uncertainty in observations is a challenge for modeling because several aspects of the physical processes are yet to be understood in some contexts. A key goal in constructing atmospheric models is to express unresolved processes using the resolved variables of a prediction system. Estimating parameterisations for highly nonlinear systems with non stationary data requires application-specific tools. Previous work on methods for analyzing nonstationary data presents a flexible model-based nonparametric clustering methodology that can be exploited for parameterization development. This paper adapts the existing framework for stochastic parameterization by combining the continuous-time formulation of stochastic differential equations (SDE) with the clustering method. We use a closed-form likelihood function approach based on a suitable Hermite expansion to approximate the parameter values of the SDE with arbitrary nonlinear drift and nonlinear diffusion. The novel parameterization framework provides a smooth classification function that allows us to recover the underlying temporal parameter modulation of a nonstationary one-dimensional SDE. The numerical examples show that the clustering approach recovers a hidden functional relationship between the parameters of the SDE model and an additional auxiliary process. The study builds upon this functional relationship to develop closed-form, nonstationary, data-driven stochastic models for multiscale dynamical systems in real-world applications.]]></summary>

This paper applies new and recently introduced approaches to study trends in gun violence in the United States. We use techniques in both the time and frequency domain to provide a more complete understanding of gun violence dynamics. We analyze gun violence incidents on a state-by-state basis as recorded by the Gun Violence Archive. We have numerous specific phenomena of focus, including periodicity of incidents, locations in time where behavioral changes occur, and shifts in gun violence patterns since April 2020. First, we implement a recently introduced method of spectral density estimation for nonstationary time series to investigate periodicity on a state-by-state basis, including revealing where periodic behaviors change with time. We can also classify different patterns of behavioral changes among the states. We then aim to understand the most significant shifts in gun violence since numerous key events in 2020, including the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns, and periods of civil unrest. Our dual-domain analysis provides a more thorough understanding and challenges numerous widely held conceptions regarding the prevalence of gun violence incidents.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the primary etiologic agent of traveler's diarrhea and a major cause of diarrheal disease and death worldwide, especially in infants and young children. Despite significant efforts over the past several decades, an affordable vaccine that significantly reduces mortality and morbidity associated with moderate to severe diarrhea among children under the age of 5 years remains an unmet aspirational goal. Here, we describe robust, cost-effective biosynthetic routes that leverage glycoengineered strains of non-pathogenic Escherichia coli or their cell-free extracts for producing conjugate vaccine candidates against two of the most prevalent O serogroups of ETEC, O148 and O78. Specifically, we demonstrate site-specific installation of O-antigen polysaccharides (O-PS) corresponding to these serogroups onto licensed carrier proteins using the oligosaccharyltransferase PglB from Campylobacter jejuni. The resulting conjugates stimulate strong O-PS-specific humoral responses in mice and elicit IgG antibodies that possess bactericidal activity against the cognate pathogens. We also show that one of the prototype conjugates decorated with serogroup O148 O-PS confers protection against ETEC infection in mice. We anticipate that our bacterial cell-based and cell-free platforms will enable creation of multivalent formulations with the potential for broad ETEC serogroup protection and increased access through low-cost biomanufacturing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Advancements in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies have enabled a novel paradigm of protein design where machine learning (ML) models trained on experimental data are used to guide exploration of a protein fitness landscape. ML-guided directed evolution (MLDE) builds on the success of traditional directed evolution and unlocks strategies which make more efficient use of experimental data. Building an MLDE pipeline involves many design choices across the design-build-test-learn loop ranging from data collection strategies to modeling, each of which has a large impact on the success of designed sequences. The cost of collecting experimental data makes benchmarking every component of these pipelines on real data prohibitively difficult, necessitating the development of synthetic landscapes where MLDE strategies can be tested. In this work, we develop a framework called SLIP ("Synthetic Landscape Inference for Proteins") for constructing biologically-motivated synthetic landscapes with tunable difficulty based on Potts models. This framework can be extended to any protein family for which there is a sequence alignment. We show that without tuning, Potts models are easy to optimize. In contrast, our tuning framework provides landscapes sufficiently challenging to benchmark MLDE pipelines.

We provide a convergence analysis of the localized orthogonal decomposition (LOD) method for Schrödinger equations with general multiscale potentials in the semiclassical regime. We focus on the influence of the semiclassical parameter and the multiscale structure of the potential on the numerical scheme. We construct localized multiscale basis functions by solving a constrained energy minimization problem in the framework of the LOD method. We show that localized multiscale basis functions with a smaller support can be constructed as the semiclassical parameter approaches zero. We obtain the first-order convergence in the energy norm and second-order convergence in the

                     norm for the LOD method and super convergence rates can be obtained if the solution possesses sufficiently high regularity. We analyse the temporal and spatial regularity of the solution and find that the spatial derivatives are more oscillatory than the time derivatives in the presence of a multiscale potential. By combining the regularity analysis, we are able to derive the dependence of the error estimates on the small parameters of the Schrödinger equation. Moreover, we find that the LOD method outperforms the finite element method in the presence of a multiscale potential due to the super convergence for high-regularity solutions and more relaxed dependence of the error estimates on the small parameters for low-regularity solutions. Finally, we present numerical results to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

For numerically solving the high frequency Helmholtz equation, the conventional finite difference and finite element methods based on discretizing the equation on meshes usually suffer from the numerical dispersion errors (‘pollution effect’) that require very refined meshes (Babuska and Sauter in SIAM Rev 42(3):451–484, 2000). Asymptotic methods like geometrical optics provide an alternative way to compute the solutions without ‘pollution effect’, but they generally can only compute locally valid approximations for the solutions and fail to capture the caustics faithfully. In order to obtain globally valid solutions efficiently without ‘pollution effect’, we transfer the problem into a fixed-point problem related to an exponential operator, and the associated functional evaluations are achieved by unconditionally stable operator-splitting based pseudospectral schemes such that large step sizes are allowed to reach the approximated fixed point efficiently for certain prescribed accuracy requirement. And the Anderson acceleration is incorporated to accelerate the convergence. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the method.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We use a general epidemic model, the SEIRS model with a general nonlinear incidence rate, to show how the recently established generic Poincaré–Bendixson theory of flows monotone with respect to a cone of rank 2 can be used to establish the generic convergence to periodic orbits. Our approach to establishing generic convergence to periodic solutions applies to high-dimensional epidemic systems and predator-prey systems, very much like the generic convergence to equilibria in cooperative systems using the classical monotone dynamical systems theory.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Optimal transport, a theory for optimal allocation of resources, is widely used in various fields such as astrophysics, machine learning, and imaging science. However, many applications impose elementwise constraints on the transport plan which traditional optimal transport cannot enforce. Here we introduce supervised optimal transport (sOT), which formulates a constrained optimal transport problem where couplings between certain elements are prohibited according to specific applications. sOT is proved to be equivalent to an [math] penalized optimization problem, from which efficient algorithms are designed to solve its entropy regularized formulation. We demonstrate the capability of sOT by comparing it to other variants and extensions of traditional optimal transport in the color transfer problem. We also study the barycenter problem in sOT formulation, where we discover and prove a unique reverse and portion selection (control) mechanism. Supervised optimal transport is broadly applicable to applications in which a constrained transport plan is involved and the original unit should be preserved by avoiding normalization.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In the online packet scheduling problem with deadlines ([math], for short), the goal is to schedule transmissions of packets that arrive over time in a network switch and need to be sent across a link. Each packet has a deadline, representing its urgency, and a nonnegative weight, which represents its priority. Only one packet can be transmitted in any time slot, so if the system is overloaded, some packets will inevitably miss their deadlines and be dropped. In this scenario, the natural objective is to compute a transmission schedule that maximizes the total weight of packets that are successfully transmitted. The problem is inherently online, with the scheduling decisions made without the knowledge of future packet arrivals. The central problem concerning [math] that has been a subject of intensive study since 2001 is to determine the optimal competitive ratio of online algorithms, namely the worst-case ratio between the optimum total weight of a schedule (computed by an offline algorithm) and the weight of a schedule computed by a (deterministic) online algorithm. We solve this open problem by presenting a [math]-competitive online algorithm for [math] (where [math] is the golden ratio), matching the previously established lower bound.]]></summary>

Almost all epidemic models make the assumption that infection is driven by the interaction between pairs of individuals, one of whom is infectious and the other of whom is susceptible. However, in society individuals mix in groups of varying sizes, at varying times, allowing one or more infectives to be in close contact with one or more susceptible individuals at a given point in time. In this paper we study the effect of mixing groups beyond pairs on the transmission of an infectious disease in an SIR (susceptible

We also derive central limit theorems for the final size of (i) an epidemic with many initial infectives and (ii) a major outbreak triggered by few initial infectives. We show that, for a given basic reproduction number

In this paper, a fifth-order finite difference mapped weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme with unequal-size stencils, termed as MUS-WENO, is designed for hyperbolic conservation laws. The new mapping function and nonlinear weights are proposed to reduce the difference between the linear weights and nonlinear weights. It could get smaller numerical errors and obtain fifth-order accuracy, give optimal fifth-order convergence with a tiny

                     even near critical points in smooth regions, and simultaneously suppress spurious oscillations near strong discontinuities. Comparing with the classical fifth-order finite difference WENO schemes and fifth-order finite difference mapped WENO (MWENO) schemes, this mapped WENO scheme uses three unequal-size stencils and the linear weights which can be any positive numbers on condition that their summation is one. Another advantage is that we can reconstruct polynomial over the whole big stencil, while many classical high-order WENO reconstructions only reconstruct the values at the boundary points or discrete quadrature points. Extensive examples including some steady-state problems and some low density, low pressure, or low energy extreme problems are used to testify the good representations of this new MUS-WENO scheme.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We show the possibility of achieving nonreciprocal wave propagation in space-time modulated media and give an asymptotic analysis of the nonreciprocity property in terms of the amplitude of the time modulation. Such modulation causes a folding of the band structure of the material, which may induce degenerate points. By breaking time-reversal symmetry, we show that these degeneracies may open into nonsymmetric, unidirectional band gaps. Finally, we illustrate our results by several numerical simulations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Under the strong exponential-time hypothesis, the diameter of general unweighted graphs cannot be computed in truly subquadratic time (in the size [math] of the input), as shown by Roditty and Williams. Nevertheless there are several graph classes for which this can be done such as bounded-treewidth graphs, interval graphs, and planar graphs, to name a few. We propose to study unweighted graphs of constant distance Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC)-dimension as a broad generalization of many such classes—where the distance VC-dimension of a graph [math] is defined as the VC-dimension of its ball hypergraph whose hyperedges are the balls of all possible radii and centers in [math].

 Abstract. This paper proposes a new general technique for maximal subgraph enumeration which we call proximity search, whose aim is to design efficient enumeration algorithms for problems that could not be solved by existing frameworks. To support this claim and illustrate the technique we include output-polynomial algorithms for several problems for which output-polynomial algorithms were not known, including the enumeration of maximal bipartite subgraphs, maximal [math]-degenerate subgraphs (for bounded [math]), maximal induced chordal subgraphs, and maximal induced trees. Using known techniques, such as reverse search, the space of all maximal solutions induces an implicit directed graph called “solution graph” or “supergraph,” and solutions are enumerated by traversing it; however, nodes in this graph can have exponential out-degree, thus requiring exponential time to be spent on each solution. The novelty of proximity search is a formalization that allows us to define a better solution graph, and a technique, which we call canonical reconstruction, by which we can exploit the properties of given problems to build such graphs. This results in solution graphs whose nodes have significantly smaller (i.e., polynomial) out-degree with respect to existing approaches, but that remain strongly connected, so that all solutions can be enumerated in polynomial delay by a traversal. A drawback of this approach is the space required to keep track of visited solutions, which can be exponential; we further propose a technique to induce a parent-child relationship among solutions and achieve polynomial space when suitable conditions are met.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the following problem: Given a continuous domain [math] along with its convex hull [math], a point [math], and a measure [math] on [math], find the probability density over [math] whose marginal is [math] and that minimizes the KL divergence to the uniform density with respect to [math]. Several distributions in mathematics, physics, statistics, and theoretical computer science arise by different settings of the parameters of this problem. We give a polynomial bound on the norm of the optimizer of the dual problem that holds in a very general setting and relies on a “balance” property of the measure [math] on [math], and exact algorithms for evaluating the dual and its gradient for several interesting settings of [math] and [math]. Together, along with the ellipsoid method, these results imply polynomial-time algorithms to compute such KL divergence minimizing distributions in several cases. Applications of our results include (1) an optimization characterization of the Goemans–Williamson measure [M. X. Goemans and D. P. Williamson, J ACM, 42 (1995), pp. 1115–1145] that is used to round a positive semidefinite matrix to a vector; (2) the computability of the entropic barrier for convex bodies, given a strong integration oracle, studied by [S. Bubeck and R. Eldan, Proc. Mach. Learn. Res. (PMLR), 40 (2015), p. 279], and (3) a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the barycentric quantum entropy of a density matrix that was proposed as an alternative to von Neumann entropy [W. Band and J. L. Park, Found. Phys., 6 (1976), pp. 249–262; J. L. Park and W. Band, Found. Phys., 7 (1977), pp. 233–244; P. B. Slater, Phys. Lett. A, 159 (1991), pp. 411–414]; this corresponds to the case when [math] is the set of rank-one projection matrices and [math] is derived from the Haar measure on the unit sphere.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper considers Bayesian revenue maximization in the [math]-unit setting, where a monopolist seller has [math] copies of an indivisible item and faces [math] unit-demand buyers (whose value distributions can be nonidentical). Four basic mechanisms among others have been widely employed in practice and widely studied in the literature: Myerson auction, sequential posted-pricing, [math]-th price auction with anonymous reserve, and anonymous pricing. Regarding a pair of mechanisms, we investigate the largest possible ratio between the two revenues (also known as the revenue gap), over all possible value distributions of the buyers. Divide these four mechanisms into two groups: (i) the discriminating mechanism group, Myerson auction and sequential posted-pricing, and (ii) the anonymous mechanism group, anonymous reserve and anonymous pricing. Within one group, the involved two mechanisms have an asymptotically tight revenue gap of [math]. In contrast, any two mechanisms from the different groups have an asymptotically tight revenue gap of [math].]]></summary>

In this paper, the dynamics of a single population model with a general growth function is investigated in an advective environment. We show the existence of a nonconstant positive steady state, and give sufficient conditions for the occurrence of a Hopf bifurcation at the positive steady state. Moreover, the theoretical results are applied to the diffusive Nicholson’s blowflies and Mackey–Glass’s models with advection and delay, respectively. We numerically show that the population density decreases as the increase of advection rate or death rate, and a delay-induced Hopf bifurcation is more likely to occur with small advection or low mortality rate.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
By generating transient encounters between individuals beyond their immediate social environment, transport can have a profound impact on the spreading of an epidemic. In this work, we consider epidemic dynamics in the presence of the transport process that gives rise to a multiplex network model. In addition to a static layer, the (multiplex) epidemic network consists of a second dynamic layer in which any two individuals are connected for the time they occupy the same site during a random walk they perform on a separate transport network. We develop a mean-field description of the stochastic network model and study the influence the transport process has on the epidemic threshold. We show that any transport process generally lowers the epidemic threshold because of the additional connections it generates. In contrast, considering also random walks of fractional order that in some sense are a more realistic model of human mobility, we find that these non-local transport dynamics raise the epidemic threshold in comparison to a classical local random walk. We also test our model on a realistic transport network (the Munich U-Bahn network), and carefully compare mean-field solutions with stochastic trajectories in a range of scenarios.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Recently, a golden ratio primal-dual algorithm (GRPDA) was proposed by Chang and Yang for solving structured convex optimization problems. It is a new adaptation of the classical Arrow-Hurwicz method by using a convex combination step, instead of the widely adopted extrapolation technique. The convex combination step is determined by a parameter 
                      
                      \(\psi \)
                      
                    , which, to guarantee global convergence, is restricted to 
                      
                      \((1, (1+\sqrt{5})/2]\)
                      
                    . In this paper, by carrying out a refined analysis, we expand this region to 
                      
                      \((1, 1+\sqrt{3})\)
                      
                    . Moreover, we establish ergodic sublinear convergence rate results based on function value residual and constraint violation of an equivalently reformulated constrained optimization problem, rather than the previously adopted so-called primal-dual gap function that could vanish at nonstationary points. For linear equality constrained and regularized least-squares problems, we further show that GRPDA and Chambolle-Pock’s primal-dual algorithm are equivalent provided that some parameters are chosen properly. Finally, experimental results on the LASSO and the basis pursuit problems are presented to demonstrate the performance of GRPDA with 
                      
                      \(\psi \)
                      
                     being chosen in the expanded region.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We introduce an end-to-end deep learning architecture called the wide-band butterfly network (WideBNet) for approximating the inverse scattering map from wide-band scattering data. This architecture incorporates tools from computational harmonic analysis, such as the butterfly factorization, and traditional multi-scale methods, such as the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm, to drastically reduce the number of trainable parameters to match the inherent complexity of the problem. As a result, WideBNet is efficient: it requires fewer training points than off-the-shelf architectures and has stable training dynamics which are compatible with standard weight initialization strategies. The architecture automatically adapts to the dimensions of the data with only a few hyper-parameters that the user must specify. WideBNet is able to produce images that are competitive with optimization-based approaches, but at a fraction of the cost, and we also demonstrate numerically that it learns to super-resolve scatterers with a full aperture configuration.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we consider the classical wave equation with time-dependent, spatially multiscale coefficients. We propose a fully discrete computational multiscale method in the spirit of the localized orthogonal decomposition in space with a backward Euler scheme in time. We show optimal convergence rates in space and time beyond the assumptions of spatial periodicity or scale separation of the coefficients. Further, we propose an adaptive update strategy for the time-dependent multiscale basis. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results and showcase the practicability of the adaptive update strategy.]]></summary>

                    -error estimates for the AS decomposition of u, truncated after K terms, when u is piecewise constant and consists of K characteristic functions over Lipschitz domains and a background. Our estimates apply both to the continuous and the discrete Galerkin finite element setting. Numerical examples illustrate the accuracy of the AS decomposition for media that either do, or do not, satisfy the assumptions of the theory.]]></summary>

The elastic transmission eigenvalue problem, arising from the inverse scattering theory, plays a critical role in the qualitative reconstruction methods for elastic media. In this paper, we discuss the finite element method for solving the elastic transmission eigenvalue problem with different elastic tensors and different mass densities.

The log-sum penalty is often adopted as a replacement for the 
                      
                      \(\ell _0\)
                      
                     pseudo-norm in compressive sensing and low-rank optimization. The proximity operator of the 
                      
                      \(\ell _0\)
                      
                     penalty, i.e., the hard-thresholding operator, plays an essential role in applications; similarly, we require an efficient method for evaluating the proximity operator of the log-sum penalty. Due to the nonconvexity of this function, its proximity operator is commonly computed through the iteratively reweighted 
                      
                      \(\ell _1\)
                      
                     method, which replaces the log-sum term with its first-order approximation. This paper reports that the proximity operator of the log-sum penalty actually has an explicit expression. With it, we show that the iteratively reweighted 
                      
                      \(\ell _1\)
                      
                     solution disagrees with the true proximity operator in certain regions. As a by-product, the iteratively reweighted 
                      
                      \(\ell _1\)
                      
                     solution is precisely characterized in terms of the chosen initialization. We also give the explicit form of the proximity operator for the composition of the log-sum penalty with the singular value function, as seen in low-rank applications. These results should be useful in the development of efficient and accurate algorithms for optimization problems involving the log-sum penalty. We present applications to solving compressive sensing problems and to mixed additive Gaussian white noise and impulse noise removal.]]></summary>

In this paper, we propose an efficient proper orthogonal decomposition based reduced-order model (POD-ROM) for nonstationary Stokes equations, which combines the classical projection method with POD technique. This new scheme mainly owns two advantages: the first one is low computational costs since the classical projection method decouples the reduced-order velocity variable and reduced-order pressure variable, and POD technique further improves the computational efficiency; the second advantage consists of circumventing the verification of classical LBB/inf-sup condition for mixed reduced spaces with the help of pressure stabilized Petrov–Galerkin (PSPG)-type projection method, where the pressure stabilization term is inherent which allows the use of non inf-sup stable elements without adding extra stabilization terms. We analyze the proposed projection POD-ROM’s stability and convergence, and numerical experiments validate those theoretical results and also the high-efficiency.]]></summary>

Simplified conditions are given for the existence and positivity of wave speed for an integro-difference equation with a strong Allee effect and an unbounded habitat. The results are used to obtain the existence of a critical patch size for an equation with a bounded habitat. It is shown that if the wave speed is positive there exists a critical patch size such that for a habitat size above the critical patch size solutions can persist in space, and if the wave speed is negative solutions always approach zero. An analytical integral formula is developed to determine the critical patch size when the Laplace dispersal kernel is used, and this formula shows existence of multiple equilibrium solutions. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate connections among the wave speed, critical patch size, and Allee threshold.]]></summary>

Atherosclerosis, one of the leading causes of death in USA and worldwide, begins with a lesion in the intima of the arterial wall, allowing LDL to penetrate into the intima where they are oxidized. The immune system considers these oxidized LDL as a dangerous substance and tasks the macrophages to attack them; incapacitated macrophages become foam cells and leads to the formation of a plaque. As the plaque continues to grow, it progressively restricts the blood flow, possibly triggering heart attack or stroke. Because the blood vessels tend to be circular, two-space dimensional cross section model is a good approximation, and the two-space dimensional models are studied in Friedman et al. (J Differ Equ 259(4):1227–1255, 2015) and Zhao and Hu (J Differ Equ 288:250–287, 2021). It is interesting to see whether a true three-space dimensional stationary solution can be developed. We shall establish a three-space dimensional stationary solution for the mathematical model of the initiation and development of atherosclerosis which involves LDL and HDL cholesterols, macrophages and foam cells. The model is a highly nonlinear and coupled system of PDEs with a free boundary, the interface between the plaque and the blood flow. We establish infinite branches of symmetry-breaking stationary solutions which bifurcate from the annular stationary solution in the longitude direction.]]></summary>

Game theory is now routinely applied to quantitatively model the decision making of individuals presented with various voluntary actions that can prevent a given disease. Most models consider only a single preventive strategy and the case where multiple preventative actions are available is severely understudied. In our paper, we consider a very simple SI compartmental model of rabies in the domestic dog population. We study two choices of the dog owners: to vaccinate their dogs or to restrict the movements of unvaccinated dogs. We analyze the relatively rich patterns of Nash equilibria (NE). We show that there is always at least one NE at which the owners utilize only one form of prevention. However, there can be up to three different NEs at the same time: two NEs at which the owners use exclusively only the vaccination or movement restriction, and the third NE when the owners use both forms of prevention simultaneously.

Deriving emergent patterns from models of biological processes is a core concern of mathematical biology. In the context of partial differential equations, these emergent patterns sometimes appear as local minimisers of a corresponding energy functional. Here we give methods for determining the qualitative structure of local minimum energy states of a broad class of multi-species nonlocal advection–diffusion models, recently proposed for modelling the spatial structure of ecosystems. We show that when each pair of species respond to one another in a symmetric fashion (i.e. via mutual avoidance or mutual attraction, with equal strength), the system admits an energy functional that decreases in time and is bounded below. This suggests that the system will eventually reach a local minimum energy steady state, rather than fluctuating in perpetuity. We leverage this energy functional to develop tools, including a novel application of computational algebraic geometry, for making conjectures about the number and qualitative structure of local minimum energy solutions. These conjectures give a guide as to where to look for numerical steady state solutions, which we verify through numerical analysis. Our technique shows that even with two species, multi-stability with up to four classes of local minimum energy states can emerge. The associated dynamics include spatial sorting via aggregation and repulsion both within and between species. The emerging spatial patterns include a mixture of territory-like segregation as well as narrow spike-type solutions. Overall, our study reveals a general picture of rich multi-stability in systems of moving and interacting species.]]></summary>

In this paper, we present a novel tensor completion model which combines the Laplace function and an anisotropic total variation regularization. The Laplace function is utilized to approximate the tensor multi-rank, and the total variation regularization is added to improve the local piecewise smoothness and preserve the edges of the restored tensor data. An efficient alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed to tackle the tensor completion model, and its convergence theorem is also derived. Extensive experimental results on color images, videos, multispectral images and magnetic resonance imaging data show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) has become an important methodology in applied mathematics for reducing the computational cost of weak approximations. For many problems, it is well-known that strong pairwise coupling of numerical solutions in the multilevel hierarchy is needed to obtain efficiency gains. In this work, we show that strong pairwise coupling indeed is also important when MLMC is applied to stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) of reaction-diffusion type, as it can improve the rate of convergence and thus improve tractability. For the MLMC method with strong pairwise coupling that was developed and studied numerically on filtering problems in (Chernov in Num Math 147:71-125, 2021), we prove that the rate of computational efficiency is higher than for existing methods. We also provide numerical comparisons with alternative coupling ideas on linear and nonlinear SPDE to illustrate the importance of this feature.]]></summary>

Of paramount importance in both ecological systems and economic policies are the problems of harvesting of natural resources. A paradigmatic situation where this question is raised is that of fishing strategies. Indeed, overfishing is a well-known problem in the management of live-stocks, as being too greedy may lead to an overall dramatic depletion of the population we are harvesting. A closely related topic is that of Nash equilibria in the context of fishing policies. Namely, two players being in competition for the same pool of resources, is it possible for them to find an equilibrium situation? The goal of this paper is to provide a detailed analysis of these two queries (i.e optimal fishing strategies for single-player models and study of Nash equilibria for multiple players…]]></summary>

This paper presents a multirate in time approach for coupled flow and transport problems combined with goal-oriented error control based on the Dual Weighted Residual (DWR) method. The focus is on the implementation of the multirate concept regarding different time scales for the underlying subproblems. Key ingredients are an arbitrary degree discontinuous Galerkin time discretization, an a posteriori error representation for the transport problem coupled with flow and the concept of space-time slabs based on tensor-product spaces. From the latter, a space-time mesh adaptation with highly economical grids is developed. The performance of the approach is studied carefully by numerical convergence examples as well as an example of physical interest for convection-dominated transport.]]></summary>

In this research, a radial basis functions weighted essentially non-oscillatory (RBF-WENO) scheme in the framework of finite difference is developed for solving non-linear degenerate parabolic (NDP) equations which may contain discontinuous solutions. The traditional WENO schemes for solving NDP equations are based on the polynomial interpolation. In this paper, a non-polynomial WENO finite difference scheme in order to enhance the local accuracy is proposed. For a non-polynomial interpolation basis, the infinitely smooth RBFs such as the multi-quadratic are adopted. By optimizing the free parameter in RBFs, the local error generated by the RBFs interpolation can be easily controlled. The formulation of scheme will be described in detail and numerical tests have been prepared to demonstrate the efficiency of the scheme in one and two-dimension. The numerical results demonstrate that the developed non-polynomial WENO schemes enhance the local accuracy and give sharper solution profile than the original WENO based on the polynomial interpolation for solving NDP equations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the solution landscape and bifurcation diagrams of nematic liquid crystals confined on a rectangle, using a reduced two-dimensional Landau–de Gennes framework in terms of two geometry-dependent variables: half short edge length [math] and aspect ratio [math]. First, we analytically prove that, for any [math] with a small enough [math] or for a large enough [math] with a fixed domain size, there is a unique stable solution that has two line defects on the opposite short edges. Second, we numerically construct solution landscapes by varying [math] and [math], and report a novel X state, which emerges from saddle-node bifurcation and serves as the parent state in such a solution landscape. Various new classes are then found among these solution landscapes, including the X class, the S class, and the L class. By tracking the Morse indices of individual solutions, we present bifurcation diagrams for nematic equilibria, thus illustrating the emergence mechanism of critical points and several effects of geometrical anisotropy on confined defect patterns.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Pattern formation arising from the reaction-diffusion epidemic model is a space-time depiction of the distribution and transmission of infectious diseases. Disease control can be achieved by controlling the associated pattern formations. For an SIR reaction-diffusion epidemic model, we review its Turing pattern formations with different transmission rates under the case of a constant recovery rate. To control pattern formations of the SIR epidemic model, we introduce a regulator as a control function of the recovery rate. For a perfect control strategy, it not only leads to a desired pattern formation, but also has a small support in space-time domains. In order to obtain such a control strategy, we propose a sparse optimal control problem governed by the SIR epidemic model. We study the existence of optimal solutions, derive the first order necessary optimality system, obtain the sparsity structure of the control function, and numerically solve the control problem. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectivity of our method.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In mathematical modeling, it is common to have an equation [math], where the exact form of [math] is not known. This article shows that there are large classes of [math] where almost all [math] share the same properties. The classes we investigate are vector spaces [math] of [math] functions [math] that satisfy the following condition: [math] has “almost constant rank" (ACR) if there is a constant integer [math] such that rank[math] for “almost every" [math] and almost every [math]. If the vector space [math] is finite dimensional, then “almost every" is with respect to the Lebesgue measure on [math], and otherwise, it means almost every in the sense of prevalence, as described herein. Most function spaces commonly used for modeling purposes are ACR. In particular, we show that if all of the functions in [math] are linear or polynomial or real analytic, or if [math] is the set of all functions in a “structured system", then [math] is ACR. For each [math] and [math], the solution set of [math] is SolSet[math]. A solution set of [math] is called robust if it persists despite small changes in [math] and [math]. The following two global results are proved for almost every [math] in an ACR vector space [math]: (1) Either the solution set SolSet[math] is robust for almost every [math], or none of the solution sets are robust. (2) The solution set SolSet[math] is a [math]-manifold of dimension [math]. In particular, [math] is the same for almost every [math].]]></summary>

These growth rates correspond to average per-capita growth rates of one species with respect to an ergodic measure supporting other species. In the ecological literature, coexistence often is equated with the invasion growth rates being positive. Intuitively, positive invasion growth rates ensure that species recover from being rare. To provide a mathematically rigorous framework for this approach, we prove theorems that answer two questions: (i) When do the signs of the invasion growth rates determine coexistence? (ii) When signs are sufficient, which invasion growth rates need to be positive? We focus on deterministic models and equate …]]></summary>

Absolute Concentration Robustness (ACR) was introduced by Shinar and Feinberg (Science 327:1389-1391, 2010) as robustness of equilibrium species concentration in a mass action dynamical system. Their aim was to devise a mathematical condition that will ensure robustness in the function of the biological system being modeled. The robustness of function rests on what we refer to as empirical robustness—the concentration of a species remains unvarying, when measured in the long run, across arbitrary initial conditions. Even simple examples show that the ACR notion introduced in Shinar and Feinberg (Science 327:1389-1391, 2010) (here referred to as static ACR) is neither necessary nor sufficient for empirical robustness. To make a stronger connection with empirical robustness, we define dynamic ACR, a property related to long-term, global dynamics, rather than only to equilibrium behavior. We discuss general dynamical systems with dynamic ACR properties as well as parametrized families of dynamical systems related to reaction networks. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for dynamic ACR in complex balanced reaction networks, a class of networks that is central to the theory of reaction networks.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A matrix basis formulation is introduced to represent the [math] frequency domain dyadic Green’s functions of Maxwell’s equations in 3-dimensional layered media. The formulation can be used to decompose the Maxwell’s Green’s functions into independent TE and TM components, each satisfying a scalar Helmholtz equation. Moreover, the interface transmission conditions for the electromagnetic fields can be reduced to decoupled conditions for the matrix basis coefficients at interfaces. Numerical results for the electric and magnetic dyadic Green’s functions for a 10-layer medium show the capability of the proposed formulation.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we formulate susceptible-infected-susceptible reaction-diffusion epidemic models with cognition and show the impact of movement strategies on disease outbreak and mitigation under a spatially heterogeneous environment. The cognitive diffusion either takes a Fokker–Planck type diffusion obtained by Chapman’s diffusion law (called random diffusion) or follows Fick’s diffusion law (called symmetric diffusion). We derive a variational expression of the basic reproduction number [math] for both models and prove that the disease-free equilibrium is unique and globally asymptotically stable if [math]. Furthermore, if [math], the model following Fick’s diffusion law admits at least one endemic equilibrium and the model following Chapman’s diffusion law has a unique endemic equilibrium. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations, which additionally show the segregation phenomenon between susceptible and infected populations regulated by different movement strategies. Spatial segregation here is natural, not caused by an isolation policy, and thus is the most important indicator for an infectious disease to spread or wane in the absence of intervention. The first example shows that a heterogeneous random diffusion segregates infected and susceptible populations further than an ODE model and thus reduces the infection size. However, symmetric diffusion never does that. The second example shows that a heterogeneous random diffusion detriments segregation but still reduces the infection severity by moving infected individuals to a disease-free region. In a certain situation, a heterogeneous random diffusion may increase the infection severity as shown in the last example.]]></summary>

How to determine the spatial distribution and population dynamics of animals are some of the key questions in ecology. These two have been coupled before, but there is no general method for determining spatial distributions based on instantanous behavior coupled with population dynamics. We propose modeling interacting populations with instantaneous habitat choice through mean-field games. By using the framework of variational inequalities, we are able to determine existence and uniqueness for habitat distributions of interacting populations, in both continuous and discrete habitats. With some additional restrictions, we are also able to show existence and uniqueness of fixed-points of the population dynamics along with spatial distributions. We illustrate our theoretical results by studying a Rosenzweig–MacArthur model where predators and consumers inhabit a continuous habitat. This study is conducted both theoretically and numerically. Analyzing the emergent dynamics is possible as viewing the system from the vantage point of variational inequalities allows for applying efficient numerical methods. The generality of our theoretical approach opens up for studying complex ecosystems, e.g. the impact of enrichment on spatial distributions in marine ecosystems.]]></summary>

External beam radiation therapy is a key part of modern cancer treatments which uses high doses of radiation to destroy tumour cells. Despite its widespread usage and extensive study in theoretical, experimental, and clinical works, many questions still remain about how best to administer it. Many mathematical studies have examined optimal scheduling of radiotherapy, and most come to similar conclusions. Importantly though, these studies generally assume intratumoral homogeneity. But in recent years, it has become clear that tumours are not homogeneous masses of cancerous cells, but wildly heterogeneous masses with various subpopulations which grow and respond to treatment differently.

Vegetation patterns with a variety of structures is amazing phenomena in arid or semi-arid areas, which can identify the evolution law of vegetation and are typical signals of ecosystem functions. Many achievements have been made in this respect, yet the mechanisms of uptake–diffusion feedback on the pattern structures of vegetation is not fully understood. To well reveal the influences of parameters perturbation on the pattern formation of vegetation, we give a comprehensive analysis on a vegetation–water model in the forms of reaction–diffusion equation which is posed by Zelnik et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci 112:12,327–12,331, 2015). We obtain the exact parameters range for stationary patterns and show the dynamical behaviors near the bifurcation point based on nonlinear analysis. It is found that the model has the properties of spot, labyrinth and gap patterns. Moreover, water diffusion rate prohibits the growth of vegetation while shading parameter promotes the increase of vegetation biomass. Our results show that gradual transitions from uniform state to gap pattern can occur for suitable value of parameters which may induce the emergence of desertification.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We investigate the transfer function emanating from the linearization of a car-following model for human drivers when taking into account their reaction time, which is known to be a cause of the stop-and-go traffic phenomenon. This leads to a nonrational transfer function, implying nontrivial stability conditions which are explicitly given. They are in particular satisfied whenever string stability holds. We also show how this reaction time can introduce a partial string stability, where the transfer function modulus remains smaller than 1 up to some critical frequency. We explore conditions in the parameter space discriminating between 3 different regimes (stability, string stability, and partial string stability).]]></summary>

To study disease transmission with vaccination based on the network, we map an SIR model to a site-bond percolation model. In the case where the vaccination probability is zero, this model degenerates into a bond percolation model without the immunization. Using the method of generation functions, we obtain exact theoretical results for the epidemic threshold and the average outbreak size. From these exact solutions, we find that the epidemic threshold increases while the average outbreak size decreases with vaccination probability. Numerical simulations show that the size of giant component S increases with transmissibility T but decreases with the probability of vaccination. In addition, we compare the epidemic threshold and the size of the giant component for a Poisson network, an exponential network and a power-law network using numerical simulations. When the probability of vaccination is fixed, the epidemic threshold is the smallest for heterogeneous networks and the size of giant component S in homogeneous networks becomes largest for large transmissibility T(T close to 1).]]></summary>

Two types of second-order in time partial differential equations, namely semilinear wave equations and semilinear beam equations are considered. To solve these equations with exponential integrators, we present an approach to compute efficiently the action of the matrix exponential as well as those of related matrix functions. Various numerical simulations are presented that illustrate this approach.]]></summary>

To speed-up the solution of parametrized differential problems, reduced order models (ROMs) have been developed over the years, including projection-based ROMs such as the reduced-basis (RB) method, deep learning-based ROMs, as well as surrogate models obtained through machine learning techniques. Thanks to its physics-based structure, ensured by the use of a Galerkin projection of the full order model (FOM) onto a linear low-dimensional subspace, the Galerkin-RB method yields approximations that fulfill the differential problem at hand. However, to make the assembling of the ROM independent of the FOM dimension, intrusive and expensive hyper-reduction techniques, such as the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), are usually required, thus making this strategy less feasible for problems characterized by (high-order polynomial or nonpolynomial) nonlinearities. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a novel strategy for learning nonlinear ROM operators using deep neural networks (DNNs). The resulting hyper-reduced order model enhanced by DNNs, to which we refer to as Deep-HyROMnet, is then a physics-based model, still relying on the RB method approach, however employing a DNN architecture to approximate reduced residual vectors and Jacobian matrices once a Galerkin projection has been performed. Numerical results dealing with fast simulations in nonlinear structural mechanics show that Deep-HyROMnets are orders of magnitude faster than POD-Galerkin-DEIM ROMs, still ensuring the same level of accuracy.]]></summary>

In this paper, we study a posteriori error estimates of the IMEX BDF2 scheme for time discretizations of solving parabolic partial integro-differential equations, which describe the jump-diffusion option pricing model in finance. Because of the initial singularities of the solution which is due to the nonsmoothness of the payoff function, a posteriori error control and adaptivity will be crucial in solving numerically this type of equations. To derive optimal order a posteriori error estimates, quadratic reconstructions for the IMEX BDF2 method are introduced. By using these continuous, piecewise time reconstructions, the upper and lower error bounds depending only on the discretization parameters and the data of the problems are derived. Based on these a posteriori error estimates, we further develop a time adaptive algorithm. The numerical implementations are performed with both nonuniform partitions and adaptivity in time. The adaptive algorithm reduce the computational cost substantially and provides efficient error control for the solution.]]></summary>

The complexity of biological systems, and the increasingly large amount of associated experimental data, necessitates that we develop mathematical models to further our understanding of these systems. Because biological systems are generally not well understood, most mathematical models of these systems are based on experimental data, resulting in a seemingly heterogeneous collection of models that ostensibly represent the same system. To understand the system we therefore need to understand how the different models are related to each other, with a view to obtaining a unified mathematical description. This goal is complicated by the fact that a number of distinct mathematical formalisms may be employed to represent the same system, making direct comparison of the models very diff…]]></summary>

Cancer cells at the tumor boundary move in the direction of the oxygen gradient, while cancer cells far within the tumor are in a necrotic state. This paper introduces a simple mathematical model that accounts for these facts. The model consists of cancer cells, cytotoxic T cells, and oxygen satisfying a system of partial differential equations. Some of the model parameters represent the effect of anti-cancer drugs. The tumor boundary is a free boundary whose dynamics is determined by the movement of cancer cells at the boundary. The model is simulated for radially symmetric and axially symmetric tumors, and it is shown that the tumor may increase or decrease in size, depending on the “strength" of the drugs. Existence theorems are proved, global in-time in the radially symmetric case, and local in-time for any shape of tumor. In the radially symmetric case, it is proved, under different conditions, that the tumor may shrink monotonically, or expand monotonically.]]></summary>

In this paper, we investigate the maximization of the total population of a single species which is governed by a stationary diffusive logistic equation with a fixed amount of resources. For large diffusivity, qualitative properties of the maximizers like symmetry will be addressed. Our results are in line with previous findings which assert that for large diffusion, concentrated resources are favorable for maximizing the total population. Then, an optimality condition for the maximizer is derived based upon rearrangement theory. We develop an efficient numerical algorithm applicable to domains with different geometries in order to compute the maximizer. It is established that the algorithm is convergent. Our numerical simulations give a real insight into the qualitative properties of the maximizer and also lead us to some conjectures about the maximizer.]]></summary>

Discrete dynamical systems in which model components take on categorical values have been successfully applied to biological networks to study their global dynamic behavior. Boolean models in particular have been used extensively. However, multi-state models have also emerged as effective computational tools for the analysis of complex mechanisms underlying biological networks. Models in which variables assume more than two discrete states provide greater resolution, but this scheme introduces discontinuities. In particular, variables can increase or decrease by more than one unit in one time step. This can be corrected, without changing fixed points of the system, by applying an additional rule to each local activation function. On the other hand, if one is interested in cyclic attractors of their system, then this rule can potentially introduce new cyclic attractors that were not observed previously. This article makes some advancements in understanding the state space dynamics of multi-state network models with synchronous, sequential, or block-sequential update schedules and establishes conditions under which no new cyclic attractors are added to networks when the additional rule is applied. Our analytical results have the potential to be incorporated into modeling software and aid researchers in their analyses of biological multi-state networks.]]></summary>
