        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Navigating contemporary healthcare, wearable technology and smartphones are marking the dawn of a transformative era in patient observation and personalised care. Wearables, equipped with various sensing technologies (e.g., accelerometer for movement, optics for heart rate), are increasingly being recognised for their expansive potential in (remote) patient monitoring, diagnostics, and therapeutic applications which suggests a plausible move towards a more decentralised healthcare system. This shift is evident as healthcare providers and patients alike are becoming increasingly accepting of wearable-driven tools, as they enable continuous health monitoring outside of traditional clinical settings. Equally, the ubiquitous nature of smartphones, now more than mere communication tools, is being harnessed to serve as pivotal health monitoring instruments. Their added sensing capabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) driven connectivity enable a (relatively) seamless transition from conventional health practices to a more interconnected, digital age. However, this evolving landscape is not without its challenges, with concerns surrounding data privacy, security, and ensuring equitable access to digital advances. As we delve deeper into digital healthcare, we must harness the full potential of those technologies and ensure their ethical and equitable implementation, envisioning a future where healthcare is not just hospital-centric but is part of our daily lives.]]></summary>

Inverse obstacle scattering is the recovery of an obstacle boundary from the scattering data produced by incident waves. This shape recovery can be done by iteratively solving a PDE-constrained optimization problem for the obstacle boundary. While it is well known that this problem is typically non-convex and ill-posed, previous investigations have shown that in many settings these issues can be alleviated by using a continuation-in-frequency method and introducing a regularization that limits the frequency content of the obstacle boundary. It has been recently observed that these techniques can fail for obstacles with pronounced cavities, even in the case of penetrable obstacles where similar optimization and regularization methods work for the equivalent problem of recovering a piecewise constant wave speed. The present work investigates the recovery of obstacle boundaries for impenetrable, sound-soft media with pronounced cavities, given multi-frequency scattering data. Numerical examples demonstrate that the problem is sensitive to the choice of iterative solver used at each frequency and the initial guess at the lowest frequency. We propose a modified continuation-in-frequency method which follows a random walk in frequency, as opposed to the standard monotonically increasing path. This method shows some increased robustness in recovering cavities, but can also fail for more extreme examples. An interesting phenomenon is observed that while the obstacle reconstructions obtained over several random trials can vary significantly near the cavity, the results are consistent for non-cavity parts of the boundary.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
It has long been known that second order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equations with nonoscillatory coefficients admit nonoscillatory phase functions. This observation is the basis of many techniques for the asymptotic approximation of the solutions of such equations, as well as several schemes for their numerical solution. However, it was only relatively recently exploited to develop the first high-accuracy numerical solver for second order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equations which runs in time independent of frequency. Here, we introduce the first high-accuracy, frequency-independent method for the numerical solution of second order linear inhomogeneous ordinary differential equations. Our algorithm operates by constructing a nonoscillatory phase function representing the solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equation. Then, it uses an adaptive Levin scheme to construct a collection of auxiliary nonoscillatory functions that efficiently represent a highly oscillatory indefinite integral giving a particular solution of the inhomogeneous differential equation. Once the phase function and these auxiliary functions have been constructed, the inhomogeneous equation can be solved subject to essentially any reasonable boundary conditions. The results of numerical experiments illustrating the properties of our scheme are discussed.]]></summary>

We investigate the use of models from the theory of regularity structures as features in machine learning tasks. A model is a polynomial function of a space–time signal designed to well-approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), even in low regularity regimes. Models can be seen as natural multi-dimensional generalisations of signatures of paths; our work therefore aims to extend the recent use of signatures in data science beyond the context of time-ordered data. We provide a flexible definition of a model feature vector associated to a space–time signal, along with two algorithms which illustrate ways in which these features can be combined with linear regression. We apply these algorithms in several numerical experiments designed to learn solutions to PDEs with a given forcing and boundary data. Our experiments include semi-linear parabolic and wave equations with forcing, and Burgers’ equation with no forcing. We find an advantage in favour of our algorithms when compared to several alternative methods. Additionally, in the experiment with Burgers’ equation, we find non-trivial predictive power when noise is added to the observations.]]></summary>

This paper analyses the long-time behaviour of one-stage symplectic or symmetric trigonometric integrators when applied to nonlinear wave equations. It is shown that energy, momentum, and all harmonic actions are approximately preserved over a long time for one-stage explicit symplectic or symmetric trigonometric integrators when applied to nonlinear wave equations via spectral semi-discretisations. For the long-term analysis of symplectic or symmetric trigonometric integrators, we derive a multi-frequency modulated Fourier expansion of the trigonometric integrator and show three almost-invariants of the modulation system. In the analysis of this paper, we neither assume symmetry for symplectic methods, nor assume symplecticity for symmetric methods. The results for symplectic and symmetric methods are obtained as a byproduct of the above analysis. We also give another proof by establishing a relationship between symplectic and symmetric trigonometric integrators and trigonometric integrators which have been researched for wave equations in the literature.]]></summary>

Preconditioning techniques have been focused on multi-linear systems or tensor equations. However, to our knowledge, there is no relevant research on tensor complementarity problems. In this paper, we present a general preconditioner P for solving the tensor complementarity problem (TCP) involved with an 
                      
                      \({\mathcal {L}}\)

                     and a vector q, and we prove that the TCP
                      
                      \(({\mathcal {A}},q)\)
                      
                     is equivalent to the TCP
                      
                      \((P{\mathcal {A}},Pq)\)
                      
                     under the assumption that

                    -tensor. Based on this equivalence, a preconditioned fixed point iteration method is proposed for solving the tensor complementarity problem and its convergence analysis is given. For actual computations, we provide a concrete choice for the preconditioner P associated with a parameter satisfying above-mentioned hypothesis. In addition, it is proved theoretically that the convergence rate of the fixed point method with the chosen preconditioner P is at least as fast as that of the corresponding method without preprocessing. Meanwhile, we also obtain the monotony of the parameter on the performance of the preconditioned iterative method. Lastly, numerical examples are used to demonstrate the theoretical results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Wasserstein–Fisher–Rao (WFR) distance is a family of metrics to gauge the discrepancy of two Radon measures, which takes into account both transportation and weight change. Spherical WFR distance is a projected version of WFR distance for probability measures so that the space of Radon measures equipped with WFR can be viewed as metric cone over the space of probability measures with spherical WFR. Compared to the case for Wasserstein distance, the understanding of geodesics under the spherical WFR is less clear and still an ongoing research focus. In this paper, we develop a deep learning framework to compute the geodesics under the spherical WFR metric, and the learned geodesics can be adopted to generate weighted samples. Our approach is based on a Benamou–Brenier type dynamic formulation for spherical WFR. To overcome the difficulty in enforcing the boundary constraint brought by the weight change, a Kullback–Leibler divergence term based on the inverse map is introduced into the cost function. Moreover, a new regularization term using the particle velocity is introduced as a substitute for the Hamilton–Jacobi equation for the potential in dynamic formula. When used for sample generation, our framework can be beneficial for applications with given weighted samples, especially in the Bayesian inference, compared to sample generation with previous flow models.]]></summary>

For this model, considerable assessment and analysis has been performed, allowing the possibility of a reliable solution method for an eddy viscosity required to compute the Reynolds stresses in the RANS equations.

A novel domain decomposition method is proposed in this paper to solve eigenvalue problems. Both the simple and multiple eigenvalues are considered in algorithm design and theoretical analysis. The key thought is to transform the eigenvalue problem into a number of linear boundary value problems in a multilevel space sequence and some small-scale eigenvalue problems in a low-dimensional correction space. Then some well-developed domain decomposition methods for linear boundary value problem can be directly used to resolve eigenvalue problems. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we can find the presented novel domain decomposition algorithm for eigenvalue problems can derive the same solving efficiency and parallel scalability as that for linear boundary value problems.]]></summary>

In this paper, we are concerned with a class of structured optimization problems frequently arising from image processing and statistical learning, where the objective function is the sum of a quadratic term and a nonsmooth part, and the constraint set consists of a linear equality constraint and two simple convex sets in the sense that projections onto simple sets are easy to compute. To fully exploit the quadratic and separable structure of the problem under consideration, we accordingly propose a partially inertial Douglas–Rachford splitting method. It is noteworthy that our algorithm enjoys easy subproblems for the case where the underlying two simple convex sets are not the whole spaces. Theoretically, we establish the global convergence of the proposed algorithm under some mild conditions. A series of computational results on the constrained Lasso and constrained total-variation (TV) based image restoration demonstrate that our proposed method is competitive with some state-of-the-art first-order solvers.]]></summary>

With the aim to continue developing a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method for problems arisen from photovoltaic cells modeling, in this manuscript we consider the time harmonic Maxwell’s equations in an inhomogeneous bounded bi-periodic domain with quasi-periodic conditions on part of the boundary. We propose an HDG scheme where quasi-periodic boundary conditions are imposed on the numerical trace space. Under regularity assumptions and a proper choice of the stabilization parameter, we prove that the approximations of the electric and magnetic fields converge, in the 
                      
                      \(\textrm{L}^2\)
                      
                    -norm, to the exact solution with order 
                      
                      \(h^{k+1}\)

                    , resp., where h is the meshsize and k the polynomial degree of the discrete spaces. Although, numerical evidence suggests optimal order of convergence for both variables. An a posteriori error estimator for an energy norm is also proposed. We show that it is reliable and locally efficient under certain conditions. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the quasi-periodic HDG method and the adaptive scheme based on the proposed error indicator.]]></summary>

Thresholding-based methods are widely used for sparse optimization problems in many applications including compressive sensing, image processing, and machine learning. However, the hard thresholding method may converge slowly or diverge for many practical problems. In this paper, we propose a scaled proximal gradient method for solving sparse optimization problems, where the scaled matrix can take a varying positive diagonal for connecting the residual reduction. The global convergence of the proposed method is established under some mild assumptions without the restricted isometry property condition. We also present a scaled proximal pursuit and a modified scaled proximal gradient method with global convergence under the restricted isometry property. Finally, some numerical tests are reported to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methods over the classical thresholding-based methods.]]></summary>

In our previous work (Liao et al. in Commun Math Sci, 2022), the complexity of Sinkhorn iteration is reduced from 
                      
                      \(O(N^2)\)
                      
                     to the optimal O(N) by leveraging the special structure of the kernel matrix. In this paper, we explore the special structure of kernel matrices by defining and utilizing the properties of the Lower-ColLinear Triangular Matrix (L-CoLT matrix) and Upper-ColLinear Triangular Matrix (U-CoLT matrix). We prove that (1) L/U-CoLT matrix–vector multiplications can be carried out in O(N) operations; (2) both families of matrices are closed under the Hadamard product and matrix scaling. These properties help to alleviate two key difficulties for reducing the complexity of the Inexact Proximal point method (IPOT), and allow us to significantly reduce the number of iterations to O(N). This yields the Fast Sinkhorn II (FS-2) algorithm for accurate computation of optimal transport with low algorithm complexity and fast convergence. Numerical experiments are presented to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In a reaction network, the concentration of a species with the property of dynamic absolute concentration robustness (dynamic ACR) converges to the same value independent of the overall initial values. This property endows a biochemical network with output robustness and therefore is essential for its functioning in a highly variable environment. It is important to identify the structure of the dynamical system as well as the constraints required for dynamic ACR. We propose a power-engine-load form of dynamic ACR and obtain results regarding convergence to the ACR value based on this form.]]></summary>

 Abstract. For reaction networks arising in systems biology, the capacity for two or more steady states, that is, multistationarity, is an important property that underlies biochemical switches. Another property receiving much attention recently is absolute concentration robustness (ACR), which means that some species concentration is the same at all positive steady states. In this work, we investigate the prevalence of each property while paying close attention to when the properties occur together. Specifically, we consider a stochastic block framework for generating random networks and prove edge-probability thresholds at which, with high probability, multistationarity appears and ACR becomes rare. We also show that the small window in which both properties occur only appears in networks with many species. Taken together, our results confirm that, in random reversible networks, ACR and multistationarity together, or even ACR on its own, is highly atypical. Our proofs rely on two prior results, one pertaining to the prevalence of networks with deficiency zero and the other “lifting” multistationarity from small networks to larger ones.]]></summary>

 Abstract.In this work, we present a novel data-driven method for identifying parametric MIMO generalized state-space or descriptor systems of low order that accurately capture the frequency and time domain behavior of large-scale linear dynamical systems. The low-order parametric descriptor systems are identified from transfer matrix samples by means of two-variable Lagrange rational matrix interpolation. This is done within the Loewner framework by deploying the new matrix-valued barycentric formula given in both right and left polynomial matrix fraction forms, which enables the construction of minimal parametric descriptor systems with rectangular transfer matrices. The developed method allows the reduction of order and parameter dependence complexity of the constructed system. Stability of the system is preserved by the postprocessing technique based on flipping signs of unstable poles. The developed methodology is illustrated with a few academic examples and applied to low-order parametric state-space identification of an aerodynamic system.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Longest common subsequence (LCS) is a classic and central problem in combinatorial optimization. While LCS admits a quadratic time solution, recent evidence suggests that solving the problem may be impossible in truly subquadratic time. A special case of LCS wherein each character appears at most once in every string is equivalent to the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem which can be solved in quasilinear time. In this work, we present novel algorithms for approximating LCS in truly subquadratic time and LIS in truly sublinear time. Our approximation factors depend on the ratio of the optimal solution size to the input size. We denote this ratio by [math] and obtain the following results for LCS and LIS without any prior knowledge of [math]: a truly subquadratic time algorithm for LCS with approximation factor [math] and a truly sublinear time algorithm for LIS with approximation factor [math]. The triangle inequality was recently used by M. Boroujeni, S. Ehsani, M. Ghodsi, M. HajiAghayi, and S. Seddingham [Proceedings of the 29th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 2018, pp. 1170–1189] and D. Chakraborty, D. Das, E. Goldenberg, M. Koucky, and M. Saks [Proceedings of the 59th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2018, pp. 979–990] to present new approximation algorithms for edit distance. Our techniques for LCS extend the notion of the triangle inequality to nonmetric settings.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We present a computational method for studying transverse homoclinic orbits for periodic solutions of delay differential equations, a phenomenon that we refer to as the Poincaré scenario. The strategy is geometric in nature and consists of viewing the connection as the zero of a nonlinear map, such that the invertibility of its Fréchet derivative implies the transversality of the intersection. The map is defined by a projected boundary value problem (BVP), with boundary conditions in the (finite dimensional) unstable and (infinite dimensional) stable manifolds of the periodic orbit. The parameterization method is used to compute the unstable manifold, and the BVP is solved using a discrete time dynamical system approach (defined via the method of steps) and Chebyshev series expansions. We illustrate this technique by computing transverse homoclinic orbits in the cubic Ikeda and Mackey–Glass systems.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Cell polarity and movement are fundamental to many biological functions. Experimental and theoretical studies have indicated that interactions of certain proteins lead to the cell polarization which plays a key role in controlling the cell movement. We study the cell polarity and movement based on a class of biophysical models that consist of reaction-diffusion equations for different proteins and the dynamics of a moving cell boundary. Such a moving boundary is often simulated by a phase-field model. We first apply the matched asymptotic analysis to give a rigorous derivation of the sharp-interface model of the cell boundary from a phase-field model. We then develop a robust numerical approach that combines the level-set method to track the sharp boundary of a moving cell and accurate discretization techniques for solving the reaction-diffusion equations on the moving cell region. Our extensive numerical simulations predict the cell polarization under various kinds of stimuli and capture both the linear and the circular trajectories of a moving cell for a long period of time. In particular, we have identified some key parameters controlling different cell trajectories that are less accurately predicted by reduced models. Our work has linked different models and also developed tools that can be adapted for the challenging three-dimensional simulations.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The (unweighted) tree edit distance problem for [math] node trees asks to compute a measure of dissimilarity between two rooted trees with node labels. The current best algorithm from more than a decade ago runs in [math] time [Demaine et al., Automata, Languages and Programming, Springer, Berlin, 2007, pp. 146–157]. The same paper also showed that [math] is the best possible running time for any algorithm using the so-called decomposition strategy, which underlies almost all the known algorithms for this problem. These algorithms would also work for the weighted tree edit distance problem, which cannot be solved in truly subcubic time under the All-Pairs Shortest Paths conjecture [Bringmann et al., ACM Trans. Algorithms, 16 (2020), pp. 48:1–48:22]. In this paper, we break the cubic barrier by showing an [math] time algorithm for the unweighted tree edit distance problem. We consider an equivalent maximization problem and use a dynamic programming scheme involving matrices with many special properties. By using a decomposition scheme as well as several combinatorial techniques, we reduce tree edit distance to the max-plus product of bounded-difference matrices, which can be solved in truly subcubic time [Bringmann et al., Proceedings of the IEEE 57th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2016, pp. 375–384].]]></summary>

 Abstract. Because of the significance of remediating contaminated ecosystems, many mathematical models have been developed to describe the interactions between populations and toxicants in polluted aquatic environments. These models typically neglect the consequences of toxicant-induced behavioral changes on population dynamics. Taking into account that individuals may flee from areas with high toxicant concentrations to areas with low toxicant concentrations in order to improve their chances of survival, growth, and reproduction, we develop a diffusive population-toxicant model with toxicant-taxis. We establish the global well-posedness of our model and prove the global stability of spatially homogeneous toxicant-only steady states and population-toxicant coexistence steady states under some conditions. We find conditions under which stable spatially inhomogeneous steady states become unstable to trigger spatial pattern formations as the toxicant-taxis is strong. We also identify a narrow parameter regime in which toxicant-only and population-toxicant coexistence steady states are bistable. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate that spatial aggregation and segregation patterns between the population and the toxicant will typically emerge. Our study highlights the important effects of toxicant-induced movement responses on the spatial distributions of populations in polluted aquatic environments.]]></summary>

 Abstract. One of the most important branches of nonlinear control theory of dynamical systems is the so-called sliding mode. Its aim is the design of a (nonlinear) feedback law that brings and maintains the state trajectory of a dynamic system on a given sliding surface. Here, dynamics become completely independent of the model parameters and can be tuned accordingly to the desired target. In this paper we study this problem when the feedback law is subject to strong structural constraints. In particular, we assume that the control input may take values only over two bounded and disjoint sets. Such sets could be also not perfectly known a priori. An example is a control input allowed to switch only between two values. Under these peculiarities, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee sliding-mode control effectiveness for a class of time-varying continuous-time linear systems that includes all the stationary state-space linear models. Our analysis covers several scientific fields. It is only apparently confined to the linear setting and also allows one study an important set of nonlinear models. We describe fundamental examples related to epidemiology where the control input is the level of contact rate among people and the sliding surface permits to control the number of infected. We prove the global convergence of epidemic sliding-mode control schemes applied to two popular dynamical systems used in epidemiology, i.e., SEIR and SAIR, and based on the introduction of severe restrictions like lockdowns. Results obtained in the literature regarding control of many other epidemiological models are also generalized by casting them within a general sliding-mode theory.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The existence of HIV post-treatment controllers (PTCs) offers hope for an HIV functional cure, and understanding the critical mechanisms determining PTC represents a key step toward this goal. Here, we have studied these mechanisms by analyzing an established mathematical model for HIV viral dynamics. In mathematical models, critical mechanisms are represented by parameters that affect the tipping points to induce qualitatively different dynamics, and in cases with multiple stability, the initial conditions of the system also play a role in determining the fate of the solution. As such, for the tipping points in parameter space, we developed and implemented a sensitivity analysis of the threshold conditions of the associated bifurcations to identify the critical mechanisms for this model. Our results suggest that the infected cell death rate and the saturation parameter for cytotoxic T lymphocyte proliferation significantly affect post-treatment control. For the case with multiple stability, in state space of initial conditions, we first investigated the saddle-type equilibrium point to identify its stable manifold, which delimits trapping regions associated to the high and low viral set points. The identified stable manifold serves as a guide for the loads of immune cells and HIV virus at the time of therapy termination to achieve post-treatment control.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Transport coefficients, such as the mobility, thermal conductivity, and shear viscosity, are quantities of prime interest in statistical physics. At the macroscopic level, transport coefficients relate an external forcing of magnitude [math], with [math], acting on the system to an average response expressed through some steady-state flux. In practice, steady-state averages involved in the linear response are computed as time averages over a realization of some stochastic differential equation. Variance reduction techniques are of paramount interest in this context, as the linear response is scaled by a factor of [math], leading to large statistical error. One way to limit the increase in the variance is to allow for larger values of [math] by increasing the range of values of the forcing for which the nonlinear part of the response is sufficiently small. In theory, one can add an extra forcing to the physical perturbation of the system, called synthetic forcing, as long as this extra forcing preserves the invariant measure of the reference system. The aim is to find synthetic perturbations allowing one to reduce the nonlinear part of the response as much as possible. We present a mathematical framework for quantifying the quality of synthetic forcings, in the context of linear response theory, and discuss various possible choices for them. Our findings are illustrated with numerical results in low-dimensional systems.]]></summary>

 Abstract. The transport of particles in cells is influenced by the properties of intracellular networks they traverse while searching for localized target regions or reaction partners. Moreover, given the rapid turnover in many intracellular structures, it is crucial to understand how temporal changes in the network structure affect diffusive transport. In this work, we use network theory to characterize complex intracellular biological environments across scales. We develop an efficient computational method to compute the mean first passage times for simulating a particle diffusing along two-dimensional planar networks extracted from fluorescence microscopy imaging. We first benchmark this methodology in the context of synthetic networks, and subsequently apply it to live-cell data from endoplasmic reticulum tubular networks.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Suppose that you wish to sample a random graph [math] over [math] vertices and [math] edges conditioned on the event that [math] does not contain a “small” [math]-size graph [math] (e.g., clique) as a subgraph. Assuming that most such graphs are [math]-free, the problem can be solved by a simple rejected-sampling algorithm (that tests for [math]-cliques) with an expected running time of [math]. Is it possible to solve the problem in a running time that does not grow polynomially with [math]? In this paper, we introduce the general problem of sampling a “random looking” graph [math] with a given edge density that avoids some arbitrary predefined [math]-size subgraph [math]. As our main result, we show …]]></summary>

 Abstract. We give an algorithm that, given an [math]-vertex graph [math] and an integer [math], in time [math] either outputs a tree decomposition of [math] of width at most [math] or determines that the treewidth of [math] is larger than [math]. This is the first 2-approximation algorithm for treewidth that is faster than the known exact algorithms, and in particular improves upon the previous best approximation ratio of 5 in time [math] given by Bodlaender et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 45 (2016), pp. 317–378]. Our algorithm works by applying incremental improvement operations to a tree decomposition, using an approach inspired by a proof of Bellenbaum and Diestel [Combin. Probab. Comput., 11 (2002), pp. 541–547].]]></summary>

We present a class of arbitrarily high-order conservative schemes for the Klein–Gordon Schrödinger equations. These schemes combine the symplectic Runge–Kutta method with the quadratic auxiliary variable approach. We first introduce an auxiliary variable that satisfies a quadratic equation to reformulate the original system into an equivalent one. This reformulated system possesses two strong quadratic invariants: energy and mass. Next, we discretize the reformulated system using symplectic Runge–Kutta methods, yielding a class of semi-discrete systems with arbitrarily high-order accuracy in time. The semi-discrete systems naturally preserve the discrete contour part of the strong invariants and the relationship of the quadratic equation. By eliminating the intermediate variable, we obtain the original energy conservation law. Then, the Fourier pseudo-spectral method is employed to obtain the fully discrete scheme that preserves the original energy and mass. We provide a fast solver to implement the proposed methods effectively. Numerical experiments demonstrate the expected accuracy and conservation of proposed schemes.]]></summary>

The shear shallow water model is an extension of the classical shallow water model to include the effects of vertical shear. It is a system of six non-linear hyperbolic PDE with non-conservative products. We develop a high-order entropy stable finite difference scheme for this model in one dimension and extend it to two dimensions on rectangular grids. The key idea is to rewrite the system so that non-conservative terms do not contribute to the entropy evolution. Then, we first develop an entropy conservative scheme for the conservative part, which is then extended to the complete system using the fact that the non-conservative terms do not contribute to the entropy production. The entropy dissipative scheme, which leads to an entropy inequality, is then obtained by carefully adding dissipative flux terms. The proposed schemes are then tested on several one and two-dimensional problems to demonstrate their stability and accuracy.]]></summary>

In this paper, we propose a time discontinuous Galerkin scheme for solving the nonlinear time-fractional Schrödinger equation using B-splines in time and Non-Uniform Rational B-splines in space. The technique of comparing real and imaginary parts is utilized to obtain optimal 
                      
                      \(L^2([0,T];L^2(\varOmega ))\)
                      
                     norm error estimate. Specifically, we have achieved 
                      
                      \(r+1\)
                      
                     accuracy in time and 
                      
                      \(p+1\)
                      
                     accuracy in space, where r and p represent the spline degrees in time and space, respectively. The convergence analysis is also provided on time graded mesh, taking into account solutions with initial singularity. Additionally, the space–time isogeometric analysis method is employed to solve the linear time-fractional Schrödinger equation. A new discrete norm is constructed, and the well-posedness analysis and error estimate are performed based on this norm. We can attain 
                      
                      \(\hat{p}\)
                      
                     accuracy concerning the new discrete norm error in space–time domain, where 
                      
                      \(\hat{p}\)
                      
                     denotes space–time spline degree. Theoretical results are validated through using numerical examples.]]></summary>
