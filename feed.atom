In this article, we propose and analyze a fully coupled, nonlinear, and energy-stable virtual element method (VEM) for solving the coupled Poisson–Nernst–Planck (PNP) and Navier–Stokes (NS) equations. These equations model microfluidic and electrochemical systems that include the diffuse transport of charged species within incompressible fluids coupled through electrostatic forces. A mixed VEM is employed to discretize the NS equations whereas classical VEM in primal form is used to discretize the PNP equations. The stability, existence and uniqueness of solution of the associated VEM are proved by fixed point theory. The global mass conservation and electric energy decay of the scheme are also established. Also, we rigorously derive unconditionally optimal error estimates for both the electrostatic potential and ionic concentrations of PNP equations in the

Finally, several numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical analysis of convergence and to illustrate the satisfactory performance of the method in simulating the onset of electrokinetic instabilities in ionic fluids, and studying how they are influenced by different values of ion concentration and applied voltage. These tests are relevant in applications of water desalination.]]></summary>

In this work, two novel classes of structure-preserving spectral Galerkin methods are proposed which based on the Crank–Nicolson scheme and the exponential scalar auxiliary variable method respectively, for solving the coupled fractional nonlinear Klein–Gordon–Schrödinger equation. The paper focuses on the theoretical analyses and computational efficiency of the proposed schemes, the Crank–Nicoloson scheme is proved to be unconditionally convergent and has maximum-norm boundness of numerical solutions. The exponential scalar auxiliary variable scheme is linearly implicit and decoupled, but lack of the maximum-norm boundness, also, the energy structure is modified. Subsequently, the efficient implementations of the proposed schemes are introduced in detail. Both the theoretical analyses and the numerical comparisons show that the proposed spectral Galerkin methods have high efficiency in long-time computations.]]></summary>

In this paper, a block mirror stochastic gradient method is developed to solve stochastic optimization problems involving convex and nonconvex cases, where the feasible set and the variables are treated as multiple blocks. The proposed method combines the features of the classic mirror descent stochastic method and the block coordinate gradient descent method. Acquiring the stochastic gradient information by stochastic oracles, our method updates all the blocks of variables in the Gauss–Seidel type. We establish the convergence for both convex and nonconvex cases. The analysis of our method is challenging because the typical unbiasedness assumption of stochastic gradient fails to hold in the Gauss–Seidel renewal type and requires more specific assumptions. The proposed algorithm is tested on the conditional value-at-risk problem and the stochastic LASSO problem to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
The level-set method is widely used in expanding front simulations in numerous fields of computational research, such as computer graphics, physics, or microelectronics. In the latter, the level-set method is employed for topography simulations of semiconductor device fabrication processes, being driven by complicated physical and chemical models. These models tend to produce surfaces with critical points where accuracy is paramount. To efficiently increase the accuracy in regions neighboring these critical points, automatic hierarchical domain refinement is required, guided by robust feature detection. Feature detection has to be computationally efficient and sufficiently accurate to reliably detect the critical points. To that end, we present a fast parallel geometric feature detection algorithm for three-dimensional level-set functions. Our approach is based on two different, complementary curvature calculation methods of the zero level-set and an optimized feature detection parameter to detect features. For performance reasons, our algorithm can be in principal linked to different curvature calculation methods, however, as will be discussed, two particularly attractive options are available: (i) A novel extension of the standard curvature calculation method for level-set functions, and (ii) an often disregarded method for calculating the curvature due to its purported low numerical accuracy. We show, however, that the latter is still a viable option, and that our algorithm is able to reliably detect features on geometries stemming from complicated, practically relevant geometries. Our algorithm and findings are applicable to other fields of applications such as surface simplification.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Let [math] be a family of sets in some metric space. In the [math]-chasing problem, an online algorithm observes a request sequence of sets in [math] and responds (online) by giving a sequence of points in these sets. The movement cost is the distance between consecutive such points. The competitive ratio is the worst case ratio (over request sequences) between the total movement of the online algorithm and the smallest movement one could have achieved by knowing in advance the request sequence. The family [math] is said to be chaseable if there exists an online algorithm with finite competitive ratio. In 1991, Linial and Friedman conjectured that the family of convex sets in Euclidean space is chaseable. We prove this conjecture.]]></summary>

Concretely, consider an undirected network and a set of packets each with its own source and destination. The objective is to choose a path for each packet, from its source to its destination, so as to minimize [math], defined as follows: The dilation is the maximum path hop length, and the congestion is the maximum number of paths that include any single edge. The routing scheme obliviously and randomly selects a path for each packet independent of (the existence of) the other packets. Despite this obliviousness, the selected paths have [math] within a [math] factor of the best possible value. More precisely, for any integer hop constraint [math], this oblivious routing scheme selects paths of length at most [math] and is [math]-competitive in terms of congestion in comparison to the best possible congestion achievable via paths of length at most [math] hops. These paths can be sampled in polynomial time. This result can be viewed as an analogue of the celebrated oblivious routing results of Räcke [Proceedings of the 43rd Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2002; Proceedings of the 40th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2008], which are [math]-competitive in terms of congestion but are not competitive in terms of dilation.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Submodular function minimization (SFM) and matroid intersection are fundamental discrete optimization problems with applications in many fields. It is well known that both of these can be solved making [math] queries to a relevant oracle (evaluation oracle for SFM and rank oracle for matroid intersection), where [math] denotes the universe size. However, all known polynomial query algorithms are highly adaptive, requiring at least [math] rounds of querying the oracle. A natural question is whether these can be efficiently solved in a highly parallel manner, namely, with [math] queries using only polylogarithmic rounds of adaptivity. An important step towards understanding the adaptivity needed for efficient parallel SFM was taken recently in the work of Balkanski and Singer who showed that any SFM algorithm making [math] queries necessarily requires [math] rounds. This left open the possibility of efficient SFM algorithms in polylogarithmic rounds. For matroid intersection, even the possibility of a constant round, [math] query algorithm was not hitherto ruled out. In this work, we prove that any, possibly randomized, algorithm for submodular function minimization or matroid intersection making [math] queries requires (Throughout the paper, we use the usual convention of using [math] to denote [math] and using [math] to denote [math] for some unspecified constant [math]) [math] rounds of adaptivity. In fact, we show a polynomial lower bound on the number of rounds of adaptivity even for algorithms that make at most [math] queries for any constant [math]. Therefore, even though SFM and matroid intersection are efficiently solvable, they are not highly parallelizable in the oracle model.]]></summary>

The generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) method is one of the most popular method for uncertainty quantification. Being essentially a spectral approach, the gPC method exhibits the spectral convergence rate which heavily depends on the regularity of the solution in the random space. Many regularity studies have been made for stochastic elliptic and parabolic equations while regularities studies of stochastic hyperbolic equations has long been infeasible due to its intrinsic difficulties. In this paper, we investigate the impact of uncertainty on the time-dependent radiative transfer equation (RTE) with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions, which sits somewhere between hyperbolic and parabolic equations. We theoretically prove the a-priori bound of the solution, its continuity with respect to the scattering coefficient, and its regularity in the random space. These studies can serve as a building block in understanding the influence of uncertainties in the passage from hyperbolic to parabolic equations. Moreover, we vigorously justify the validity of the gPC expansion ansatz based on the regularity study. Then the stochastic Galerkin method of the gPC approach is employed to discretize the random variable. We further conduct a delicate analysis to show the exponential decay rate of the gPC coefficients and establish the error estimates of the stochastic Galerkin approximation for both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional random space cases. Numerical tests are presented to verify our analytical results.]]></summary>

Since their introduction the Transformer architectures emerged as the dominating architectures for both natural language processing and, more recently, computer vision applications. An intrinsic limitation of this family of “fully-attentive” architectures arises from the computation of the dot-product attention, which grows both in memory consumption and number of operations as 
                      
                      \(O(n^2)\)
                      
                     where n stands for the input sequence length, thus limiting the applications that require modeling very long sequences. Several approaches have been proposed so far in the literature to mitigate this issue, with varying degrees of success. Our idea takes inspiration from the world of lossy data compression (such as the JPEG algorithm) to derive an approximation of the attention module by leveraging the properties of the Discrete Cosine Transform. An extensive section of experiments shows that our method takes up less memory for the same performance, while also drastically reducing inference time. Moreover, we assume that the results of our research might serve as a starting point for a broader family of deep neural models with reduced memory footprint. The implementation will be made publicly available at https://github.com/cscribano/DCT-Former-Public.]]></summary>

We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of C-FISTA through multiple numerical experiments on group Lasso, group logistic regression and geometric programming models.

 Abstract. One of the most important problems arising in time series analysis is that of classifying the states of a dynamical system. That is, given a collection of time series, is it possible to perform two-state classification (chaotic versus periodic) of the underlying system? For this task, we turn to the field of topological data analysis, which encodes information about the shape and structure of data. In this paper, we investigate a more recent method for encoding the structure of the attractor as a weighted graph, known as the ordinal partition network, representing information about when the dynamical system has passed between certain regions of state space. We provide methods to incorporate the weighting information and show that this framework provides more resilience to noise or perturbations in the system as well as improving the accuracy of dynamic state identification.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We present a mean-field formalism for modeling firing-rate statistics of brain regions whose neurons exhibit atypical firing patterns and heterogeneous electrophysiological properties. We apply the formalism to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)—the human circadian pacemaker—whose neurons can intrinsically exhibit depolarized low-amplitude membrane oscillations (DLAMOs), depolarization block (DB), and standard action potential firing at different times of day. Further, gamma-aminobutyric acid reversal potentials and molecular circadian phases of SCN neurons, among other properties, vary across the network and/or slowly over time. Our formalism consists of a system of integro-differential equations describing the time evolution of the mean and standard deviation of synaptic conductances across the network. Electrophysiological properties of SCN neurons are incorporated by computing responses to synaptic conductance inputs of a Hodgkin–Huxley-type SCN neuron model that exhibits DLAMOs and DB. Such responses are then averaged over distributions of relevant quantities and included in the differential equations. Results suggest mechanisms by which physiologically relevant changes to firing activities may arise, highlighting means by which the amplitude of firing rates may shrink, the standard deviation of firing rates may grow, and by which a mid-day dip in firing rates may appear. For instance, results show that a large spread in circadian phases across SCN neurons reduces the size of oscillations in SCN network firing activity across the 24-hour day, identifying a mechanism by which heterogeneities in neuron electrophysiology could influence circadian rhythms.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, a two-scale approach for elastic shape optimization of fine-scale structures in additive manufacturing is investigated. To this end, a free material optimization is performed on the macro-scale using elasticity tensors in a set of microscopically realizable tensors. A database of these realizable tensors and their cost values is obtained with a shape and topology optimization on microscopic cells, working within a fixed set of elasticity tensors samples. This microscopic optimization takes into account manufacturability constraints via predefined material bridges to neighboring cells at the faces of the microscopic fundamental cell. For the actual additive manufacturing on a chosen fine-scale, a piecewise constant elasticity tensor ansatz on grid cells of a macroscopic mesh is applied. The macroscopic optimization is performed in an efficient online phase, whereas the associated cellwise optimal material patterns are retrieved from the database that was computed offline. For that, the set of admissible realizable elasticity tensors is parametrized using tensor product cubic B-splines over the unit square matching the precomputed samples. This representation is then efficiently used in an interior point method for the free material optimization on the macro-scale.]]></summary>

 Abstract. When waves propagate through a complex medium like the turbulent atmosphere the wave field becomes incoherent and the wave intensity forms a complex speckle pattern. In this paper we study a speckle memory effect in the frequency domain and some of its consequences. This effect means that certain properties of the speckle pattern produced by wave transmission through a randomly scattering medium is preserved when shifting the frequency of the illumination. The speckle memory effect is characterized via a detailed novel analysis of the fourth-order moment of the random paraxial Green’s function at four different frequencies. We arrive at a precise characterization of the frequency memory effect and what governs the strength of the memory. As an application we quantify the statistical stability of time-reversal wave refocusing through a randomly scattering medium in the paraxial or beam regime. Time reversal refers to the situation when a transmitted wave field is recorded on a time-reversal mirror then time reversed and sent back into the complex medium. The re-emitted wave field then refocuses at the original source point. We compute the mean of the refocused wave and identify a novel quantitative description of its variance in terms of the radius of the time-reversal mirror, the size of its elements, the source bandwidth, and the statistics of the random medium fluctuations.]]></summary>

However, under a weaker assumption and with less computational complexity, our algorithms are shown to be able to find a desired cluster with high probability. The “one cluster at a time" feature of our method distinguishes it from other global clustering methods.

The spectral Petrov–Galerkin method is presented by employing truncated spectral expansion of the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) type noise, and error estimates are given based on the obtained regularity of the optimal control problem.

The primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm is popular in solving min-max problems which are being widely used in a variety of areas. To improve the applicability and efficiency of PDHG for different application scenarios, we focus on the preconditioned PDHG (PrePDHG) algorithm, which is a framework covering PDHG, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and other methods. We give the optimal convergence condition of PrePDHG in the sense that the key parameters in the condition can not be further improved, which fills the theoretical gap in the-state-of-art convergence results of PrePDHG, and obtain the ergodic and non-ergodic sublinear convergence rates of PrePDHG. The theoretical analysis is achieved by establishing the equivalence between PrePDHG and indefinite proximal ADMM. Besides, we discuss various choices of the proximal matrices in PrePDHG and derive some interesting results. For example, the convergence condition of diagonal PrePDHG is improved to be tight, the dual stepsize of the balanced augmented Lagrangian method can be enlarged to 4/3 from 1, and a balanced augmented Lagrangian method with symmetric Gauss-Seidel iterations is also explored. Numerical results on the matrix game, projection onto the Birkhoff polytope, earth mover’s distance, and CT reconstruction verify the effectiveness and superiority of PrePDHG.]]></summary>

In this paper we develop a neural network for the numerical simulation of time-dependent linear transport equations with diffusive scaling and uncertainties. The goal of the network is to resolve the computational challenges of curse-of-dimensionality and multiple scales of the problem. We first show that a standard Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) fails to capture the multiscale nature of the problem, hence justifies the need to use Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Networks (APNNs). We show that not all classical AP formulations are directly fit for the neural network approach. We construct a micro-macro decomposition based neural network, and also build in a mass conservation mechanism into the loss function, in order to capture the dynamic and multiscale nature of the solutions. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this APNNs.]]></summary>

We consider the numerical solution of Poisson’s equation on structured grids using geometric multigrid with nonstandard coarse grids and coarse-level operators. We are motivated by the problem of developing high-order accurate numerical solvers for elliptic boundary value problems on complex geometry using overset grids. For flexibility in grid generation, we would like to consider lower-order accurate coarse-level approximations, and coarsening factors other than two. We show that second-order accurate coarse-level approximations are very effective for fourth- or sixth-order accurate fine-level finite-difference discretizations. We study the use of different Galerkin and non-Galerkin coarse-level operators. Using local Fourier analysis (LFA) we choose the smoothing parameter 
                      
                      \(\omega \)
                      
                     and the coarse-level operators to optimize the overall multigrid convergence rate. We show that the results based on LFA for periodic problems also hold for more general boundary conditions provided these are discretized using compatibility conditions. Numerical results for Poisson’s equation on a sample overset grid show that our multigrid solver is many times faster, and uses less memory, than selected Krylov solvers and an algebraic multigrid solver. We also study grid coarsening by a general factor and show that good convergence rates are retained for a range of coarsening factors around two. We ask the question of which coarsening factor leads to the most efficient multigrid algorithm.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We present a data-driven point of view for rare events, which represent conformational transitions in biochemical reactions modeled by overdamped Langevin dynamics on manifolds in high dimensions. We first reinterpret the transition state theory and the transition path theory from the optimal control viewpoint. Given a point cloud probing the manifold, we construct a discrete Markov chain with a [math]-matrix computed from an approximated Voronoi tesselation via the point cloud. We use this [math]-matrix to compute a discrete committor function whose level set automatically orders the point cloud. Then based on the committor function, an optimally controlled random walk on point clouds is constructed and utilized to efficiently sample transition paths, which become an almost sure event in [math] time instead of a rare event in the original reaction dynamics. To compute the mean transition path efficiently, a local averaging algorithm based on the optimally controlled random walk is developed, which adapts the finite temperature string method to the controlled Monte Carlo samples. Numerical examples on sphere/torus including a conformational transition for the alanine dipeptide in vacuum are conducted to illustrate the data-driven solver for the transition path theory on point clouds. The mean transition path obtained via the controlled Monte Carlo simulations highly coincides with the computed dominant transition path in the transition path theory.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the homogenized energy densities of periodic ferromagnetic Ising systems. We prove that, for finite range interactions, the homogenized energy density, identifying the effective limit, is crystalline, i.e., its Wulff crystal is a polytope, for which we can (exponentially) bound the number of vertices. This is achieved by deriving a dual representation of the energy density through a finite cell formula. This formula also permits easy numerical computations: we show a few experiments where we compute periodic patterns which minimize the anisotropy of the surface tension.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
This paper addresses a simple energy-based overset finite element method (EbO-FEM) to solve pseudo-static deformation problems consisting of overlapped meshes based on the domain composition method (DCM). This scheme is a non-iterative equation-based method for enforcing the continuity of the displacement field. Hence, the scheme consumes possible minimal computational costs for deformation problems with non-conforming overlapping meshes. The system’s total energy is augmented with continuity constraint energy (CCE) which is a function of the gaps in the displacement field between two overlapping regions. Subsequently, two conventional integration schemes, the Gauss-point projection, and the point-to-point projection, are utilized to discretize the CCE. It is confirmed that both schemes can yield accurate and unique solutions in the overlapped region of the finite element meshes. Further, we proposed a dimensionless relative penalty parameter (DRP). We found that DRP ranging between 1 to 10 is appropriate to robustly obtain accurate solutions for a wide range of scales, stiffness, and geometries, which is supported by three numerical simulations without increasing computational costs after assembling the global matrices and vectors.]]></summary>
