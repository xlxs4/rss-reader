        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
This paper considers the regularization continuation method and the trust-region updating strategy for the nonlinearly equality-constrained optimization problem. Namely, it uses the inverse of the regularization quasi-Newton matrix as the pre-conditioner and the Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula to improve its computational efficiency in the well-posed phase, and it adopts the inverse of the regularization two-sided projection of the Hessian as the pre-conditioner to improve its robustness in the ill-conditioned phase. Since it only solves a linear system of equations and the Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula significantly saves the computational time at every iteration, and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method needs to solve a quadratic programming subproblem at every iteration, it is faster than SQP. Numerical results also show that it is more robust and faster than SQP (the built-in subroutine fmincon.m of the MATLAB2020a environment and the subroutine SNOPT executed in GAMS v28.2 (GAMS Corporation, 2019) environment). The computational time of the new method is about one third of that of fmincon.m for the large-scale problem. Finally, the global convergence analysis of the new method is also given.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
The Active Flux method is a third order accurate finite volume method for hyperbolic conservation laws, which is based on the use of point values as well as cell average values of the conserved quantities. The resulting method is fully discrete and has a compact stencil in space and time. An important component of Active Flux methods is the evolution formula for the update of the point values. A previously proposed exact evolution formula for acoustics is reviewed and used to construct an Active Flux method for the two-dimensional Maxwell’s equation. Furthermore, the method of bicharacteristics is discussed as a methodology for the derivation of truly multidimensional approximative evolution operators that can be used for the evolution of point values in Active Flux methods. We study accuracy and stability of the resulting methods for acoustics and compare with the Active Flux method that uses the exact evolution operator. Finally, we used the method of bicharacteristics to derive Cartesian grid Active Flux methods for the linearised and nonlinear Euler equations. Numerous test computations illustrate the performance of these new Active Flux methods.]]></summary>

A convergent numerical method for

                    -dissipative solutions of the Hunter–Saxton equation is derived. The method is based on applying a tailor-made projection operator to the initial data, and then solving exactly using the generalized method of characteristics. The projection step is the only step that introduces any approximation error. It is therefore crucial that its design ensures not only a good approximation of the initial data, but also that errors due to the energy dissipation at later times remain small. Furthermore, it is shown that the main quantity of interest, the wave profile, converges in

 Abstract. In this paper, a study is carried out on the spatiotemporal dynamics of a Lengyel–Epstein model describing the chlorite-iodine-malonic-acid (CIMA) reaction with time delay and the Neumann boundary condition in a two-dimensional region. The existences for Turing, Hopf, Turing–Turing, Turing–Hopf, and Bogdanov–Takens bifurcations are derived by analyzing the dispersion relation between eigenvalues and wave numbers. In particular, to study the dynamics around a Turing–Hopf bifurcation singularity, the amplitude equations near a codimension-two bifurcation point are derived by employing the weakly nonlinear analysis method. Different spatiotemporal patterns for the system in parameter space are classified and various patterns identified, including spatially homogeneous periodic solutions, mixed mode, coexistence mode, bistable phenomenon, square, hexagon, black eye, two-phase oscillating staggered hexagon lattice, and other complex spatiotemporal patterns. The theoretical predictions are verified by numerical simulations showing an excellent agreement with many reported experiment results not only in chemistry but also in physics and biology. Results presented in this article reveal the mechanism of generating the spatiotemporal patterns of the CIMA reaction.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A method for computing the Riesz [math]-capacity, [math], of a general set [math] is given. The method is based on simulations of isotropic [math]-stable motion paths in [math]-dimensions. The familiar walk-on-spheres method, often utilized for simulating Brownian motion, is modified to a novel walk-in-and-out-of-balls method adapted for modeling the stable path process on the exterior of regions “probed” by this type of generalized random walk. It accounts for the propensity of this class of random walk to jump through boundaries because of the path discontinuity. This method allows for the computationally efficient simulation of hitting locations of stable paths launched from the exterior of probed sets. Reliable methods of computing capacity from these locations are given, along with non-standard confidence intervals. Illustrative calculations are performed for representative types of sets [math], where both [math] and [math] are varied.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This paper studies the soliton dynamics for the Rabi-coupled Gross–Pitaevskii model in multicomponent Bose–Einstein condensates. The model has variable nonlinearities and external potentials and is used to construct a complex multisoliton in an explicit form. The variable nonlinearity and external potential cause the soliton to compress and change its velocity, respectively. A new generalized similarity transformation is proposed to eliminate the [math] Rabi-coupled terms in the [math]-component model, which can make the Hirota bilinear method be applied to obtain multisoliton solutions. The bound state of the two-soliton forms the soliton molecule under velocity resonance. Asymptotic analysis can give the asymptotic expressions of each single soliton in multisoliton solutions, which can clearly give each soliton’s width, velocity, amplitude, and energy; these parameters can control multisolitons. When the solitons’ relative velocity or the solitons’ width is large, the interferogram between solitons will be observed. Numerical simulation shows that these solitons can steadily propagate. It is easy for the soliton molecule and interference dynamics to occur because of the controlled soliton. Since the coupled Gross–Pitaevskii equation describes the mechanics of matter waves in Bose–Einstein condensates, it is proved that we can observe the stable solitons and soliton molecules in Bose–Einstein condensates. The method and results presented in this paper are also common to other similar models. When observing particle multiple distributions, quantum interferometry, and interferometers, the results presented and the model in this paper can provide a reference for these applications.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This is the second paper in a series of two. The goal of the series is to give a polynomial-time algorithm for the 4-coloring problem and the 4-precoloring extension problem restricted to the class of graphs with no induced six-vertex path, thus proving a conjecture of Huang. Combined with previously known results, this completes the classification of the complexity of the 4-coloring problem for graphs with a connected forbidden induced subgraph. In this paper we give a polynomial time-algorithm that starts with a 4-precoloring of a graph with no induced six-vertex path and outputs a polynomial-sized collection of so-called excellent precolorings. Excellent precolorings are easier to handle than general ones, and, in addition, in order to determine whether the initial precoloring can be extended to the whole graph, it is enough to answer the same question for each of the excellent precolorings in the collection. The first paper in the series deals with excellent precolorings, thus providing a complete solution to the problem.]]></summary>

Anderson acceleration (AA) is widely used for accelerating the convergence of nonlinear fixed-point methods, but little is known about how to quantify the asymptotic convergence acceleration provided by AA. As a roadway towards gaining more understanding of convergence acceleration by AA, we study AA(m), i.e., Anderson acceleration with finite window size m, applied to the case of linear fixed-point iterations. We write AA(m) as a Krylov method with polynomial residual update formulas, and derive

We apply these results to study AA(1) residual convergence patterns and the influence of the initial guess on the asymptotic convergence factor.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Coarse-graining or model reduction is a term describing a range of approaches used to extend the timescale of molecular simulations by reducing the number of degrees of freedom. In the context of molecular simulation, standard coarse-graining approaches approximate the potential of mean force and use this to drive an effective Markovian model. To gain insight into this process, the simple case of a quadratic energy is studied in an overdamped setting. A hierarchy of reduced models is derived and analyzed, and the merits of these different coarse-graining approaches are discussed. In particular, while standard recipes for model reduction accurately capture static equilibrium statistics, it is shown that dynamical statistics, such as the mean-squared displacement, display systematic error, even when a system exhibits large timescale separation. In the linear setting studied, it is demonstrated both analytically and numerically that such models can be augmented in a simple way to better capture dynamical statistics.]]></summary>

If the matrix multiplication exponent [math] is not 2, our generator has seed length [math] and hits circuits of size [math] for sufficiently small [math].

Because of the underlying geometry, this model is natural for applications in data science and beyond. We investigate the problem of testing for this latent geometry, or, in other words, distinguishing an Erdős–Rényi graph [math] from a random geometric graph [math]. It is not too difficult to show that if [math] while [math] is held fixed,…]]></summary>

 Abstract. This is the first paper in a series whose goal is to give a polynomial-time algorithm for the 4-coloring problem and the 4-precoloring extension problem restricted to the class of graphs with no induced six-vertex path, thus proving a conjecture of Huang. Combined with previously known results, this completes the classification of the complexity of the 4-coloring problem for graphs with a connected forbidden induced subgraph. In this paper we give a polynomial-time algorithm that determines if a special kind of precoloring of a [math]-free graph has a precoloring extension, and constructs such an extension if one exists. Combined with the main result of the second paper of the series, this gives a complete solution to the problem.]]></summary>

 Abstract. There are two main approaches to modelling interfaces within nonequilibrium thermodynamics, the so-called sharp and diffuse interface models. Both of them are based on the local equilibrium assumption (LEA) in the bulk, but the latter additionally assumes the validity of this concept also within the interface itself (as the thermodynamic description is available and smoothly varying even within the interface), that is, on a finer length scale, which we call super-LEA. Instead of testing the two approaches against molecular dynamic simulations, we explore the mutual compatibility of these two descriptions of an interface in a nonequilibrium situation. Based on the level of detail in the two framework…]]></summary>

 Abstract.A class of four-component reaction-diffusion systems are studied in one spatial dimension, with one of four specific reaction kinetics. Models of this type seek to capture the interaction between active and inactive forms of two G-proteins, known as ROPs in plants, thought to underly cellular polarity formation. The systems conserve total concentration of each ROP, which enables reduction to simple canonical forms when one seeks conditions for homogeneous equilibria or heteroclinic connections between them. Transitions between different multiplicities of such states are classified using a novel application of catastrophe theory. For the time-dependent problem, the heteroclinic connections represent so-called wave-pinned states that separate regions of the domain with different ROP concentrations. It is shown numerically how the form of wave-pinning reached can be predicted as a function of the domain size and initial total ROP concentrations. This leads to state diagrams of different polarity forms as a function of total concentrations and system parameters.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We relate discrepancy theory with the classic scheduling problems of minimizing max flow time and total flow time on unrelated machines. Specifically, we give a general reduction that allows us to transfer discrepancy bounds in the prefix Beck–Fiala (bounded [math]-norm) setting to bounds on the flow time of an optimal schedule. Combining our reduction with a deep result proved by Banaszczyk via convex geometry gives guarantees of [math] and [math] for max flow time and total flow time, respectively, improving upon the previous best guarantees of [math] and [math]. Apart from the improved guarantees, the reduction motivates seemingly easy versions of prefix discrepancy questions: any constant bound on prefix Beck–Fiala where vectors have sparsity two (sparsity one being trivial) would already yield tight guarantees for both max flow time and total flow time. While known techniques solve this case when the entries take values in [math], we show that they are unlikely to transfer to the more general 2-sparse case of bounded [math]-norm.]]></summary>

We consider the Davey–Stewartson system in the hyperbolic–elliptic case (DS-II) in two dimensional case. It is a mass-critical equation, and was proved recently by Nachman et al. (Invent Math 220(2):395–451, 2020) the global well-posedness and scattering in

                    . In this paper, we give the numerical study on this model and construct a first order low-regularity integrator for the DS-II in the periodic case. It only requires the boundedness of one additional derivative of the solution to get the first order convergence. The Fast Fourier Transform is exploited to speed up the numerical implementation. By rigorous error analysis, we prove that the numerical scheme provides first order convergence in

Motivated by the PageRank model for graph partitioning, we develop an extension of PageRank for partitioning uniform hypergraphs. Starting from adjacency tensors of uniform hypergraphs, we establish the multi-linear pseudo-PageRank (MLPPR) model, which is formulated as a multi-linear system with nonnegative constraints. The coefficient tensor of MLPPR is a kind of Laplacian tensors of uniform hypergraphs, which are almost as sparse as adjacency tensors since no dangling corrections are incorporated. Furthermore, all frontal slices of the coefficient tensor of MLPPR are M-matrices. Theoretically, MLPPR has a solution, which is unique under mild conditions. An error bound of the MLPPR solution is analyzed when the Laplacian tensor is slightly perturbed. Computationally, by exploiting the structural Laplacian tensor, we propose a tensor splitting algorithm, which converges linearly to a solution of MLPPR. Finally, numerical experiments illustrate that MLPPR is effective and efficient for hypergraph partitioning problems.]]></summary>

Combining ETDRK3 with a second-order scheme ETDRK2, we proposed an adaptive ETDRK method(ETDRK32).

In this paper, an oscillation-free spectral volume (OFSV) method is proposed and studied for the hyperbolic conservation laws. The numerical scheme is designed by introducing a damping term in the standard spectral volume method for the purpose of controlling spurious oscillations near discontinuities. Based on the construction of control volumes (CVs), two classes of OFSV schemes are presented. A mathematical proof is provided to show that the proposed OFSV is stable and has optimal convergence rate and some desired superconvergence properties when applied to the linear scalar equations. Both analysis and numerical experiments indicate that the damping term would not destroy the order of accuracy of the original SV scheme and can control the oscillations near discontinuities effectively. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our scheme.]]></summary>

We introduce finite difference time domain (FDTD) methods for solving the Dirac equation coupled with the Chern–Simons gauge field and provide their error estimates. To discretize the spinor equation, we utilize well-known FDTD schemes, including the Crank–Nicolson method, leap-frog method, and semi-implicit methods. On the other hand, to discretize the gauge equations, we mainly employ the Lorenz gauge condition and derive Crank–Nicolson or leap-frog type finite difference methods for the gauge equations. We establish the error estimates for the introduced FDTD methods and prove the second-order accuracy both in space and time. Numerical examples are also presented to validate the second-order convergence and illustrate the dependencies of the numerical solutions on the parameters or gauge conditions.]]></summary>

We propose a new parallel discontinuous Galerkin method for the approximation of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. The method remains stable with large time steps, while keeping the complexity of an explicit scheme: it does not require the assembly and resolution of large linear systems for the time iterations. The approach is based on a kinetic representation of the system of conservation laws previously investigated by the authors. Coulette et al.

We strengthen the above lower bound to an average-case one, by proving that for all constants [math], there is a language in [math] that cannot be [math]-approximated by polynomial-size [math] circuits. Our work also improves the average-case lower bound for [math] against polynomial-size [math] circuits by [R. Chen, I. C. Oliveira, and R. Santhanam, LATIN 2018, …]]></summary>

In contrast to the conventional entanglement-separability paradigm in quantum information theory, we embark on a different path by introducing a classical dichotomy. We aim to quantify a measurement’s disturbance by minimizing the difference between input and post-measurement states to distinguish either classical or quantum correlations. Theoretically, we apply a complex-valued gradient flow over Stiefel manifolds for minimization. Our focus extends beyond the practical application to encompass the well-known Łojasiewicz gradient inequality. This inequality is a fundamental tool that guarantees the global convergence of the flow from any initial starting point to the optimal solution. Numerically, we validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method by performing a series of experiments in different scenarios. Experimental results suggest the capability of our approach to accurately and reliably characterize correlations as classical or quantum.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We consider the problem of clustering mixtures of mean-separated Gaussians in high dimensions. We are given samples from a mixture of [math] identity covariance Gaussians, so that the minimum pairwise distance between any two pairs of means is at least [math], for some parameter [math], and the goal is to recover the ground truth clustering of these samples. It is folklore that separation [math] is both necessary and sufficient to recover a good clustering (say, with constant or [math] error), at least information-theoretically. However, the estimators which achieve this guarantee are inefficient. We give the first algorithm which runs in polynomial time in both [math] and the dimension [math], and which almost matches this guarantee. More precisely, we give an algorithm which takes polynomially many samples and time, and which can successfully recover a good clustering, so long as the separation is [math], for any [math]. Previously, polynomial time algorithms were only known for this problem when the separation was polynomial in [math], and all algorithms which could tolerate [math] separation required quasipolynomial time. We also extend our result to mixtures of translations of a distribution which satisfies the Poincaré inequality, under additional mild assumptions. Our main technical tool, which we believe is of independent interest, is a novel way to implicitly represent and estimate high degree moments of a distribution, which allows us to extract important information about high degree moments without ever writing down the full moment tensors explicitly.]]></summary>

Discrete wavelet methods, originally formulated in the setting of regularly sampled signals, can be adapted to data defined on a point cloud if some multiresolution structure is imposed on the cloud. A wide variety of hierarchical clustering algorithms can be used for this purpose, and the multiresolution structure obtained can be encoded by a hierarchical tree of subsets of the cloud. Prior work introduced the use of Haar-like bases defined with respect to such trees for approximation and learning tasks on unstructured data. This paper builds on that work in two directions. First, we present an algorithm for constructing Haar-like bases on general discrete hierarchical trees. Second, with an eye towards data compression, we present thresholding techniques for data defined on a point cloud with error controlled in the

The two species are supposed to be identical except for the diffusion rates. For each species, the diffusion rates between patches are the same, while the drift rates vary. Our results show that the convexity of the drift rates has a significant impact on the competition outcomes: if the drift rates are convex, then the species with the larger diffusion rate wins the competition; if the drift rates are concave, then the species with the smaller diffusion rate wins the competition.]]></summary>

Abstract.To model a single-species cognitive movement, we formulate a reaction-diffusion equation with nonlocal spatial memory and investigate its dynamics. We explore the influence of the perceptual scale on the stability and Turing bifurcation. When the random diffusion is dominant, the perceptual scale does not affect the stability, but when the memory-based diffusion is dominant, there exist Turing bifurcations induced by the perceptual scale. Then the joint effect of the perceptual scale and the memory delay on the stability and spatio-temporal dynamics is investigated to show rich spatio-temporal dynamics via Turing–Hopf bifurcation and double Hopf bifurcation. Finally, we apply our analysis to an application and illustrate our theoretical results with numerical simulations.]]></summary>

 Abstract.We present a geometrical description of the symmetries and reduction of the full gravitational 2-body problem after complete averaging over fast angles. Our variables allow for a well-suited formulation in action-angle type coordinates associated with the averaged angles, which provide geometric insight into the problem. After introducing extra fictitious variables and through a symplectic transformation, we move to a singularity-free quaternionic triple-chart. This choice allows for a global chart to avoid the classical singularities associated with angles and renders all the invariants as homogeneous quadratic polynomials. Additionally, it permits one to quickly write the Hamiltonian of the system in terms of the invariants and the Poisson structure at each stage of the reduction process. In contrast with existing literature, the geometrical approach of this research completely describes all the dynamical aspects of the full reduced space since it involves the relative position of the rotational and orbital angular momenta and their orientation, which has yet to be considered in previous studies. Our program includes a preliminary parametric analysis of relative equilibria and a complete description of the fibers in the reconstruction of the reduced system.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In the Maximum Independent Set problem we are asked to find a set of pairwise nonadjacent vertices in a given graph with the maximum possible cardinality. In general graphs, this classical problem is known to be NP-hard and hard to approximate within a factor of [math] for any [math]. Due to this, investigating the complexity of Maximum Independent Set in various graph classes in hope of finding better tractability results is an active research direction. In [math]-free graphs, that is, graphs not containing a fixed graph [math] as an induced subgraph, the problem is known to remain NP-hard and APX-hard whenever [math] contains a cycle, a vertex of degree at least four, or two vertices of degree at least three in one connected component. For the remaining cases, where every component of [math] is a path or a subdivided claw, the complexity of Maximum Independent Set remains widely open, with only a handful of polynomial-time solvability results for small graphs [math] such as [math], [math], the claw, or the fork. We prove that for every such “possibly tractable” graph [math] there exists an algorithm that, given an [math]-free graph [math] and an accuracy parameter [math], finds an independent set in [math] of cardinality within a factor of [math] of the optimum in time exponential in a polynomial of [math] and [math]. Furthermore, an independent set of maximum size can be found in subexponential time [math]. That is, we show that for every graph [math] for which Maximum Independent Set is not known to be APX-hard and SUBEXP-hard in [math]-free graphs, the problem admits a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme and a subexponential-time exact algorithm in this graph class. Our algorithms also work in the more general weighted setting, where the input graph is supplied with a weight function on vertices and we are maximizing the total weight of an independent set.]]></summary>

Transfer learning for partial differential equations (PDEs) is to develop a pre-trained neural network that can be used to solve a wide class of PDEs. Existing transfer learning approaches require much information about the target PDEs such as its formulation and/or data of its solution for pre-training. In this work, we propose to design transferable neural feature spaces for the shallow neural networks from purely function approximation perspectives without using PDE information. The construction of the feature space involves the re-parameterization of the hidden neurons and uses auxiliary functions to tune the resulting feature space. Theoretical analysis shows the high quality of the produced feature space, i.e., uniformly distributed neurons. We use the proposed feature space as the pre-determined feature space of a random feature model, and use existing least squares solvers to obtain the weights of the output layer. Extensive numerical experiments verify the outstanding performance of our method, including significantly improved transferability, e.g., using the same feature space for various PDEs with different domains and boundary conditions, and the superior accuracy, e.g., several orders of magnitude smaller mean squared error than the state of the art methods.]]></summary>

First-order hydrostatic reconstruction (HR) schemes for shallow water equations are highly diffusive whereas high-order schemes can produce entropy-violating solutions. Our goal is to develop a flux correction with maximum antidiffusive fluxes to obtain entropy solutions of shallow water equations with variable bottom topography. For this purpose, we consider a hybrid explicit HR scheme whose flux is a convex combination of first-order Rusanov flux and high-order flux. The conditions under which the explicit first-order HR scheme for shallow water equations satisfies the fully discrete entropy inequality have been studied. The flux limiters for the hybrid scheme are calculated from a corresponding optimization problem. Constraints for the optimization problem consist of inequalities that are valid for the first-order HR scheme and applied to the hybrid scheme. We apply the discrete cell entropy inequality with the proper numerical entropy flux to single out a physically relevant solution to the shallow water equations. A nontrivial approximate solution of the optimization problem yields expressions to compute the required flux limiters. Numerical results of testing various HR schemes on different benchmarks are presented.]]></summary>
