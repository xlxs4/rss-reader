 Abstract. This paper concerns the derivation of radiative transfer equations for acoustic waves propagating in a randomly fluctuating half-space in the weak-scattering regime, and the study of boundary effects through an asymptotic analysis of the Wigner transform of the wave solution. These radiative transfer equations allow one to model the transport of wave energy density, taking into account the scattering by random heterogeneities. The approach builds on the method of images, where the half-space problem is extended to a full-space, with two symmetric sources and an even map of mechanical properties. Two contributions to the total energy density are then identified: one similar to the energy density propagation in a full-space, for which the resulting lack of statistical stationarity of the medium properties has no leading-order effect; and one supported within one wavelength of the boundary, which describes interference effects between the waves produced by the two symmetric sources. In the case of a homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, this boundary effect yields a doubling of the intensity, and in the case of homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, a canceling of that intensity.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We analyze the searching strategies of a forager diffusing in the whole space via an equation of fractional type. Specifically, the diffusion of the forager is regulated by a Lévy flight whose exponent can be chosen in order to optimize a suitable foraging efficiency functional. Here, the dimension of the space is arbitrary. On the one hand, we show that the exponent [math] corresponding to the limit case of heavy-tailed Lévy flights is a pessimizer for the efficiency functional. On the other hand, we prove that, in situations of biological interest, one finds the most rewarding strategies arbitrarily close to [math]. The combination of these results gives that the most rewarding searching option may turn out to be unfeasible, or at least unreliable, in practice, since small perturbations of the optimal searching exponent lead to pessimal patterns. The cases analyzed specifically are those of a target located in the proximity of the forager and that of sparse prey modeled by a target infinitely far from the initial position of the seeker. The efficiency functionals taken into account are either of pointwise type (in which the predator and the prey are modeled by moving points) or of set-dependent type (in which the predator and the prey correspond to regions of space with uniform density, thus modeling also the case of a sight range of the biological individuals involved). To implement our analysis, we also provide a number of structural results about finiteness, continuity, and asymptotic behaviors of the efficiency functionals. It is suggestive to relate the adoption of the most rewarding searching pattern close to pessimizers to a “high-risk/high-gain” strategy, in which the forager aims at high-energy content prey to mitigate the risk of failure. This setting is also connected to foraging modes of “ambush” type.]]></summary>

The networks are trained with data obtained from simulations of a standard benchmark problem with linear finite elements.

We present a discontinuity detection method based on the so-called null rules, computed as a vector in the null space of certain collocation matrices. These rules are used as weights in a linear combination of function evaluations to indicate the local behavior of the function itself. By analyzing the asymptotic properties of the rules, we introduce two indicators (one for discontinuities of the function and one for discontinuities of its gradient) by locally computing just one rule. This leads to an efficient and reliable scheme, which allows us to effectively detect and classify points close to discontinuities. We then show how this information can be suitably combined with adaptive approximation methods based on hierarchical spline spaces in the reconstruction process of surfaces with discontinuities. The considered adaptive methods exploit the ability of the hierarchical spaces to be locally refined, and fault detection is a natural way to guide the refinement with low computational cost. A selection of test cases is presented to show the effectiveness of our approach.]]></summary>

Inspired by several numerical methods for finding multiple solutions, a partial Newton-correction method (PNCM) is proposed to find multiple fixed points of semi-linear differential operators. First a new augmented singular transform is developed to form a barrier so that an algorithm search outside the subspace generated by previously found fixed points cannot pass the barrier and penetrate into the inside to reach an old fixed point. Thus a fixed point found by an algorithm must be new. Its mathematical validations are established. A flow chart of PNCM is presented. Then a more accurate Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto pseudospectral scheme is constructed and convertes a semi-linear fixed point problem into a linear partial differential equation and an algebraic equation. It greatly simplifies the computation. Finally numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of these approaches.]]></summary>

Explicit step-truncation tensor methods have recently proven successful in integrating initial value problems for high-dimensional partial differential equations. However, the combination of non-linearity and stiffness may introduce time-step restrictions which could make explicit integration computationally infeasible. To overcome this problem, we develop a new class of implicit rank-adaptive algorithms for temporal integration of nonlinear evolution equations on tensor manifolds. These algorithms are based on performing one time step with a conventional time-stepping scheme, followed by an implicit fixed point iteration step involving a rank-adaptive truncation operation onto a tensor manifold. Implicit step truncation methods are straightforward to implement as they rely only on arithmetic operations between tensors, which can be performed by efficient and scalable parallel algorithms. Numerical applications demonstrating the effectiveness of implicit step-truncation tensor integrators are presented and discussed for the Allen–Cahn equation, the Fokker–Planck equation, and the nonlinear Schrödinger equation.]]></summary>

Thanks to their universal approximation properties and new efficient training strategies, Deep Neural Networks are becoming a valuable tool for the approximation of mathematical operators. In the present work, we introduce Mesh-Informed Neural Networks (MINNs), a class of architectures specifically tailored to handle mesh based functional data, and thus of particular interest for reduced order modeling of parametrized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The driving idea behind MINNs is to embed hidden layers into discrete functional spaces of increasing complexity, obtained through a sequence of meshes defined over the underlying spatial domain. The approach leads to a natural pruning strategy which enables the design of sparse architectures that are able to learn general nonlinear operators. We assess this strategy through an extensive set of numerical experiments, ranging from nonlocal operators to nonlinear diffusion PDEs, where MINNs are compared against more traditional architectures, such as classical fully connected Deep Neural Networks, but also more recent ones, such as DeepONets and Fourier Neural Operators. Our results show that MINNs can handle functional data defined on general domains of any shape, while ensuring reduced training times, lower computational costs, and better generalization capabilities, thus making MINNs very well-suited for demanding applications such as Reduced Order Modeling and Uncertainty Quantification for PDEs.]]></summary>

A major advantage of AS-PAL compared to other AL methods is that it requires no knowledge of parameters (e.g., size of constraint matrix, objective function curvatures, etc) associated with the optimization problem, due to its adaptive nature not only in choosing the prox stepsize but also in using a crucial adaptive accelerated composite gradient variant to solve the proximal AL subproblems. The speed and efficiency of AS-PAL is demonstrated through extensive computational experiments showing that it can solve many instances more than ten times faster than other state-of-the-art penalty and AL methods, particularly when high accuracy is required.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper we analyze the narrow capture problem for a single Brownian particle diffusing in a three-dimensional (3D) bounded domain containing a set of small, spherical traps. The boundary surface of each trap is taken to be a semipermeable membrane. That is, the continuous flux across the interface is proportional to an associated jump discontinuity in the probability density. The constant of proportionality is identified with the permeability [math]. In addition, we allow for discontinuities in the diffusivity and chemical potential across each interface; the latter introduces a directional bias. We also assume that the particle can be absorbed (captured) within the interior of each trap…]]></summary>

 Abstract. We consider the inverse time-harmonic elastic source problems with multifrequency sparse far field patterns. The unknown multiscale object is a combination of point sources and an extended source with compact support. Even if the extended source is unknown, we prove that the locations and the polarization strengths of the point sources can be uniquely determined by the multifrequency far field patterns at sparse observations. The least number of observation directions is given in terms of the number of the point sources. Having identified the point sources, under certain conditions, we further show that the multifrequency far field patterns at a fixed observation direction uniquely determine the narrowest strip containing the source support. With the increase of the number of observation directions, a convex hull of the source support can be obtained. Based on the constructive uniqueness proof, we introduce a novel direct sampling method both for locating the point sources and for reconstructing the support of the extended source. A formula for computing the polarization strengths is also given. Numerical examples in two dimensions are presented to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methods for multiscale elastic sources.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we study a tumor-immune system interaction model with dendritic cell therapy and immune response delay. First, it is shown that the ODE version of the model has a Bogdanov–Takens (BT) singularity or a weak focus with multiplicity at most 1 for different parameter values. As the parameters vary, the ODE model undergoes supercritical Hopf bifurcation and supercritical BT bifurcation. Our analysis indicates that there exists a threshold value of the activation rate of T cells, below which tumor immune escape occurs, above or at which T cells and tumor cells coexist in the form of a stable periodic oscillation or steady state. Second, we study how the immune response delay affects the dynamics of the model. Our results reveal that the delay can destabilize the stable positive equilibrium through Hopf bifurcation. Furthermore, the direction and stability of Hopf bifurcation are derived. When there is a cusp, we show that it is a BT singularity for any delay and the delay model also undergoes BT bifurcation. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
In this paper, a modified a posteriori limiter is developed for high order flux reconstruction (FR) scheme for the numerical simulation of detonation problems. In this limiting procedure, the unlimited FR solution at the new time step will be checked first by using some detection criteria, then the solution in the troubled cells are recomputed with a robust subcell finite volume (FV) scheme. The detection criteria for identifying troubled cells consist of the physical admissibility (e.g., positivity of density and pressure) and numerical admissibility (e.g., non-oscillating). We modify the detection criteria by using the KXRCF shock detector prior to the relaxed discrete maximum principle. This can track the troubled cells near strong shocks consecutively so as to improve the steady state convergence and can reduce the number of overly marked troubled cells. The subcell correction procedure endows the high order FR scheme the capability to capture discontinuities inside a cell without generating spurious oscillations. A series of one-dimensional numerical tests are carried out to assess the effectiveness of the proposed limiter. In particular, one-dimensional detonation wave problems with the overdriven factor f = 1.8–1.3 are calculated using third to sixth order accurate FR schemes in conjunction with the first order Godunov or second order TVD subcell FV scheme. It is shown that the FR schemes with the present a posteriori limiter can compute strong detonation waves robustly, and the third order FR scheme with the second order TVD subcell FV limiter has better resolution of detonation waves compared with the fifth order WENO-Z scheme under same degree of freedoms.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We investigate the unbiased model for money exchanges with collective debt limit: agents give at random time a dollar to one another as long as they have at least one dollar or they can borrow a dollar from a central bank if the bank is not empty. Surprisingly, this dynamic eventually leads to an asymmetric Laplace distribution of wealth (conjectured in [N. Xi, N. Ding, and Y. Wang, Phys. A, 357 (2005), pp. 543–555]  and shown formally in a recent work [N. Lanchier and S. Reed, J. Stat. Phys., 176 (2019), pp. 1115–1137]). In this manuscript, we carry out a formal mean-field limit as the number of agents goes to infinity where we uncover a two-phase ODE dynamic. Convergence towards the unique equilibrium (two-sided geometric) distribution in the large time limit is also shown and the role played by the bank and debt (in terms of Gini index or wealth inequality) will be explored numerically as well.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We review existing approaches to optimizing the deployment of genetic biocontrol technologies—tools used to prevent vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue—and formulate a mathematical program that enables the incorporation of crucial ecological and logistical details. The model is comprised of equality constraints grounded in discretized dynamic population equations, inequality constraints representative of operational limitations including resource restrictions, and an objective function that jointly minimizes the count of competent mosquito vectors and the number of transgenic organisms released to mitigate them over a specified time period. We explore how nonlinear programming (NLP) and mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) can advance the state of the art in designing the operational implementation of three distinct transgenic public health interventions, two of which are presently in active use around the world.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
This paper aims to propose a complete superconvergence analysis for a postprocessing technique based on collocation methods for fractional differential equations (FDEs). We start with the simple linear FDEs with Caputo derivative of order 
                      
                      \(0<\alpha <1\)
                      
                    . The problem is reformulated as a weakly singular Volterra integral equation (VIE), and based on the resolvent theory of VIEs, the existence, uniqueness and regularity for the exact solution for the original FDE are obtained. Then the piecewise polynomial collocation method is adopted to solve the reformulated VIE, and based on the regularity of the original FDE, the convergence for the collocation method and the superconvergence for the iterated collocation method are investigated in detail, respectively. Further, based on the obtained collocation solution, the interpolation postprocessing approximation of higher accuracy is constructed on graded mesh, and the superconvergence is obtained. Compared with classical iterated collocation method, the cost on computation of interpolation postprocessing technique is less. Numerical experiments are given to illustrate the theoretical results, and it is also shown that the proposed postprocessing technique can be extended to certain nonlinear and systems of FDEs.]]></summary>

In this article, we present a low numerical dissipation non-staggered central scheme for the Riemann problems in hyperbolic conservation laws and convection–diffusion equations. The main disadvantage of classical non-staggered central schemes is their relatively large numerical dissipation, which will cause numerical solutions to be excessively smooth at discontinuities and large gradients, especially when small time steps are forced by CFL numbers. The presented scheme reduces the numerical dissipation through introducing a time–space dependent parameter

In this work, a conservative sharp-interface numerical method is developed to simulate compressible two-medium flows with a free interface. In the method, the cut-cell method is introduced to achieve a sharp interface. To avoid the complicated geometric cell merging approach in the cut-cell method, the small cut cells are updated using a flux/conserved variable merging/mixing method that considers the type of small cut cells (general, singular, and vanished). In addition, the residual conserved quantity is redistributed to ensure conservation during the re-initialization process of the level set function. Moreover, to handle thin or small-scale structures where the numerical oscillation may appear, the mixing cut-cell and ghost fluid method is adopted to update these cut cells with a conserved variables mixing approach. Various numerical tests are performed to verify the conservation and robustness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

 Abstract. While the hexagonal lattice is ubiquitous in two dimensions, the body centered cubic lattice (BCC lattice) and the face centered cubic lattice are both commonly observed in three dimensions. A geometric variational problem motivated by the diblock copolymer theory consists of a short-range interaction energy and a long-range interaction energy. In three dimensions, and when the long range interaction is given by the nonlocal operator [math], it is proved that the BCC lattice is the preferred structure.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This work addresses the modelling of oxygenic photogranules (OPGs), by introducing a mathematical model which describes both the genesis and growth of photogranules and the related treatment process. The photogranule has been modelled as a free boundary domain with radial symmetry, which evolves over time as a result of microbial growth, attachment, and detachment processes. Hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs have been considered to model at mesoscale the transport and growth of sessile biomass and the diffusion and conversion of soluble substrates. The macroscale behavior of the system has been modelled through first order impulsive ordinary differential equations (IDEs), which reproduce a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) configuration. Phototrophic biomass has been considered for the first time in granular biofilms, and cyanobacteria and microalgae have been accounted separately, to model their metabolic differences. To describe the key role of cyanobacteria in the photogranulation process, the attachment velocity of all suspended microbial species has been modelled as a function of the cyanobacteria concentration in suspended form. The model takes into account the main biological processes involved in OPG-based systems: metabolic activity of cyanobacteria, microalgae, heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria, microbial decay, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secretion, symbiotic and competitive interactions between different species, light-dark cycle, light attenuation across the granule, and photoinhibition phenomena. The model has been integrated numerically, and the results show its consistency in describing the photogranule evolution and ecology, and highlight the advantages of the OPG technology, analyzing the effects of the influent wastewater composition and light conditions on the process.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, a multiscale constitutive framework for one-dimensional blood flow modeling is presented and discussed. By analyzing the asymptotic limits of the proposed model, it is shown that different types of blood propagation phenomena in arteries and veins can be described through an appropriate choice of scaling parameters, which are related to distinct characterizations of the fluid-structure interaction mechanism (whether elastic or viscoelastic) that exist between vessel walls and blood flow. In these asymptotic limits, well-known blood flow models from the literature are recovered. Additionally, by analyzing the perturbation of the local elastic equilibrium of the system, a new viscoelastic blood flow model is derived. The proposed approach is highly flexible and suitable for studying the human cardiovascular system, which is composed of vessels with high morphological and mechanical variability. The resulting multiscale hyperbolic model of blood flow is solved using an asymptotic-preserving implicit-explicit Runge–Kutta finite volume method, which ensures the consistency of the numerical scheme with the different asymptotic limits of the mathematical model without affecting the choice of the time step by restrictions related to the smallness of the scaling parameters. Several numerical tests confirm the validity of the proposed methodology, including a case study investigating the hemodynamics of a thoracic aorta in the presence of a stent.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Motivated by the modeling of customer mobility and congestion in supermarkets, we study queueing networks with a single source and a single sink. We assume that walkers traverse a network according to an unbiased random walk, and we analyze how network topology affects the total mean queue size [math], which we use to measure congestion. We examine network topologies that minimize [math] and provide proofs of optimality for some cases and numerical evidence of optimality for others. Finally, we present greedy algorithms that add edges to and delete edges from a network to reduce [math], and we apply these algorithms to a network that we construct using a supermarket store layout. We find that these greedy algorithms, which typically tend to add edges to the sink node, are able to significantly reduce [math]. Our work helps improve understanding of how to design networks with low congestion and how to amend networks to reduce congestion.]]></summary>

The Laplace–Beltrami problem on closed surfaces embedded in three dimensions arises in many areas of physics, including molecular dynamics (surface diffusion), electromagnetics (harmonic vector fields), and fluid dynamics (vesicle deformation). Using classical potential theory, the Laplace–Beltrami operator can be pre-/post-conditioned with an integral operator whose kernel is translation invariant, resulting in well-conditioned Fredholm integral equations of the second-kind. These equations have the standard 1/r kernel from potential theory, and therefore the equations can be solved rapidly and accurately using a combination of fast multipole methods (FMMs) and high-order quadrature corrections. In this work we detail such a scheme, presenting two alternative integral formulations of the Laplace–Beltrami problem, each of whose solution can be obtained via FMM acceleration. We then present several applications of the solvers, focusing on the computation of what are known as harmonic vector fields, relevant for many applications in electromagnetics. A battery of numerical results are presented for each application, detailing the performance of the solver in various geometries.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This work is devoted to the construction of multiscale numerical schemes efficient in the finite Larmor radius approximation of the collisional Vlasov equation. Following the paper of Bostan and Finot [Commun. Contemp. Math., 22 (2020), 1950047], the system involves two different regimes, a highly oscillatory and a dissipative regime, whose asymptotic limits do not commute. In this work, we consider a Particle-in-Cell discretization of the collisional Vlasov system which enables us to deal with the multiscale characteristics equations. Different multiscale time integrators are then constructed and analyzed. We prove asymptotic properties of these schemes in the highly oscillatory regime and in the collisional regime. In particular, the asymptotic preserving property towards the modified equilibrium of the averaged collision operator is recovered. Numerical experiments are then shown to illustrate the properties of the numerical schemes.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Random walks represent an important tool for probing the structural and dynamical properties of networks and modeling transport and diffusion processes on networks. However, when individuals’ movements become dictated by more complicated factors, e.g., scenarios that involve complex decision making, the linear paradigm of classical random walks lacks the ability to capture dynamically rich behaviors. One modification that addresses this issue is to allow transition probabilities to depend on the current system state, resulting in a nonlinear random walk. While the resulting nonlinearity has been shown to give rise to an array of more complex dynamics, the patterns that emerge, in particular on regular network topologies, remain unexplored and poorly understood. Here we study nonlinear random walks on regular networks. We present a number of stability results for the uniform state where random walkers are uniformly distributed throughout the network, characterizing the spectral properties of its Jacobian which we use to characterize its bifurcations. These spectral properties may also be used to understand the patterns that emerge beyond bifurcations, which consist of oscillating short wavelength patterns and localized structures for negative and positive bias, respectively. We also uncover a subcriticality in the bifurcation for positive bias, leading to a hysteresis loop and multistability.]]></summary>

 Abstract. This work is focused on the modeling of signal propagations in myelinated axons to characterize the functions of the myelin sheath in the neural structure. Based on reasonable assumptions on the medium properties, we derive a two-dimensional neural-signaling model in cylindrical coordinates from the time-harmonic Maxwell equations. The well-posedness of the model is established upon Dirichlet boundary conditions at the two ends of the neural structure and the radiative condition in the radial direction of the structure. Using the perfectly matched layer (PML) method, we truncate the unbounded background medium and propose an approximate problem on the truncated domain. The well-posedness of the PML problem and the exponential convergence of the approximate solution to the exact solution are established. Numerical experiments based on finite element discretization are presented to demonstrate the theoretical results and the efficiency of our methods of simulating the signal propagation in axons.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rapid urban expansion presents a major challenge to delivering the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Urban populations are forecast to increase by 2.2 billion by 2050, and business as usual will condemn many of these new citizens to lives dominated by disaster risk. This need not be the case. Computational science can help urban planners and decision-makers to turn this threat into a time-limited opportunity to reduce disaster risk for hundreds of millions of people.]]></summary>
