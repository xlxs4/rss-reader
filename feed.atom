        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Structural DNA nanotechnology enables user-prescribed design of DNA nanostructures (DNs) for biological applications, but how DN design determines their bio-distribution and cellular interactions remain poorly understood. One challenge is that current methods for tracking DN fates in situ, including fluorescent-dye labeling, suffer from low sensitivity and dye-induced artifacts. Here we present origamiFISH, a label-free and universal method for single-molecule fluorescence detection of DNA origami nanostructures in cells and tissues. origamiFISH targets pan-DN scaffold sequences with hybridization chain reaction (HCR) probes to achieve thousand-fold signal amplification. We identify cell-type and shape-specific spatiotemporal uptake patterns within 1 minute of uptake and at picomolar DN concentrations, 10,000x lower than field standards. We additionally optimized compatibility with immunofluorescence and tissue clearing to visualize DN distribution within tissue cryo/vibratome-sections, slice cultures, and whole-mount organoids. Together, origamiFISH enables faithful mapping of DN interactions across subcellular and tissue barriers for guiding the development of DN-based therapeutics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shrews in the genus Episoriculus are among the least known mammals in China. It occurs mainly in the Himalayas and the Hengduan Mountains. We report the sequencing and analyses of one mitochondrial gene (Cyt b) and three nuclear genes (Apob, Brca1, and Rag2) for 77 specimens, and analyses of morphological measurements for 56 specimens. Phylogenetic and morphological studies answer three longstanding questions. First, Episoriculus sacratus and E. umbrinus are valid species, and not subspecies of E. caudatus. Second, Pseudosoriculus fumidus is a valid taxon that does not belong to the genus Episoriculus. Third, the genus Episoriculus has eight valid species: E. baileyi, E. caudatus, E. leucops, E. macrurus, E. sacratus, E. soluensis, Episoriculus sp., and E. umbrinus. Ultimately, we erected subgenus Longacauda subgen. nov. for morphologically distinct E. macrurus, which leaves the nominate subgenus Episoriculus with the remaining seven congeners.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For quantitative systems biology, simultaneous readout of multiple cellular processes as well as precise, independent control over different genes activities are essential. In contrast to readout systems such as fluorescent proteins, control systems such as inducible transcription-factor-promoter systems have only been characterized in an ad hoc fashion, impeding precise system-level manipulations of biological systems and reliable modeling.

We designed and performed systematic benchmarks involving easy-to-communicate units to characterize and compare inducible transcriptional systems. We built a comprehensive single-copy library of inducible systems controlling standardized fluorescent protein expression in budding yeast, including GAL1pr, GALL, MET3pr, CUP1pr, PHO5pr, tetOpr, terminator…]]></summary>

In this work, we construct a large-scale dynamic model of cell-free metabolism with the goal of understanding and optimizing butanol production in a cell-free system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In genome engineering, integration of incoming DNA has been dependent on enzymes produced by dividing cells which has been a bottle neck towards increasing DNA-insertion frequencies and accuracy. RNA-guided transposition with CRISPR-associated transposase (CAST) was shown to be highly effective and specific in Escherichia coli. Here we developed Golden-Gate vectors to test this approach in filamentous cyanobacteria and show that CAST is effective in Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120. The comparatively large plasmids containing the CAST and the engineered transposon were successfully transferred into Anabaena via conjugation using either suicide or replicative plasmids. Single guide RNA that target the leading, but not the reverse complement strand were effective with the protospacer associated motif (PAM) sequence included in the single guide RNA. In four out of six cases analyzed over two distinct target loci, the insertion site was exactly 63 bases after the PAM. CAST on a replicating plasmid was toxic which could be used to cure the plasmid. In all six cases analyzed, only the transposon defined by the sequence ranging from left and right elements was inserted at the target loci, therefore, RNA-guided transposition resulted from cut and paste. No endogenous transposons were remobilized by exposure to CAST enzymes. This work is foundational for genome editing by RNA-guided transposition in filamentous cyanobacteria, whether in culture or in complex communities.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As biotechnology research progresses from simply overexpressing proteins to creating intricate metabolic pathways, gene circuits, and complex phenotypes, harmonizing gene fitness in the context of a host organism has become essential. A significant amount of recent work has focused on decoupling gene expression from host resources to improve the outcome of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering efforts. While insightful, few of these studies have investigated the mechanistic underpinnings of resource allocation during translation elongation. There is a degeneracy in codons - but they are not equivalent. While there is an understanding that codon use is unequal in native genes, there is less knowledge of how this usage bias modulates the supply and demand of protein translation resources. Here we investigate how the partitioning of microbial translational resources, specifically through allocation of tRNA by incorporating dissimilar codon usage bias, can drastically alter expression of proteins and reduce the burden on the host resources. By isolating individual codons experimentally, we find heterologous gene expression can trans-regulate fitness of the host and other heterologous genes. Interestingly, specific codons drive profitable or catastrophic phenotypic outcomes. We correlate codon usage patterns with genetic fitness and empirically derive a novel coding scheme for multi-gene expression called Codon Harmony Index (CHI, {chi}). CHI enables the design of harmonious multi-gene expression systems while avoiding catastrophic cellular burden.]]></summary>

However, this technology is currently limited to members of the Spiroplasma phylogenetic group, mostly Mycoplasmas, within the Mollicute class. Here, we propose the development of these technologies for Acholeplasma laidlawii, which is phylogenetically distant from Mycoplasmas and, unlike most Mollicutes, uses a standard genetic code. Towards this goal, we first investigated a donor-recipient relationship between two A. laidlawii strains through whole-genome sequencing. We then created a multi-host shuttle plasmid and used it to optimize an electroporation protocol. For genome transplantation, we selected A. laidlawii 8195 as the recipient strain and we created a PG-8A donor strain by inserting a Tn5 transposon carrying a tetracycline resistance gene. Our optimized genetic tools will accelerate the creation of Acholeplasma strains driven by synthetic genomes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science, Volume 32, Issue 9, September 2022. 
A passive electrochemical coupling approach is proposed to induce spontaneous synchronization between chemical oscillators. The coupling exploits the potential difference between a catalyst redox couple in the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, without external feedback, to induce surface reactions that impact the kinetics of the bulk system. The effect of coupling in BZ oscillators under batch condition is characterized using phase synchronization measures. Although the frequency of the oscillators decreases nonlinearly over time, by a factor of 2 or more within 100 cycles, the coupling is strong enough to maintain synchronization. In such a highly drifting system, the Gibbs–Shannon entropy of the cyclic phase difference distribution can be used to quantify the coupling effect. We extend the Oregonator BZ model to account for the drifting natural frequencies in batch condition and for electrochemical coupling, and numerical simulations of the effect of acid concentration on synchronization patterns are in agreement with the experiments. Because of the passive nature of coupling, the proposed coupling scheme can open avenues for designing pattern recognition and neuromorphic computation systems using chemical reactions in a spontaneous process.]]></summary>

We study the deterministic dynamics of [math] point particles moving at a constant speed in a 2D table made of two polygonal urns connected by an active rectangular channel, which applies a feedback control on the particles, inverting the horizontal component of their velocities when their number in the channel exceeds a fixed threshold. Such a bounce-back mechanism is non-dissipative: it preserves volumes in phase space. An additional passive channel closes the billiard table forming a circuit in which a stationary current may flow. Under specific constraints on the geometry and on the initial conditions, the large [math] limit allows nonequilibrium phase transitions between homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases. The role of ergodicity in making a probabilistic theory applicable is discussed for both rational and irrational urns. The theoretical predictions are compared with the numerical simulation results. Connections with the dynamics of feedback-controlled biological systems are highlighted.]]></summary>

In many real-world interdependent network systems, nodes often work together to form groups, which can enhance robustness to resist risks. However, previous group percolation models are always of a first-order phase transition, regardless of the group size distribution. This motivates us to investigate a generalized model for group percolation in interdependent networks with a reinforcement network layer to eliminate collapse. Some backup devices that are equipped for a density [math] of reinforced nodes constitute the reinforcement network layer. For each group, we assume that at least one node of the group can function in one network and a node in another network depends on the group to function. We find that increasing the density [math] of reinforcement nodes and the size [math] of the dependency group can significantly enhance the robustness of interdependent networks. Importantly, we find the existence of a hybrid phase transition behavior and propose a method for calculating the shift point of percolation types. The most interesting finding is the exact universal solution to the minimal density [math] of reinforced nodes (or the minimum group size [math]) to prevent abrupt collapse for Erdős–Rényi, scale-free, and regular random interdependent networks. Furthermore, we present the validity of the analytic solutions for a triple point [math] (or [math]), the corresponding phase transition point [math], and second-order phase transition points [math] in interdependent networks. These findings might yield a broad perspective for designing more resilient interdependent infrastructure networks.]]></summary>

We investigate the localization of invariant spanning curves for a family of two-dimensional area-preserving mappings described by the dynamical variables [math] and [math] by using Slater’s criterion. The Slater theorem says there are three different return times for an irrational translation over a circle in a given interval. The returning time, which measures the number of iterations a map needs to return to a given periodic or quasi periodic region, has three responses along an invariant spanning curve. They are related to a continued fraction expansion used in the translation and obey the Fibonacci sequence. The rotation numbers for such curves are related to a noble number, leading to a devil’s staircase structure. The behavior of the rotation number as a function of invariant spanning curves located by Slater’s criterion resulted in an expression of a power law in which the absolute value of the exponent is equal to the control parameter [math] that controls the speed of the divergence of [math] in the limit the action [math] is sufficiently small.]]></summary>

Synthetic circuits that can record in vivo signaling networks have been critical in elucidating animal development. Here, we report on the transfer of this technology to plants using orthogonal serine integrases to mediate site-specific and irreversible DNA recombination visualized by switching between fluorescent reporters. When combined with promoters expressed during lateral root initiation, integrases amplified reporter signal and permanently marked all descendants. In addition, we have developed a suite of methods to tune the threshold for integrase switching, including: RNA/protein degradation tags, a nuclear localization signal, and a split-intein system. These tools improved the robustness of integrase-mediated switching with different promoters and the stability of switching behavior over multiple generations. This integrase toolbox can be used to build history-dependent circuits to decode the order of expression during organogenesis in many contexts.]]></summary>

However, there is a mismatch between its impressive development and the standardization required to promote interoperability between the different systems available. The full development of the field is thus hampered by a surge of oftentimes incompatible organism-specific systems. To overcome these issues, we present Golden Standard (GS), a Type IIS assembly method underpinned by the Standard European Vector Architecture (SEVA). GS unlocks modular cloning applications for most bacteria, and delivers consistent combinatorial multi-part assembly of standardized genetic elements to create genetic circuits of up to twenty transcription units. Reliance on the Modular Cloning (MoClo) syntax renders GS fully compatible with many existing tools and it sets the path towards efficient reusability of available part libraries and assembled TUs. GS was fully validated in terms of DNA assembly performance, portability and phenotype engineering in model and non-model bacteria. In order to facilitate the widespread adoption and future community-driven development of GS, we provide a web-portal featuring: i) a repository of parts and vectors, ii) Wizard and Setup tools to guide the design of constructs using stored and user-specific parts.]]></summary>

Supply-chain systems (SCSs) are an indispensable part of our daily infrastructures. Note that a small perturbation in a SCS can be amplified, eliciting cascading failures. It is of significant value to ensure a high resilience of SCSs. However, due to the complexity of SCSs, it is quite challenging to study their resilience under conditions of perturbations. In view of this, this paper presents a complex network perspective toward the resilience of SCSs. To achieve this goal, a complex SCS is modeled as a multilayer supply-chain network (SCN) with physical organizations being modeled as nodes and interactions among them as edges. A modeled SCN contains three types of nodes, i.e., suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers. An algorithm is proposed to construct a multilayer SCN. For each layer of a multilayer SCN, two kinds of networks, i.e., networks with Poisson degree distributions and networks with power-law degree distributions, are considered. For a given multilayer SCN, a ripple-effect network model is proposed to analyze its resilience under perturbations. Regarding the perturbations, two scenarios, i.e., random node failures and target node failures, are adopted in this research. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed network perspective, simulations on computer-generated SCNs are carried out. Interestingly, it is found that the resilience of SCNs under both random and target perturbations presents a discontinuous phase-change phenomenon, which indicates that SCNs are quite fragile under perturbations. It is further noticed that SCNs with power-law degree distributions are relatively more robust than SCNs with Poisson degree distributions. Although SCNs are found to be fragile, it has been discovered that denser interactions between different system organizations can enhance the network’s resilience.]]></summary>

It is shown that for growth velocities [math] and [math], where [math] and [math] are the mean domain size of the metastable phase (M-phase) and the mean nucleation time, respectively, the M-phase decays following a power law. Furthermore, snapshots at different time [math] that are taken to collect data for the distribution function [math] of the domain size [math] of the M-phase are found to obey dynamic scaling. Using the idea of data-collapse, we show that each snapshot is a self-similar fractal. However, for [math], such as in the classical Kolmogorov–Johnson–Mehl–Avrami model, and for [math], the decays of the M-phase are exponential and they are not accompanied by dynamic scaling. We find a perfect agreement between numerical simulation and analytical results.]]></summary>

Consider [math] identical Kuramoto oscillators on a random graph. Specifically, consider Erdős–Rényi random graphs in which any two oscillators are bidirectionally coupled with unit strength, independently and at random, with probability [math]. We say that a network is globally synchronizing if the oscillators converge to the all-in-phase synchronous state for almost all initial conditions. Is there a critical threshold for [math] above which global synchrony is extremely likely but below which it is extremely rare? It is suspected that a critical threshold exists and is close to the so-called connectivity threshold, namely, [math] for [math]. Ling, Xu, and Bandeira made the first progress toward proving a result in this direction: they showed that if [math], then Erdős–Rényi networks of Kuramoto oscillators are globally synchronizing with high probability as [math]. Here, we improve that result by showing that [math] suffices. Our estimates are explicit: for example, we can say that there is more than a [math] chance that a random network with [math] and [math] is globally synchronizing.]]></summary>

We disclose a new class of patterns, called patched patterns, in arrays of non-locally coupled excitable units with attractive and repulsive interactions. The self-organization process involves the formation of two types of patches, majority and minority ones, characterized by uniform average spiking frequencies. Patched patterns may be temporally periodic, quasiperiodic, or chaotic, whereby chaotic patterns may further develop interfaces comprised of units with average frequencies in between those of majority and minority patches. Using chaos and bifurcation theory, we demonstrate that chaos typically emerges via a torus breakup and identify the secondary bifurcation that gives rise to chaotic interfaces. It is shown that the maximal Lyapunov exponent of chaotic patched patterns does not decay, but rather converges to a finite value with system size. Patched patterns with a smaller wavenumber may exhibit diffusive motion of chaotic interfaces, similar to that of the incoherent part of chimeras.]]></summary>

An effective and stable operation of an economic system leads to a prosperous society and sustainable world development. Unfortunately, the system faces inevitable perturbations of extreme events and is frequently damaged. To maintain the system's stability, recovering its damaged functionality is essential and is complementary to strengthening its resilience and forecasting extreme events. This paper proposes a target recovery method based on network and economic equilibrium theories to defend the economic system against perturbations characterized as localized attacks. This novel method stimulates a set of economic sectors that mutually reinforce damaged economic sectors and is intuitively named the target reinforcement path (TRP) method. Developing a nonlinear dynamic model that simulates the economic system's operation after being perturbed by a localized attack and recovering based on a target recovery method, we compute the relaxation time for this process to quantify the method's efficiency. Furthermore, we adopt a rank aggregation method to comprehensively measure the method's efficiency by studying the target recovery of three country-level economic systems (China, India, and Japan) for 73 different regional attack scenarios. Through a comparative analysis of the TRP method and three other classic methods, the TRP method is shown to be more effective and less costly. Applicatively, the proposed method exhibits the potential to recover other vital complex systems with spontaneous recovery ability, such as immune, neurological, and ecological systems.]]></summary>

The system of two resources [math] and [math] and one consumer [math] is investigated within the Rosenzweig–MacArthur model with a Holling type II functional response. The rates of consumption of particular resources are normalized as to keep their sum constant. Dynamic switching is introduced as to increase the variable [math] in a process of finite speed. The space of parameters where both resources coexist is explored numerically. The results indicate that oscillations of [math] and mutually synchronized [math], which appear equal for the rates of consumption, are destabilized when these rates are modified. Then, the system is driven to one of fixed points or to a limit cycle with a much smaller amplitude.

In mobile communication systems, congestion is related to high-traffic events (HTEs) that occur in the coverage areas of base stations. Understanding, recognizing, and predicting these HTEs and researching their occurrence rules provides theoretical and decision-making support for preventing system congestion. Communication sectors are regarded as nodes, and if HTEs occur synchronously among sectors, then the corresponding nodes are connected. The total number of synchronous HTEs determines the edge weights. The mobile-communication spatiotemporal data are mapped to a weighted network, with the occurrence locations of HTEs as the basic elements. Network analysis provides a structure for representing the interaction of HTEs. By analyzing the topological features of the event synchronization network, the associations among the occurrence times of HTEs can be mined. We find that the event synchronization network is a small-world network, the cumulative strength distribution is exponential, and the edge weight obeys a power law. Moreover, the node clustering coefficient is negatively correlated with the node degree. A congestion coefficient based on several topological parameters is proposed, and the system congestion is visualized. The congestion coefficient contains information about the synchronous occurrence of HTEs between a sector and its neighbors and information about the synchronous occurrence of HTEs among its neighbors. For the mobile communication system considered in this study, the congestion coefficient of a large number of sectors is small and the risk of system congestion is low.]]></summary>

Shoot apical meristems (SAMs) give rise to all above-ground tissues of a plant. Expansion of meristematic tissue is derived from the growth and division of stem cells that reside in a central zone of the SAM. This reservoir of stem cells is maintained by expression of a transcription factor WUSCHEL that is responsible for the development of stem cells in the central zone. WUSCHEL expression is self-activating and downregulated by a signaling pathway initiated by CLAVATA proteins, which are upregulated by WUSCHEL. This classic activator–inhibitor network can generate localized patterns of WUSCHEL activity by a Turing instability provided certain constraints on reaction rates and diffusion constants of WUSCHEL and CLAVATA are satisfied, and most existing mathematical models of nucleation and confinement of stem cells in the SAM rely on Turing's mechanism. However, Turing patterns have certain properties that are inconsistent with observed patterns of stem cell differentiation in the SAM. As an alternative mechanism, we propose a model for stem cell confinement based on a bistable-switch in WUSCHEL–CLAVATA interactions. We study the bistable-switch mechanism for pattern formation in a spatially continuous domain and in a discrete cellularized tissue in the presence of a non-uniform field of a rapidly diffusing hormone. By comparing domain formation by Turing and bistable-switch mechanisms in these contexts, we show that bistable switching provides a superior account of nucleation and confinement of the stem cell domain under reasonable assumptions on reaction rates and diffusion constants.]]></summary>

Fractional Brownian motion, a Gaussian non-Markovian self-similar process with stationary long-correlated increments, has been identified to give rise to the anomalous diffusion behavior in a great variety of physical systems. The correlation and diffusion properties of this random motion are fully characterized by its index of self-similarity or the Hurst exponent. However, recent single-particle tracking experiments in biological cells revealed highly complicated anomalous diffusion phenomena that cannot be attributed to a class of self-similar random processes. Inspired by these observations, we here study the process that preserves the properties of the fractional Brownian motion at a single trajectory level; however, the Hurst index randomly changes from trajectory to trajectory. We provide a general mathematical framework for analytical, numerical, and statistical analysis of the fractional Brownian motion with the random Hurst exponent. The explicit formulas for probability density function, mean-squared displacement, and autocovariance function of the increments are presented for three generic distributions of the Hurst exponent, namely, two-point, uniform, and beta distributions. The important features of the process studied here are accelerating diffusion and persistence transition, which we demonstrate analytically and numerically.]]></summary>

In this paper, the impact of environmental noise on prey–predator interactions with seasonal fluctuations in water levels has been studied. Both intensity of noise and water level variations together play a significant role in the dynamics of an aquatic prey–predator system. Analytically, we have shown the existence of a positive solution and its uniqueness, the ultimate bound of the system’s solutions, and the global attractivity of the solution. Moreover, parametric conditions for which model species either persist (strongly or weakly) in the system or go into extinction are derived and their biological significance is also discussed. The sufficient condition of stochastic permanence is also analyzed. To justify the analytical results, we have performed numerical simulations of both deterministic and stochastic systems and observed some significant dynamics in the considered system.]]></summary>

The goal of this study is explicit demarcation of the region of validity of a linear canonical representation for chaotic advection of Lagrangian fluid parcels in “chaotic seas” in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) time-periodic fluid flows governed by Hamiltonian mechanics. The concept of lobe dynamics admits exact and unique geometric demarcation of this region and, inherently, distinction of the portions of chaotic seas with essentially linear vs nonlinear Lagrangian transport. This, furthermore, admits explicit establishment of a topological equivalence between the (embedded) Hamiltonian structure of the Lagrangian dynamics in 2D (3D) flows and their canonical form. The linear transport region in physical space encompasses four adjacent subregions that each corresponds to one of the four quadrants in canonical space and may exchange material with their environment in two essentially nonlinear ways. First, exchange between quadrants within the linear transport region and, second, exchange with the exterior of this region. Both forms of exchange can be linked to specific subsets of material elements defined by interacting lobes and combined give rise to circulation through the quadrants of the linear transport region that systematically exchanges the material with the exterior.]]></summary>

Recognizing surrounding situations, such as enemy attacks, which can be realized by predator–prey relationships, is one of the common behaviors of the population in ecosystems. In this paper, we explore the relationship between such species’ behavior and biodiversity in the spatial rock–paper–scissors game by employing the ecological concept “vigilance.” In order to describe the vigilance process, we adopt a multiplex structure where two distinct layers describe virtual and physical interactions. By investigating the process of evolution in species, we also found that species with different vigilance go together. In addition, by utilizing the dynamic time warping method, we found that species with the same vigilance have consistent behavior, but species with different vigilance have diverse behavior. Our findings may lead to broader interpretations of mechanisms promoting biodiversity via vigilance in species ecosystems.]]></summary>

We propose a simple method of constructing a system of differential equations of chaotic behavior based on the regression only from scalar observable time-series data. The estimated system enables us to reconstruct invariant sets and statistical properties as well as to infer short time-series. Our successful modeling relies on the introduction of a set of Gaussian radial basis functions to capture local structures. The proposed method is used to construct a system of ordinary differential equations whose orbit reconstructs a time-series of a variable of the well-known Lorenz system as a simple but typical example. A system for a macroscopic fluid variable is also constructed.]]></summary>

Ordinal patterns can be used to construct non-parametric hypothesis tests that aim to discover (possibly non-linear) serial dependence in a real-valued time series. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the vector of sample frequencies of ordinal patterns and that of various corresponding tests statistics such that the targeted tests for serial dependence are easily implemented based on asymptotic approximations. Simulations are used to check the finite-sample performance of these tests as well as their power properties with respect to various alternative scenarios. The application and interpretation of the tests in practice are illustrated by an environmental data example.]]></summary>

We study chaotic dynamics in a system of four differential equations describing the interaction of five identical phase oscillators coupled via biharmonic function. We show that this system exhibits strange spiral attractors (Shilnikov attractors) with two zero (indistinguishable from zero in numerics) Lyapunov exponents in a wide region of the parameter space. We explain this phenomenon by means of bifurcation analysis of a three-dimensional Poincaré map for the system under consideration. We show that chaotic dynamics develop here near a codimension three bifurcation, when a periodic orbit (fixed point of the Poincaré map) has the triplet of multipliers [math]. As it is known, the flow normal form for such bifurcation is the well-known three-dimensional Arneodó–Coullet–Spiegel–Tresser (ACST) system, which exhibits spiral attractors. According to this, we conclude that the additional zero Lyapunov exponent for orbits in the observed attractors appears due to the fact that the corresponding three-dimensional Poincaré map is very close to the time-shift map of the ACST-system.]]></summary>

Existing tools for bifurcation detection from signals of dynamical systems typically are either limited to a special class of systems or they require carefully chosen input parameters and a significant expertise to interpret the results. Therefore, we describe an alternative method based on persistent homology—a tool from topological data analysis—that utilizes Betti numbers and CROCKER plots. Betti numbers are topological invariants of topological spaces, while the CROCKER plot is a coarsened but easy to visualize data representation of a one-parameter varying family of persistence barcodes. The specific bifurcations we investigate are transitions from periodic to chaotic behavior or vice versa in a one-parameter collection of differential equations. We validate our methods using numerical experiments on ten dynamical systems and contrast the results with existing tools that use the maximum Lyapunov exponent. We further prove the relationship between the Wasserstein distance to the empty diagram and the norm of the Betti vector, which shows that an even more simplified version of the information has the potential to provide insight into the bifurcation parameter. The results show that our approach reveals more information about the shape of the periodic attractor than standard tools, and it has more favorable computational time in comparison with the Rösenstein algorithm for computing the maximum Lyapunov exponent.]]></summary>

An efficient emotion recognition model is an important research branch in electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain–computer interfaces. However, the input of the emotion recognition model is often a whole set of EEG channels obtained by electrodes placed on subjects. The unnecessary information produced by redundant channels affects the recognition rate and depletes computing resources, thereby hindering the practical applications of emotion recognition. In this work, we aim to optimize the input of EEG channels using a visibility graph (VG) and genetic algorithm-based convolutional neural network (GA-CNN). First, we design an experiment to evoke three types of emotion states using movies and collect the multi-channel EEG signals of each subject under different emotion states. Then, we construct VGs for each EEG channel and derive nonlinear features representing each EEG channel. We employ the genetic algorithm (GA) to find the optimal subset of EEG channels for emotion recognition and use the recognition results of the CNN as fitness values. The experimental results show that the recognition performance of the proposed method using a subset of EEG channels is superior to that of the CNN using all channels for each subject. Last, based on the subset of EEG channels searched by the GA-CNN, we perform cross-subject emotion recognition tasks employing leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in recognizing emotion states using fewer EEG channels and further enrich the methods of EEG classification using nonlinear features.]]></summary>

The symmetry breaking of solitons in the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with cubic–quintic competing nonlinearity and parity-time symmetric potential is studied. At first, a new asymmetric branch separates from the fundamental symmetric soliton at the first power critical point, and then, the asymmetric branch passes through the branch of the fundamental symmetric soliton and finally merges into the branch of the fundamental symmetric soliton at the second power critical point, while the power of the soliton increases. This leads to the symmetry breaking and double-loop bifurcation of fundamental symmetric solitons. From the power-propagation constant curves of solitons, symmetric fundamental and tripole solitons, asymmetric solitons can also exist. The stability of symmetric fundamental solitons, asymmetric solitons, and symmetric tripole solitons is discussed by the linear stability analysis and direct simulation. Results indicate that symmetric fundamental solitons and symmetric tripole solitons tend to be stable with the increase in the soliton power. Asymmetric solitons are unstable in both high and low power regions. Moreover, with the increase in saturable nonlinearity, the stability region of fundamental symmetric solitons and symmetric tripole solitons becomes wider.]]></summary>

The cubic nonlinear Helmholtz equation with third and fourth order dispersion and non-Kerr nonlinearity, such as the self steepening and the self frequency shift, is considered. This model describes nonparaxial ultrashort pulse propagation in an optical medium in the presence of spatial dispersion originating from the failure of slowly varying envelope approximation. We show that this system admits periodic (elliptic) solitary waves with a dipole structure within a period and also a transition from a dipole to quadrupole structure within a period depending on the value of the modulus parameter of a Jacobi elliptic function. The parametric conditions to be satisfied for the existence of these solutions are given. The effect of the nonparaxial parameter on physical quantities, such as amplitude, pulse width, and speed of the solitary waves, is examined. It is found that by adjusting the nonparaxial parameter, the speed of solitary waves can be decelerated. The stability and robustness of the solitary waves are discussed numerically.]]></summary>

Motion is a typical reaction among animals and humans trying to reach better conditions in a changing world. This aspect has been studied intensively in social dilemmas where competing players’ individual and collective interests are in conflict. Starting from the traditional public goods game model, where players are locally fixed and unconditional cooperators or defectors are present, we introduce two additional strategies through which agents can change their positions of dependence on the local cooperation level. More importantly, these so-called sophisticated players should bear an extra cost to maintain their permanent capacity to evaluate their neighborhood and react accordingly. Hence, four strategies compete, and the most successful one can be imitated by its neighbors. Crucially, the introduction of costly movement has a highly biased consequence on the competing main strategies. In the majority of parameter space, it is harmful to defectors and provides a significantly higher cooperation level when the population is rare. At an intermediate population density, which would be otherwise optimal for a system of immobile players, the presence of mobile actors could be detrimental if the interaction pattern changes slightly, thereby blocking the optimal percolation of information flow. In this parameter space, sophisticated cooperators can also show the co-called Moor effect by first avoiding the harmful vicinity of defectors; they subsequently transform into an immobile cooperator state. Hence, paradoxically, the additional cost of movement could be advantageous to reach a higher general income, especially for a rare population when subgroups would be isolated otherwise.]]></summary>

Despite their simplicity, networks of coupled phase oscillators can give rise to intriguing collective dynamical phenomena. However, the symmetries of globally and identically coupled identical units do not allow solutions where distinct oscillators are frequency-unlocked—a necessary condition for the emergence of chimeras. Thus, forced symmetry breaking is necessary to observe chimera-type solutions. Here, we consider the bifurcations that arise when full permutational symmetry is broken for the network to consist of coupled populations. We consider the smallest possible network composed of four phase oscillators and elucidate the phase space structure, (partial) integrability for some parameter values, and how the bifurcations away from full symmetry lead to frequency-unlocked weak chimera solutions. Since such solutions wind around a torus they must arise in a global bifurcation scenario. Moreover, periodic weak chimeras undergo a period-doubling cascade leading to chaos. The resulting chaotic dynamics with distinct frequencies do not rely on amplitude variation and arise in the smallest networks that support chaos.]]></summary>

Memristor-based neuromorphic systems have a neuro-bionic function, which is critical for possibly overcoming Moore's law limitation and the von Neumann bottleneck problem. To explore neural behaviors and complexity mechanisms in memristive circuits, this paper proposes an N-type locally active memristor, based on which a third-order memristive circuit is constructed. Theoretical analysis shows that the memristive circuit can exhibit not only various action potentials but also self-sustained oscillation and chaos. Based on Chua's theory of local activity, this paper finds that the neural behaviors and chaos emerge near the edge of chaos through subcritical Hopf bifurcation, in which the small unstable limit cycle is depicted by the dividing line between the attraction basin of the large stable limit cycle and the attraction basin of the stable equilibrium point. Furthermore, an analog circuit is designed to imitate the action potentials and chaos, and the simulation results are in agreement with the theoretical analysis.]]></summary>

Effective strategies of vaccine prioritization are essential to mitigate the impacts of severe infectious diseases. We investigate the role of infection fatality ratio (IFR) and social contact matrices on vaccination prioritization using a compartmental epidemic model fueled by real-world data of different diseases and countries. Our study confirms that massive and early vaccination is extremely effective to reduce the disease fatality if the contagion is mitigated, but the effectiveness is increasingly reduced as vaccination beginning delays in an uncontrolled epidemiological scenario. The optimal and least effective prioritization strategies depend non-linearly on epidemiological variables. Regions of the epidemiological parameter space, in which prioritizing the most vulnerable population is more effective than the most contagious individuals, depend strongly on the IFR age profile being, for example, substantially broader for COVID-19 in comparison with seasonal influenza. Demographics and social contact matrices deform the phase diagrams but do not alter their qualitative shapes.]]></summary>
