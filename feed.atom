Of paramount importance in both ecological systems and economic policies are the problems of harvesting of natural resources. A paradigmatic situation where this question is raised is that of fishing strategies. Indeed, overfishing is a well-known problem in the management of live-stocks, as being too greedy may lead to an overall dramatic depletion of the population we are harvesting. A closely related topic is that of Nash equilibria in the context of fishing policies. Namely, two players being in competition for the same pool of resources, is it possible for them to find an equilibrium situation? The goal of this paper is to provide a detailed analysis of these two queries (i.e optimal fishing strategies for single-player models and study of Nash equilibria for multiple players…]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study the solution landscape and bifurcation diagrams of nematic liquid crystals confined on a rectangle, using a reduced two-dimensional Landau–de Gennes framework in terms of two geometry-dependent variables: half short edge length [math] and aspect ratio [math]. First, we analytically prove that, for any [math] with a small enough [math] or for a large enough [math] with a fixed domain size, there is a unique stable solution that has two line defects on the opposite short edges. Second, we numerically construct solution landscapes by varying [math] and [math], and report a novel X state, which emerges from saddle-node bifurcation and serves as the parent state in such a solution landscape. Various new classes are then found among these solution landscapes, including the X class, the S class, and the L class. By tracking the Morse indices of individual solutions, we present bifurcation diagrams for nematic equilibria, thus illustrating the emergence mechanism of critical points and several effects of geometrical anisotropy on confined defect patterns.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We deal with bistable reaction-diffusion equations in a domain of a metric graph with two vertices, that is, a domain of multiple half-lines with two junctions connected by a line segment. We prove that there exist two types of standing waves: standing front waves and unimodal waves, if the line segment is long enough. We also numerically show the exact number of standing wave solutions for a cubic nonlinearity and for a piecewise linear case. The stability and instability of the standing wave solutions are also investigated. Standing waves play a role in blocking the front propagation.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Pattern formation arising from the reaction-diffusion epidemic model is a space-time depiction of the distribution and transmission of infectious diseases. Disease control can be achieved by controlling the associated pattern formations. For an SIR reaction-diffusion epidemic model, we review its Turing pattern formations with different transmission rates under the case of a constant recovery rate. To control pattern formations of the SIR epidemic model, we introduce a regulator as a control function of the recovery rate. For a perfect control strategy, it not only leads to a desired pattern formation, but also has a small support in space-time domains. In order to obtain such a control strategy, we propose a sparse optimal control problem governed by the SIR epidemic model. We study the existence of optimal solutions, derive the first order necessary optimality system, obtain the sparsity structure of the control function, and numerically solve the control problem. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectivity of our method.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In mathematical modeling, it is common to have an equation [math], where the exact form of [math] is not known. This article shows that there are large classes of [math] where almost all [math] share the same properties. The classes we investigate are vector spaces [math] of [math] functions [math] that satisfy the following condition: [math] has “almost constant rank" (ACR) if there is a constant integer [math] such that rank[math] for “almost every" [math] and almost every [math]. If the vector space [math] is finite dimensional, then “almost every" is with respect to the Lebesgue measure on [math], and otherwise, it means almost every in the sense of prevalence, as described herein. Most function spaces commonly used for modeling purposes are ACR. In particular, we show that if all of the functions in [math] are linear or polynomial or real analytic, or if [math] is the set of all functions in a “structured system", then [math] is ACR. For each [math] and [math], the solution set of [math] is SolSet[math]. A solution set of [math] is called robust if it persists despite small changes in [math] and [math]. The following two global results are proved for almost every [math] in an ACR vector space [math]: (1) Either the solution set SolSet[math] is robust for almost every [math], or none of the solution sets are robust. (2) The solution set SolSet[math] is a [math]-manifold of dimension [math]. In particular, [math] is the same for almost every [math].]]></summary>

Recent years have witnessed the development of a variety of molecular scaffolds that mimic such cytoskeletal filaments. Indeed, filaments that are programmable and compatible with biological systems may prove useful in studying or substituting such proteins. Here, we explore the use of ssRNA tiles to build and modify cytoskeletal-like filaments in vitro. We engineer a number of functionalities that are crucial to the function of natural cytoskeletal systems into the ssRNA tiles, including the abilities to assemble or disassemble filaments, to tune the filament stiffness, to induce membrane binding, and to attach binding proteins. The work paves the way for building dynamic cell-like cytoskeletal systems made out of rationally designed ssRNA tiles that can be transcribed in natural or synthetic cells.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sulfide-dependent THI4 thiazole synthases could potentially be used to replace plant cysteine-dependent suicide THI4s, whose high protein turnover rates make thiamin synthesis exceptionally energy-expensive. However, sulfide-dependent THI4s are anaerobic or microoxic enzymes and hence unadapted to the aerobic conditions in plants; they are also slow enzymes (kcat <1 h-1). To improve aerotolerance and activity, we applied continuous directed evolution under aerobic conditions in the yeast OrthoRep system to two sulfide-dependent bacterial THI4s. Six beneficial single mutations were identified, of which five lie in the active-site cleft predicted by structural modeling and two recapitulate features of naturally aerotolerant THI4s. That single mutations gave substantial improvements suggests that further advance under selection will be possible by stacking mutations. This proof-of-concept study established that the performance of sulfide-dependent THI4s in aerobic conditions is evolvable and, more generally, that yeast OrthoRep provides a plant-like bridge to adapt nonplant enzymes to work better in plants.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
To understand the mechanisms underlying species coexistence, ecologists often study invasion growth rates of theoretical and data-driven models. These growth rates correspond to average per-capita growth rates of one species with respect to an ergodic measure supporting other species. In the ecological literature, coexistence often is equated with the invasion growth rates being positive. Intuitively, positive invasion growth rates ensure that species recover from being rare. To provide a mathematically rigorous framework for this approach, we prove theorems that answer two questions: (i) When do the signs of the invasion growth rates determine coexistence? (ii) When signs are sufficient, which invasion growth rates need to be positive? We focus on deterministic models and equate …]]></summary>

This article aims to compare the long-term behavior of a spread model before and after a type in the model becomes frozen, namely, a type of which an individual only produces individuals of the same type. By means of substitution dynamical systems and matrix analysis, the first result of this work gives the spread rates of a 1-spread model with one frozen symbol. Later, in the work, this is shown to hold under more general settings, which include generalized frozen symbols and frozen symbols in [math]-spread models. Numerical experiments are provided as supporting evidence for the theory.]]></summary>

We study the synchronization of two coupled idealized economies. In the present work, we consider a recently developed economic system that shows a richness of dynamical behavior. By means of the Lyapunov exponents, we analyze that there is overly complex behavior in the transitions in the dynamics of an isolated economy, oscillating between chaotic attractors and limit cycles. Then, for two coupled economies, we analyze the synchronization states for the space of all control parameters as a function of the network coupling parameter. Interestingly, we have evidenced that there is a broad region of fully synchronized states and as we increase the coupling, some phenomena such as a smooth and intermittent loss in synchronization emerge. In the same way, we observe phase synchronization for one of the control parameters. Ultimately, in order to confirm this loss of synchronization, we inspect the stability of synchronized states through the master stability function method for some control parameters. Here, we corroborate what was previously observed, the unexpected vast range of control parameter values of instability corresponding to desynchronization.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Methods for creating seamless genome modifications are an essential part of the microbial genetic toolkit that allows for strain engineering through the recycling of selectable markers. Here, we report the development of a method, termed SLICER, which can be used to create seamless genome modifications in D. radiodurans. We used SLICER to sequentially target four putative restriction-modification (R-M) system genes, recycling the same selective and screening markers for each subsequent deletion. A fifth R-M gene was replaced by a selectable marker to create a final D. radiodurans strain with 5 of the 6 putative R-M systems deleted. While we observed no significant increase in transformation efficiency, SLICER is a promising method to obtain a fully restriction-minus strain and expand the synthetic biology applications of D. radiodurans including as an in vivo DNA assembly platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whole-cell biosensors are emerging as promising tools for monitoring environmental pollutants such as heavy metals. These sensors constitute a genetic circuit comprising a sensing module and an output module, such that a detectable signal is produced in the presence of the desired analyte. The MerR family of metal-responsive regulators offers great potential for the construction of metal sensing circuits, due to their high sensitivity, tight transcription control and large diversity in metal-specificity. However, the sensing diversity is broadest in Gram-negative systems, while chassis organisms are often selected from Gram-positive species, particularly sporulating bacilli. This can be problematic, because Gram-negative biological parts, such as promoters, are frequently observed to be non-functional in Gram-positive hosts. Herein, we combined construction of synthetic genetic circuits and chimeric MerR regulators, supported by structure-guided design, to generate metal-sensitive biosensor modules that are functional in the biotechnological work-horse species Bacillus subtilis. These chimeras consist of a constant Gram-positive derived DNA-binding domain fused to variable metal binding domains of Gram-negative origins. To improve the specificity of the whole-cell biosensor, we developed a modular  AND gate logic system based on the B. subtilis natively split {sigma}-factor, SigO-RsoA, designed to maximise future use for synthetic biology applications in B. subtilis. This work provides insights into the use of modular regulators, such as the MerR family, in the design of synthetic circuits for the detection of heavy metals, with potential wider applicability of the approach to other systems and genetic backgrounds.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The IS200/IS605 family are abundant insertion sequences associated with one of the most numerous genes in nature, tnpB. Sequence homologies suggest that transposon-borne TnpB may be an evolutionary precursor to CRISPR-Cas system effector proteins, and TnpB has been shown to function as a Cas-like programmable DNA endonuclease. However, the role of TnpB in transposition and its contributions to genome dynamics remain elusive. Using a suite of fluorescent reporters coupled to transposition, we show that TnpB increases IS608-transposon activity and prevents transposon loss from genomes. Analyzing our results through a mathematical model of transposon dynamics, we discuss the multifaceted roles TnpB may play in transposon regulation. The mutually beneficial transposon-TnpB interaction may explain the prevalence of tnpB, creating conditions for the proliferation and appropriation of TnpBs RNA-guided endonuclease activity for adaptive immunity.]]></summary>

So-called electromicrobial production could be of particular value in the efficient production of hydrocarbon blends for use in aviation. Because of exacting standards for fuel energy density and the costs of new aviation infrastructure, liquid hydrocarbon fuels will be necessary for the foreseeable future, precluding direct electrification. Production of hydrocarbons using electrically-powered microbes employing fatty acid synthesis-based production of alkanes could be an efficient means to produce drop-in replacement jet fuels using renewable energy. Here, we calculate the upper limit electrical-to-energy conversion efficiency for a model jet fuel blend containing 85% straight-chain alkanes and 15% terpenoids. When using the Calvin cycle for carbon-fixation, the energy conversion efficiency is [Formula] when using extracellular electron uptake for electron delivery and [Formula] when using H2-oxidation. The efficiency of production of the jet fuel blend can be raised to [Formula] when using the Formolase formate-assimilation pathway and H2-oxidation, and to [Formula] with the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. The production efficiency can be further raised by swapping the well-known ADO pathway for alkane termination with for the recently discovered MCH pathway. If these systems were were supplied with electricity with a maximally-efficient silicon solar photovoltaic, even the least efficient would exceed the maximum efficiency of all known forms of photosynthesis.]]></summary>

Absolute Concentration Robustness (ACR) was introduced by Shinar and Feinberg (Science 327:1389-1391, 2010) as robustness of equilibrium species concentration in a mass action dynamical system. Their aim was to devise a mathematical condition that will ensure robustness in the function of the biological system being modeled. The robustness of function rests on what we refer to as empirical robustness—the concentration of a species remains unvarying, when measured in the long run, across arbitrary initial conditions. Even simple examples show that the ACR notion introduced in Shinar and Feinberg (Science 327:1389-1391, 2010) (here referred to as static ACR) is neither necessary nor sufficient for empirical robustness. To make a stronger connection with empirical robustness, we define dynamic ACR, a property related to long-term, global dynamics, rather than only to equilibrium behavior. We discuss general dynamical systems with dynamic ACR properties as well as parametrized families of dynamical systems related to reaction networks. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for dynamic ACR in complex balanced reaction networks, a class of networks that is central to the theory of reaction networks.]]></summary>

 Abstract. A matrix basis formulation is introduced to represent the [math] frequency domain dyadic Green’s functions of Maxwell’s equations in 3-dimensional layered media. The formulation can be used to decompose the Maxwell’s Green’s functions into independent TE and TM components, each satisfying a scalar Helmholtz equation. Moreover, the interface transmission conditions for the electromagnetic fields can be reduced to decoupled conditions for the matrix basis coefficients at interfaces. Numerical results for the electric and magnetic dyadic Green’s functions for a 10-layer medium show the capability of the proposed formulation.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, we formulate susceptible-infected-susceptible reaction-diffusion epidemic models with cognition and show the impact of movement strategies on disease outbreak and mitigation under a spatially heterogeneous environment. The cognitive diffusion either takes a Fokker–Planck type diffusion obtained by Chapman’s diffusion law (called random diffusion) or follows Fick’s diffusion law (called symmetric diffusion). We derive a variational expression of the basic reproduction number [math] for both models and prove that the disease-free equilibrium is unique and globally asymptotically stable if [math]. Furthermore, if [math], the model following Fick’s diffusion law admits at least one endemic equilibrium and the model following Chapman’s diffusion law has a unique endemic equilibrium. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations, which additionally show the segregation phenomenon between susceptible and infected populations regulated by different movement strategies. Spatial segregation here is natural, not caused by an isolation policy, and thus is the most important indicator for an infectious disease to spread or wane in the absence of intervention. The first example shows that a heterogeneous random diffusion segregates infected and susceptible populations further than an ODE model and thus reduces the infection size. However, symmetric diffusion never does that. The second example shows that a heterogeneous random diffusion detriments segregation but still reduces the infection severity by moving infected individuals to a disease-free region. In a certain situation, a heterogeneous random diffusion may increase the infection severity as shown in the last example.]]></summary>

We report on collective excitable events in a highly diluted random network of non-excitable nodes. Excitability arises thanks to a self-sustained local adaptation mechanism that drives the system on a slow timescale across a hysteretic phase transition involving states with different degrees of synchronization. These phenomena have been investigated for the Kuramoto model with bimodal distribution of the natural frequencies and for the Kuramoto model with inertia and a unimodal frequency distribution. We consider global and partial stimulation protocols and characterize the system response for different levels of dilution. We compare the results with those obtained in the fully coupled case showing that such collective phenomena are remarkably robust against network diluteness.]]></summary>

By applying a virial-like expansion, we provided a tighter lower limit solely in terms of the drift velocity and diffusion. The approach presented is systematically analyzed in the tight-binding regime. We also provide a relative simple rule to validate using the tight-binding approach based on drift and diffusion relations rather than energy barriers and forces.

The interaction between the swarm individuals affects the dynamic behavior of the swarm, but it is difficult to obtain directly from outside observation. Therefore, the problem we focus on is inferring the structure of the interactions in the swarm from the individual behavior trajectories. Similar inference problems that existed in network science are named network reconstruction or network inference. It is a fundamental problem pervading research on complex systems. In this paper, a new method, called Motion Trajectory Similarity, is developed for inferring direct interactions from the motion state of individuals in the swarm. It constructs correlations by combining the similarity of the motion trajectories of each cross section of the time series, in which individuals with highly similar motion states are more likely to interact with each other. Experiments on the flocking systems demonstrate that our method can produce a reliable interaction inference and outperform traditional network inference methods. It can withstand a high level of noise and time delay introduced into flocking models, as well as parameter variation in the flocking system, to achieve robust reconstruction. The proposed method provides a new perspective for inferring the interaction structure of a swarm, which helps us to explore the mechanisms of collective movement in swarms and paves the way for developing the flocking models that can be quantified and predicted.]]></summary>

Synchronous collisions between a large number of solitons are considered in the context of a statistical description. It is shown that, during the interaction of solitons of the same signs, the wave field is effectively smoothed out. When the number of solitons increases and the sequence of their amplitudes decay slower, the focused wave becomes even smoother and the statistical moments get frozen for a long time. This quasi-stationary state is characterized by greatly reduced statistical moments and by the density of solitons close to some critical value. This state may be treated as the small-dispersion limit, what makes it possible to analytically estimate all high-order statistical moments. While the focus of the study is made on the Korteweg–de Vries equation and its modified version, a much broader applicability of the results to equations that support soliton-type solutions is discussed.]]></summary>

In 1911, Jüttner proposed the generalization, for a relativistic gas, of the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of velocities. Here, we want to discuss, among others, the Jüttner probability density function (PDF). Both the velocity space and, consequently, the momentum space are not flat in special relativity. The velocity space corresponds to the Lobachevsky one, which has a negative curvature. This curvature induces a specific power for the Lorentz factor in the PDF, affecting the Jüttner normalization constant in one, two, and three dimensions. Furthermore, Jüttner distribution, written in terms of a more convenient variable, the rapidity, presents a curvature change at the origin at sufficiently high energy, which does not agree with our computational dynamics simulations of a relativistic gas. However, in one dimension, the rapidity satisfies a simple additivity law. This allows us to obtain, through the central limit theorem, a new, Lorentz-invariant, PDF whose curvature at the origin does not change for any energy value and which agrees with our computational dynamics simulations data. Also, we perform extensive first-principle simulations of a one-dimensional relativistic gas constituted by light and heavy particles.]]></summary>

A complex network has been widely used to reveal the rule of a complex system. How to convert the stock data into a network is an open issue since the stock data are so large and their random volatility is strong. In this paper, a seasonal trend decomposition procedure based on the loess ([math]) method is applied to convert the stock time series into a directed and weighted symbolic network. Three empirical stock datasets, including the closing price of Shanghai Securities Composite Index, S&P 500 Index, and Nikkei 225 Index, are considered. The properties of these stock time series are revealed from the topological characteristics of corresponding symbolic networks. The results show that: (1) both the weighted indegree and outdegree distributions obey the power-law distribution well; (2) fluctuations of stock closing price are revealed by related network topological properties, such as weighting degree, betweenness, pageranks, and clustering coefficient; and (3) stock closing price, in particular, periods such as financial crises, can be identified by modularity class of the symbolic networks. Moreover, the comparison between the [math] method and the visibility graph further highlights the advantages of the [math] method in terms of the time complexity of the algorithm. Our method offers a new idea to study the network conversion of stock time series.]]></summary>

Although cellular life may have emerged spontaneously, programmable integration of building blocks into size, membrane property-controlled compartments (liposome or coacervate) towards cellular organization, without using specialized devices, has proven difficult. Here, we report a self-templated route to monodisperse complex droplets in bulk solution from coacervate-liposome synergy, with nanoliposome controlling coacervate size and coacervate templating on-surface nanoliposome fusion. Nanoliposome-coated monodisperse coacervates are self-assembled within 30 seconds, which are sealed by fusing nanoliposomes into size-controlled giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), with model building blocks combinatorially integrated into droplets. Defect-free membrane is established on coacervate, which render these complex GUVs surviving at extreme osmotic, salty and pH conditions (4 M NaCl, 100 mM HCl, 1 M NaOH), while providing homeostasis for enzymatic reactions, reminiscent of extremophiles.]]></summary>

The Cannabinoid receptors type 1 and 2 (CB1/2R) are of particular interest, given the cornucopia of natural and synthetic cannabinoids being explored as therapeutics. We show for the first time that engineering the N-terminus of CB1R allows for efficient signal transduction in yeast, and that engineering the sterol composition of the yeast membrane optimizes CB2R performance. Using the dual cannabinoid biosensors, large libraries of synthetic cannabinoids and terpenes could be quickly screened to elucidate known and novel structure-activity relationships, including compounds and trends that more selectively target each of the two receptors. The biosensor strains offer a ready platform for evaluating the activity of new synthetic cannabinoids, monitoring drugs of abuse, and developing molecules that target the therapeutically important CB2R receptor while minimizing psychoactive effects.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
How to determine the spatial distribution and population dynamics of animals are some of the key questions in ecology. These two have been coupled before, but there is no general method for determining spatial distributions based on instantanous behavior coupled with population dynamics. We propose modeling interacting populations with instantaneous habitat choice through mean-field games. By using the framework of variational inequalities, we are able to determine existence and uniqueness for habitat distributions of interacting populations, in both continuous and discrete habitats. With some additional restrictions, we are also able to show existence and uniqueness of fixed-points of the population dynamics along with spatial distributions. We illustrate our theoretical results by studying a Rosenzweig–MacArthur model where predators and consumers inhabit a continuous habitat. This study is conducted both theoretically and numerically. Analyzing the emergent dynamics is possible as viewing the system from the vantage point of variational inequalities allows for applying efficient numerical methods. The generality of our theoretical approach opens up for studying complex ecosystems, e.g. the impact of enrichment on spatial distributions in marine ecosystems.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSTo support the increasingly complex circuits needed for plant synthetic biology applications, additional constitutive promoters are essential. Reusing promoter parts can lead to difficulty in cloning, increased heterogeneity between transformants, transgene silencing and trait instability. Moreover, the utility of such promoters could be increased by introducing target sequences not found elsewhere in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome and well-suited for Cas9-associated guide RNAs (gRNAs).

MethodsWe have developed a pipeline to identify genes that have stable expression across a wide range of Arabidopsis tissues at different developmental stages, and have identified a number of promoters that are well expressed in both transient (Nicotiana benthamiana) and stable (Arabidopsis) transformation assays. We have also introduced two genome-orthogonal gRNA target-sites in a subset of the screened promoters, converting them into NOR logic gates.

ResultsOf twenty-two promoters identified in our bioinformatic screen, sixteen drove detectable reporter expression in N. benthamiana. Only three of these promoters were able to produce visible expression of the RUBY reporter in Arabidopsis despite producing RUBY mRNA that could be readily detected by qPCR. We then modified six of these promoters to be repressible, and five of which functioned as NOR gates

ConclusionsOne of the major bottlenecks for the ambitious engineering projects currently under development in plants is the lack of well-characterized constitutive promoters. The work here begins to fill this gap. It can also form the basis of constructing more complex information processing circuits in the future.]]></summary>

External beam radiation therapy is a key part of modern cancer treatments which uses high doses of radiation to destroy tumour cells. Despite its widespread usage and extensive study in theoretical, experimental, and clinical works, many questions still remain about how best to administer it. Many mathematical studies have examined optimal scheduling of radiotherapy, and most come to similar conclusions. Importantly though, these studies generally assume intratumoral homogeneity. But in recent years, it has become clear that tumours are not homogeneous masses of cancerous cells, but wildly heterogeneous masses with various subpopulations which grow and respond to treatment differently. One subpopulation of particular importance is cancer stem cells (CSCs) which are known to exhibi…]]></summary>

Vegetation patterns with a variety of structures is amazing phenomena in arid or semi-arid areas, which can identify the evolution law of vegetation and are typical signals of ecosystem functions. Many achievements have been made in this respect, yet the mechanisms of uptake–diffusion feedback on the pattern structures of vegetation is not fully understood. To well reveal the influences of parameters perturbation on the pattern formation of vegetation, we give a comprehensive analysis on a vegetation–water model in the forms of reaction–diffusion equation which is posed by Zelnik et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci 112:12,327–12,331, 2015). We obtain the exact parameters range for stationary patterns and show the dynamical behaviors near the bifurcation point based on nonlinear analysis. It is found that the model has the properties of spot, labyrinth and gap patterns. Moreover, water diffusion rate prohibits the growth of vegetation while shading parameter promotes the increase of vegetation biomass. Our results show that gradual transitions from uniform state to gap pattern can occur for suitable value of parameters which may induce the emergence of desertification.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We investigate the transfer function emanating from the linearization of a car-following model for human drivers when taking into account their reaction time, which is known to be a cause of the stop-and-go traffic phenomenon. This leads to a nonrational transfer function, implying nontrivial stability conditions which are explicitly given. They are in particular satisfied whenever string stability holds. We also show how this reaction time can introduce a partial string stability, where the transfer function modulus remains smaller than 1 up to some critical frequency. We explore conditions in the parameter space discriminating between 3 different regimes (stability, string stability, and partial string stability).]]></summary>

To study disease transmission with vaccination based on the network, we map an SIR model to a site-bond percolation model. In the case where the vaccination probability is zero, this model degenerates into a bond percolation model without the immunization. Using the method of generation functions, we obtain exact theoretical results for the epidemic threshold and the average outbreak size. From these exact solutions, we find that the epidemic threshold increases while the average outbreak size decreases with vaccination probability. Numerical simulations show that the size of giant component S increases with transmissibility T but decreases with the probability of vaccination. In addition, we compare the epidemic threshold and the size of the giant component for a Poisson network, an exponential network and a power-law network using numerical simulations. When the probability of vaccination is fixed, the epidemic threshold is the smallest for heterogeneous networks and the size of giant component S in homogeneous networks becomes largest for large transmissibility T(T close to 1).]]></summary>

To speed-up the solution of parametrized differential problems, reduced order models (ROMs) have been developed over the years, including projection-based ROMs such as the reduced-basis (RB) method, deep learning-based ROMs, as well as surrogate models obtained through machine learning techniques. Thanks to its physics-based structure, ensured by the use of a Galerkin projection of the full order model (FOM) onto a linear low-dimensional subspace, the Galerkin-RB method yields approximations that fulfill the differential problem at hand. However, to make the assembling of the ROM independent of the FOM dimension, intrusive and expensive hyper-reduction techniques, such as the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), are usually required, thus making this strategy less feasible for problems characterized by (high-order polynomial or nonpolynomial) nonlinearities. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a novel strategy for learning nonlinear ROM operators using deep neural networks (DNNs). The resulting hyper-reduced order model enhanced by DNNs, to which we refer to as Deep-HyROMnet, is then a physics-based model, still relying on the RB method approach, however employing a DNN architecture to approximate reduced residual vectors and Jacobian matrices once a Galerkin projection has been performed. Numerical results dealing with fast simulations in nonlinear structural mechanics show that Deep-HyROMnets are orders of magnitude faster than POD-Galerkin-DEIM ROMs, still ensuring the same level of accuracy.]]></summary>

Nonsmooth systems are widely encountered in engineering fields. They have abundant dynamical phenomena, including some results on the complex dynamics in such systems under quasiperiodically forced excitations. In this work, we consider a quasiperiodically forced piecewise linear oscillator and show that strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) do exist in such nonsmooth systems. The generation and evolution mechanisms of SNAs are discussed. The torus-doubling, fractal, bubbling, and intermittency routes to SNAs are identified. The strange properties of SNAs are characterized with the aid of the phase sensitivity function, singular continuous spectrum, rational frequency approximation, and the path of the partial Fourier sum of state variables in a complex plane. The nonchaotic properties of SNAs are verified by the methods of maximum Lyapunov exponent and power spectrum.]]></summary>

Individuals can make choices for themselves that are beneficial or detrimental to the entire group. Consider two losing choices that some individuals have to make on behalf of the group. Is it possible that the losing choices combine to give a winning outcome? We show that it is possible through a variant of Parrondo’s paradox—the preference aggregation Parrondo’s paradox (PAPP). This new variant of Parrondo’s paradox makes use of an aggregate rule that combines with a decision-making heuristic that can be applied to individuals or parts of the social group. The aim of this work is to discuss this PAPP framework and exemplify it on a social network. This work enhances existing research by constructing a feedback loop that allows individuals in the social network to adapt its behavior according to the outcome of the Parrondo’s games played.]]></summary>

In this paper, we study a posteriori error estimates of the IMEX BDF2 scheme for time discretizations of solving parabolic partial integro-differential equations, which describe the jump-diffusion option pricing model in finance. Because of the initial singularities of the solution which is due to the nonsmoothness of the payoff function, a posteriori error control and adaptivity will be crucial in solving numerically this type of equations. To derive optimal order a posteriori error estimates, quadratic reconstructions for the IMEX BDF2 method are introduced. By using these continuous, piecewise time reconstructions, the upper and lower error bounds depending only on the discretization parameters and the data of the problems are derived. Based on these a posteriori error estimates, we further develop a time adaptive algorithm. The numerical implementations are performed with both nonuniform partitions and adaptivity in time. The adaptive algorithm reduce the computational cost substantially and provides efficient error control for the solution.]]></summary>

In this work we propose a new family of high order accurate semi-discrete discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes for the thermodynamically compatible discretization of overdetermined first order hyperbolic systems. In particular, we consider a first order hyperbolic model of turbulent shallow water flows, as well as the unified first order hyperbolic Godunov–Peshkov–Romenski (GPR) model of continuum mechanics, which is able to describe at the same time viscous fluids and nonlinear elastic solids at large deformations. Both PDE systems treated in this paper belong to the class of hyperbolic and thermodynamically compatible systems, since both satisfy an entropy inequality and the total energy conservation can be obtained as a direct consequence of all other governing equations via suitable linear combination with the corresponding thermodynamic dual variables. In this paper, we mimic this process for the first time also at the semi-discrete level at the aid of high order discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes. For the GPR model we directly discretize the entropy inequality and obtain total energy conservation as a consequence of a suitable discretization of all other evolution equations. For turbulent shallow water flows we directly discretize the nonconservative evolution equations related to the Reynolds stress tensor and obtain total energy conservation again as a result of the thermodynamically compatible discretization. As a consequence, for continuum mechanics the new DG schemes satisfy a cell entropy inequality directly by construction and thanks to the discrete thermodynamic compatibility they are provably nonlinearly stable in the energy norm for both systems under consideration.]]></summary>

The complexity of biological systems, and the increasingly large amount of associated experimental data, necessitates that we develop mathematical models to further our understanding of these systems. Because biological systems are generally not well understood, most mathematical models of these systems are based on experimental data, resulting in a seemingly heterogeneous collection of models that ostensibly represent the same system. To understand the system we therefore need to understand how the different models are related to each other, with a view to obtaining a unified mathematical description. This goal is complicated by the fact that a number of distinct mathematical formalisms may be employed to represent the same system, making direct comparison of the models very diff…]]></summary>

In this paper, we focus on the mathematical foundations of reduced order model (ROM) closures. First, we extend the verifiability concept from large eddy simulation to the ROM setting. Specifically, we call a ROM closure model verifiable if a small ROM closure model error (i.e., a small difference between the true ROM closure and the modeled ROM closure) implies a small ROM error. Second, we prove that the data-driven ROM closure studied here (i.e., the data-driven variational multiscale ROM) is verifiable. Finally, we investigate the verifiability of the data-driven variational multiscale ROM in the numerical simulation of the one-dimensional Burgers equation and a two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers

Formation of synchronous activity patterns is an essential property of neuronal networks that has been of central interest to synchronization theory. Chimera states, where both synchronous and asynchronous activities of neurons co-exist in a single network, are particularly poignant examples of such patterns, whose dynamics and multistability may underlie brain function, such as cognitive tasks. However, dynamical mechanisms of coherent state formation in spiking neuronal networks as well as ways to control these states remain unclear. In this paper, we take a step in this direction by considering the evolution of chimera states in a network of class II excitable Morris–Lecar neurons with asymmetrical nonlocal inhibitory connections. Using the adaptive coherence measure, we are able to partition the network parameter space into regions of various collective behaviors (antiphase synchronous clusters, traveling waves, different types of chimera states as well as a spiking death regime) and have shown multistability between the various regimes. We track the evolution of the chimera states as a function of changed key network parameters and found transitions between various types of chimera states. We further find that the network can demonstrate long transients leading to quasi-persistence of activity patterns in the border regions hinting at near-criticality behaviors.]]></summary>

Cancer cells at the tumor boundary move in the direction of the oxygen gradient, while cancer cells far within the tumor are in a necrotic state. This paper introduces a simple mathematical model that accounts for these facts. The model consists of cancer cells, cytotoxic T cells, and oxygen satisfying a system of partial differential equations. Some of the model parameters represent the effect of anti-cancer drugs. The tumor boundary is a free boundary whose dynamics is determined by the movement of cancer cells at the boundary. The model is simulated for radially symmetric and axially symmetric tumors, and it is shown that the tumor may increase or decrease in size, depending on the “strength" of the drugs. Existence theorems are proved, global in-time in the radially symmetric case, and local in-time for any shape of tumor. In the radially symmetric case, it is proved, under different conditions, that the tumor may shrink monotonically, or expand monotonically.]]></summary>

In this paper, we investigate the maximization of the total population of a single species which is governed by a stationary diffusive logistic equation with a fixed amount of resources. For large diffusivity, qualitative properties of the maximizers like symmetry will be addressed. Our results are in line with previous findings which assert that for large diffusion, concentrated resources are favorable for maximizing the total population. Then, an optimality condition for the maximizer is derived based upon rearrangement theory. We develop an efficient numerical algorithm applicable to domains with different geometries in order to compute the maximizer. It is established that the algorithm is convergent. Our numerical simulations give a real insight into the qualitative properties of the maximizer and also lead us to some conjectures about the maximizer.]]></summary>

We propose a novel stochastic Nesterov’s smoothing accelerated method for general nonsmooth, constrained, stochastic composite convex optimization, the nonsmooth component of which may be not easy to compute its proximal operator. The proposed method combines Nesterov’s smoothing accelerated method (Nesterov in Math Program 103(1):127–152, 2005) for deterministic problems and stochastic approximation for stochastic problems, which allows three variants: single sample and two different mini-batch sizes per iteration, respectively. We prove that all the three variants achieve the best-known complexity bounds in terms of stochastic oracle. Numerical results on a robust linear regression problem, as well as a support vector machine problem show that the proposed method compares favorably with other state-of-the-art first-order methods, and the variants with mini-batch sizes outperform the variant with single sample.]]></summary>

This paper aims at developing a dissipation-preserving, linearized, and time-stepping-varying spectral method for strongly damped nonlinear wave system in multidimensional unbounded domains

                     (d=1, 2, and 3), where the nonlocal nature is described by the mixed fractional Laplacians. Because the underlying solutions of the problem involving mixed fractional Laplacians decay slowly with certain power law at infinity, we employ the rational spectral-Galerkin method using rational basis (or mapped Gegenbauer functions) for the spatial approximation. To capture the intrinsic dissipative properties of the model equations, we combine the Crank-Nicolson scheme with exponential scalar auxiliary variable approach for the temporal discretization. Based on the rate of nonlocal energy dissipation, we design a novel time-stepping-varying strategy to enhance the efficiency of the scheme. We present the detailed implementation of the scheme, where the main building block of the stiffness matrices is based on the Laguerre-Gauss quadrature rule for the modified Bessel functions of the second kind. The existence, uniqueness, and nonlocal energy dissipation law of the fully discrete scheme are rigourously established. Numerical examples in 3D case are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the scheme. Finally, we simulate the nonlinear behaviors of 2D/3D dissipative vector solitary waves for damped sine-Gordon system I, for damped sine-Gordon system II, and for damped Klein–Gordon system to provide a deeper understanding of nonlocal physics.]]></summary>

Individual behaviors and social relations influence each other. However, understanding the underlying mechanism remains challenging. From social norms controlling human behavior to individual management of interpersonal relationships, rewards and punishments are some of the most commonly used measures. Through simulating the weak prisoner’s dilemma in finite populations, we find that neither a simple reward measure nor a pure punishment mechanism can extensively promote cooperation. Instead, a combination of appropriate punishment and reward mechanisms can promote cooperation’s prosperity regardless of how large or small the temptation to defect is. In addition, the combination spontaneously produces inhomogeneities in social relations and individual influence, which support the continued existence of cooperative behavior. Finally, we further explain how cooperators establish a sustainable existence under the combination by investigating the social relations at different moments in a small system. These results demonstrate that dispensing rewards and punishments impartially in society is essential to social harmony.]]></summary>

A novel heuristic approach is proposed here for time series data analysis, dubbed Generalized weighted permutation entropy, which amalgamates and generalizes beyond their original scope two well established data analysis methods: Permutation entropy and Weighted permutation entropy. The method introduces a scaling parameter to discern the disorder and complexity of ordinal patterns with small and large fluctuations. Using this scaling parameter, the complexity-entropy causality plane is generalized to the complexity-entropy-scale causality box. Simulations conducted on synthetic series generated by stochastic, chaotic, and random processes, as well as real world data, are shown to produce unique signatures in this three dimensional representation.]]></summary>

Discrete dynamical systems in which model components take on categorical values have been successfully applied to biological networks to study their global dynamic behavior. Boolean models in particular have been used extensively. However, multi-state models have also emerged as effective computational tools for the analysis of complex mechanisms underlying biological networks. Models in which variables assume more than two discrete states provide greater resolution, but this scheme introduces discontinuities. In particular, variables can increase or decrease by more than one unit in one time step. This can be corrected, without changing fixed points of the system, by applying an additional rule to each local activation function. On the other hand, if one is interested in cyclic attractors of their system, then this rule can potentially introduce new cyclic attractors that were not observed previously. This article makes some advancements in understanding the state space dynamics of multi-state network models with synchronous, sequential, or block-sequential update schedules and establishes conditions under which no new cyclic attractors are added to networks when the additional rule is applied. Our analytical results have the potential to be incorporated into modeling software and aid researchers in their analyses of biological multi-state networks.]]></summary>

We study a dynamical system defined by a repeated game on a 1D lattice, in which the players keep track of their gross payoffs over time in a bank. Strategy updates are governed by a Boltzmann distribution, which depends on the neighborhood bank values associated with each strategy, relative to a temperature scale, which defines the random fluctuations. Players with higher bank values are, thus, less likely to change strategy than players with a lower bank value. For a parameterized rock–paper–scissors game, we derive a condition under which communities of a given strategy form with either fixed or drifting boundaries. We show the effect of a temperature increase on the underlying system and identify surprising properties of this model through numerical simulations.]]></summary>

To analyze the spread of infectious diseases among different areas, e.g., communities, cities, or countries, we construct a network, based on the epidemic model and the network coupling, whose nodes denote areas, and edges represent population migrations between two areas. Each node follows its dynamic, which describes an epidemic spreading among individuals in an area, and the node also interacts with other nodes, which indicates the spreading among different areas. By giving mathematical proof, we deduce that our model has a stable solution despite the network structure. We propose the peak infected ratio (PIR) as a property of infectious diseases in a certain area, which is not independent of the network structure. We find that increasing the population mobility or the disease infectiousness both cause higher peak infected population all over different by simulation. Furthermore, we apply our model to real-world data on COVID-19 and after properly adjusting the parameters of our model, the distribution of the peak infection ratio in different areas can be well fitted.]]></summary>

We investigate two types of avoided crossings in a chaotic billiard within the framework of information theory. The Shannon entropy in the phase space for the Landau–Zener interaction increases as the center of the avoided crossing is approached, whereas for the Demkov interaction, the Shannon entropy decreases as the center of avoided crossing is passed by with an increase in the deformation parameter. This feature can provide a new indicator for scar formation. In addition, it is found that the Fisher information of the Landau–Zener interaction is significantly larger than that of the Demkov interaction.]]></summary>

In this paper, we consider a three-tiered food web model in a chemostat, including chlorophenol, phenol, and hydrogen substrates and their degraders. The model takes into account the three substrate inflowing concentrations, as well as maintenance, that is, decay terms of the species. The operating diagrams give the asymptotic behavior of the model with respect to the four operating parameters, which are the dilution rate and the three inflowing concentrations of the substrates. These diagrams were obtained only numerically in the existing literature. Using the mathematical analysis of this model obtained in our previous studies, we construct the operating diagrams, by plotting the curves that separate their various regions. Hence, the regions of the operating diagrams are constructed analytically and there is no requirement for time-consuming algorithms to generate the plots, as in the numerical method. Moreover, our method reveals behaviors that have not been detected in the previous numerical studies. The growth functions are of Monod form with the inclusion of a product inhibition term. However, our method applies for a large class of growth functions. We construct operating diagrams with and without maintenance showing the role of maintenance on the stability of the system.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Adaptive Galerkin methods for time-dependent partial differential equations are studied and shown to be dissipative. The adaptation implies that the subset of the selected basis function changes over time according to the evolution of the solution. The corresponding projection operator is thus time-dependent and nondifferentiable. We therefore propose to use an integral formulation in time. We analyze the existence and uniqueness of this weak form of the dynamical Galerkin scheme, and we then prove that the nonsmooth projection operator introduces energy dissipation, which is a crucial result for adaptive Galerkin methods, e.g., adaptive wavelet methods. Numerical examples for the inviscid Burgers equation in one dimension and the incompressible Euler equations in two and three spatial dimensions show that the selection of basis functions, for instance by filtering out weak wavelet coefficients from the solution, introduces energy dissipation. Moreover, for the Burgers case we can show that adaptive wavelet regularization yields convergence of the truncated Galerkin solution to the physically relevant entropy solution. These results motivate adaptive wavelet-based Galerkin schemes for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws.]]></summary>

 Abstract. Using a multiscale analysis, we derive a sharp interface limit for the dynamics of bilayer structures of the functionalized Cahn–Hilliard equation with a cutoff diffusion mobility [math] that is degenerate for [math] and a continuously differentiable double-well potential [math]. We show that the bilayer interface does not move in the [math] time scale. The interface motion occurs in the [math] time scale and is determined by porous medium diffusion processes in both phases with no jumps on the interface. In the longer [math] time scale, the interface motion is a complex combination of porous medium diffusion processes in both phases and the property of mass conservation.]]></summary>

In this paper we consider a partially augmented fully-mixed variational formulation that has been recently proposed for the coupling of the stationary Brinkman–Forchheimer and double-diffusion equations, and develop an a posteriori error analysis for the 2D and 3D versions of the associated mixed finite element scheme. Indeed, we derive two reliable and efficient residual-based a posteriori error estimators for this problem on arbitrary (convex or non-convex) polygonal and polyhedral regions. The reliability of the proposed estimators draws mainly upon the uniform ellipticity and inf-sup condition of the forms involved, a suitable assumption on the data, stable Helmholtz decompositions in Hilbert and Banach frameworks, and the local approximation properties of the Clément and Raviart–Thomas operators. In turn, inverse inequalities, the localization technique based on bubble functions, and known results from previous works, are the main tools yielding the efficiency estimate. Finally, several numerical examples confirming the theoretical properties of the estimators and illustrating the performance of the associated adaptive algorithms, are reported. In particular, the case of flow through a 3D porous media with channel networks is considered.]]></summary>

Multi-dimensional image recovery from incomplete data is a fundamental problem in data processing. Due to its advantage of capturing the correlations between any modes of the multi-dimensional image, i.e., the target tensor, the fully-connected tensor network (FCTN) decomposition has recently shown promising performance on multi-dimensional image recovery. However, FCTN decomposition suffers from computational deficiency, especially for large-scale multi-dimensional images. To address this deficiency, we propose a learnable transform-based FCTN model (termed as T-FCTN), which enjoys the remarkable advantage of FCTN decomposition with cheap computational cost. More concretely, we learn the semi-orthogonal transforms along each mode of the target tensor to project the large-scale te…]]></summary>

The purpose of this work is to describe in detail the development of the spectral difference Raviart–Thomas (SDRT) formulation for two and three-dimensional tensor-product elements and simplexes. Through the process, the authors establish the equivalence between the SDRT method and the flux reconstruction (FR) approach under the assumption of the linearity of the flux and the mesh uniformity. Such a connection allows building a new family of FR schemes for two and three-dimensional simplexes and also to recover the well-known FR-SD method with tensor-product elements. In addition, a thorough analysis of the numerical dissipation and dispersion of both aforementioned schemes and the nodal discontinuous Galerkin FR (FR-DG) method with two and three-dimensional elements is proposed through the use of the combined-mode Fourier approach. SDRT is shown to possess an enhanced temporal linear stability in comparison to FR-DG. On the contrary, SDRT displays larger dissipation and dispersion errors with respect to FR-DG. Finally, the study is concluded with a set of numerical experiments, the linear advection-diffusion problem, the Isentropic Euler Vortex, and the Taylor-Green Vortex (TGV). The latter test case shows that SDRT schemes present a non-linear unstable behavior with simplex elements and certain polynomial degrees. For the sake of completeness, the matrix form of the SDRT method is developed and the computational performance of SDRT with respect to FR schemes is evaluated using GPU architectures.]]></summary>

Matrix and tensor nuclear norms have been successfully used to promote the low-rankness of tensors in low-rank tensor completion. However, singular value decomposition (SVD), which is computationally expensive for large-scale matrices, frequently appears in solving those nuclear norm minimization models. Based on the tensor-tensor product (T-product), in this paper, we first establish the equivalence between the so-called transformed tubal nuclear norm for a third-order tensor and the minimum of the sum of two factor tensors’ squared Frobenius norms under a general invertible linear transform. Gainfully, we introduce a mode-unfolding (often named as “spatio-temporal” in the internet traffic data recovery literature) regularized tensor completion model that is able to efficiently exploit the hidden structures of tensors. Then, we propose an implementable alternating minimization algorithm to solve the underlying optimization model. It is remarkable that our approach does not require any SVDs and all subproblems of our algorithm enjoy closed-form solutions. A series of numerical experiments on traffic data recovery, color images and videos inpainting demonstrate that our SVD-free approach takes less computing time to achieve satisfactory accuracy than some state-of-the-art tensor nuclear norm minimization approaches.]]></summary>

We present a unifying, tractable approach for studying the spread of viruses causing complex diseases requiring to be modeled using a large number of types (e.g., infective stage, clinical state, risk factor class). We show that recording each infected individual’s infection age, i.e., the time elapsed since infection, has three benefits. First, regardless of the number of types, the age distribution of the population can be described by means of a first-order, one-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE) known as the McKendrick-von Foerster equation. The frequency of type i is simply obtained by integrating the probability of being in state i at a given age against the age distribution. This representation induces a simple methodology based on the additional assumption of Poisson sampling to infer and forecast the epidemic. We illustrate this technique using French data from the COVID-19 epidemic. Second, our approach generalizes and simplifies standard compartmental models using high-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to account for disease complexity. We show that such models can always be rewritten in our framework, thus, providing a low-dimensional yet equivalent representation of these complex models. Third, beyond the simplicity of the approach, we show that our population model naturally appears as a universal scaling limit of a large class of fully stochastic individual-based epidemic models, where the initial condition of the PDE emerges as the limiting age structure of an exponentially growing population starting from a single individual.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We describe an efficient domain decomposition-based framework for nonlinear multiscale PDE problems. The framework is inspired by manifold learning techniques and exploits the tangent spaces spanned by the nearest neighbors to compress local solution manifolds. Our framework is applied to a semilinear elliptic equation with oscillatory media and a nonlinear radiative transfer equation; in both cases, significant improvements in efficacy are observed. This new method does not rely on a detailed analytical understanding of multiscale PDEs, such as their asymptotic limits, and thus is more versatile for general multiscale problems.]]></summary>

 Abstract. In this paper, an online multiscale model reduction method is presented for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with multiplicative noise, where the diffusion coefficient is spatially multiscale and the noise perturbation nonlinearly depends on the diffusion dynamics. It is necessary to efficiently compute all possible trajectories of the stochastic dynamics for quantifying a model’s uncertainty and statistic moments. The multiscale diffusion and nonlinearity may cause the computation to become very intractable. To overcome the multiscale difficulty, a constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) is used to localize the computation and obtain an effective coarse model. However, the nonlinear terms are still defined on a fine scale space after the Galerkin projection of CEM-GMsFEM is applied to the nonlinear SPDEs. This significantly impacts the simulation efficiency by CEM-GMsFEM. To this end, a stochastic online discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) is proposed to treat the stochastic nonlinearity. The stochastic online DEIM incorporates offline snapshots and online snapshots. The offline snapshots consist of the nonlinear terms at the approximate mean of the stochastic dynamics and are used to construct an offline reduced model. The online snapshots contain some information of the current new trajectory and are used to correct the offline reduced model in an incremental manner. The stochastic online DEIM substantially reduces the dimension of the nonlinear dynamics and enhances the prediction accuracy for the reduced model. Thus, the online multiscale model reduction is constructed by using CEM-GMsFEM and the stochastic online DEIM. A priori error analysis is carried out for the nonlinear SPDEs. We present a few numerical examples with diffusion in heterogeneous porous media and show the effectiveness of the proposed model reduction.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We study mathematical models and approximations for the sedimentation in suspensions of rod-like particles. The starting point of our considerations is a coupled system of partial differential equations, previously derived by Helzel and Tzavaras [Multiscale Model.  Simul., 15 (2017), pp.  500–536], consisting of a kinetic equation for the rod orientation that is coupled to a macroscopic flow equation. It describes the motion of a suspension of rigid rod-like particles under the influence of gravity. Since the coupled system is high dimensional (five dimensions plus time) we are interested in the derivation of models which can adaptively adjust the level of detail. Here we restrict ourselves to simplified lower dimensional flow situations and derive hierarchies of moment equations which can be interpreted as approximations of the coupled kinetic model. We show that the resulting systems of moment equations are hyperbolic.]]></summary>

 Abstract. We establish improved uniform error bounds on time-splitting methods for the long-time dynamics of the Dirac equation with small electromagnetic potentials characterized by a dimensionless parameter [math] representing the amplitude of the potentials. We begin with a semidiscretization of the Dirac equation in time by a time-splitting method, followed by a full-discretization in space by with the Fourier pseudospectral method in space. By employing the unitary flow property of the second-order time-splitting method for the Dirac equation, we prove uniform error bounds for [math] at [math] and [math] for the semidiscretization and full-discretization, respectively, for any time [math] with [math] and [math]. In the expressions, [math] is the time step, [math] is the mesh size, [math] depends on the regularity of the solution, and [math] grows at most linearly with respect to [math] with [math] and [math] two constants independent of [math], [math], [math], and [math]. Then by adopting the regularity compensation oscillation technique, which controls the high frequency modes by the regularity of the solution and low frequency modes by phase cancellation and energy method, we establish improved uniform error bounds at [math] and [math] for the semidiscretization and full-discretization, respectively, up to the long-time [math]. Numerical results are reported to confirm our error bounds and to demonstrate that they are sharp. Comparisons on the accuracy of different time discretizations for the Dirac equation are also provided.]]></summary>

The activity generated by an ensemble of neurons is affected by various noise sources. It is a well-recognised challenge to understand the effects of noise on the stability of such networks. We demonstrate that the patterns of activity generated by networks of grid cells emerge from the instability of homogeneous activity for small levels of noise. This is carried out by analysing the robustness of network activity patterns with respect to noise in an upscaled noisy grid cell model in the form of a system of partial differential equations. Inhomogeneous network patterns are numerically understood as branches bifurcating from unstable homogeneous states for small noise levels. We show that there is a phase transition occurring as the level of noise decreases. Our numerical study also indicates the presence of hysteresis phenomena close to the precise critical noise value.]]></summary>

Sixth-order compact difference schemes for Poisson equations have been widely investigated in the literature. Nevertheless, those methods are all constructed based on knowing the exact values of the derivatives of the source term. Therefore, this drawback mostly prevents their actual applications as the analytic form of the source term is rarely available. In this paper, we propose a sixth-order quasi-compact difference method, without having to know the derivatives of the source term, for solving the 2D and 3D Poisson equations. Our strategy is to discretize the equation by the fourth-order compact scheme at the improper interior grid points that adjoin the boundary, while the sixth-order scheme, where it is compact only for the unknowns, is exploited to the proper interior grid points that are not adjoining the boundary. Theoretically, we rigorously prove that the proposed method can achieve the global sixth-order accuracy. Since there are no derivatives of the source term involved in the proposed scheme, our global sixth-order quasi-compact difference method can be developed to solve the time-dependent problems using a time advancing scheme. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the convergence order and the efficiency of the proposed methods.]]></summary>

We analyze an ‘up-the-gradient’ model for the formation of transport channels of the phytohormone auxin, through auxin-mediated polarization of the PIN1 auxin transporter. We show that this model admits a family of travelling wave solutions that is parameterized by the height of the auxin-pulse. We uncover scaling relations for the speed and width of these waves and verify these rigorous results with numerical computations. In addition, we provide explicit expressions for the leading-order wave profiles, which allows the influence of the biological parameters in the problem to be readily identified. Our proofs are based on a generalization of the scaling principle developed by Friesecke and Pego to construct pulse solutions to the classic Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou model, which describes a one-dimensional chain of coupled nonlinear springs.]]></summary>

The estimation from available data of parameters governing epidemics is a major challenge. In addition to usual issues (data often incomplete and noisy), epidemics of the same nature may be observed in several places or over different periods. The resulting possible inter-epidemic variability is rarely explicitly considered. Here, we propose to tackle multiple epidemics through a unique model incorporating a stochastic representation for each epidemic and to jointly estimate its parameters from noisy and partial observations. By building on a previous work for prevalence data, a Gaussian state-space model is extended to a model with mixed effects on the parameters describing simultaneously several epidemics and their observation process. An appropriate inference method is developed, by coupling the SAEM algorithm with Kalman-type filtering. Moreover, we consider here incidence data, which requires to develop a new version of the filtering algorithm. Its performances are investigated on SIR simulated epidemics for prevalence and incidence data. Our method outperforms an inference method separately processing each dataset. An application to SEIR influenza outbreaks in France over several years using incidence data is also carried out. Parameter estimations highlight a non-negligible variability between influenza seasons, both in transmission and case reporting. The main contribution of our study is to rigorously and explicitly account for the inter-epidemic variability between multiple outbreaks, both from the viewpoint of modeling and inference with a parsimonious statistical model.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and wavelet-based multi-resolution technique, which refine the spatial resolution in regions of interest and coarsen the mesh in other regions, are widely used in scientific computing for higher computational efficiency. The key component of AMR and the multi-resolution method is the adaptation strategy including the regularity estimation. In this paper, a new adaptation strategy for AMR and the multi-resolution method is proposed. Different from AMR, which measures the function regularity based on an empirical gradient operator, and the multi-resolution method with complicated wavelet analysis, the new approach examines the solution smoothness based on the high-order TENO reconstruction (Fu et al. in J Comput Phys 305:333–359, 2016). The core idea is that the TENO scheme not only provides the reconstructed data at the cell interface for flux evaluation but also classifies the local flow scales as smooth or nonsmooth on the discretized mesh. Since the scale-separation procedure is achieved in the spectral and characteristic space, the new adaptation strategy is weakly problem-dependent. Moreover, the extra complexity due to the empirical gradient computing or the wavelet analysis is eliminated. Based on Harten’s finite-volume multi-resolution method (Harten in J Comput Phys 115(2):319–338, 1994), a set of benchmark cases is simulated to validate the performance of the proposed method.]]></summary>

A model of population growth and dispersal is considered where the spatial habitat is a lattice and reproduction occurs generationally. The resulting discrete dynamical system exhibits velocity locking, where rational speed invasion fronts are observed to persist as parameters are varied. In this article, we construct locked fronts for a particular piecewise linear reproduction function. These fronts are shown to be linear combinations of exponentially decaying solutions to the linear system near the unstable state. Based upon these front solutions, we then derive expressions for the boundary of locking regions in parameter space. We obtain leading order expansions for the locking regions in the limit as the migration parameter tends to zero. Strict spectral stability in exponentially weighted spaces is also established.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
Identifying early warning signs of sudden population changes and mechanisms leading to regime shifts are highly desirable in population biology. In this paper, a two-trophic ecosystem comprising of two species of predators, competing for their common prey, with explicit interference competition is considered. With proper rescaling, the model is portrayed as a singularly perturbed system with fast prey dynamics and slow dynamics of the predators. In a parameter regime near singular Hopf bifurcation, chaotic mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs), featuring concatenation of small and large amplitude oscillations are observed as long-lasting transients before the system approaches its asymptotic state. To analyze the dynamical cause that initiates a large amplitude oscillation in an MMO orbit, the model is reduced to a suitable normal form near the singular-Hopf point. The normal form possesses a separatrix surface that separates two different types of oscillations. A large amplitude oscillation is initiated if a trajectory moves from the “inner” to the “outer side” of this surface. A set of conditions on the normal form variables are obtained to determine whether a trajectory would exhibit another cycle of MMO dynamics before experiencing a regime shift (i.e. approaching its asymptotic state). These conditions serve as early warning signs for a sudden population shift as well as detect the onset of a regime shift in this ecological model.]]></summary>

In the present paper, we solve the steady state diffusion equation in 3D domains by means of a cell-centered finite volume method that uses a Multipoint Flux Approximation with a Diamond Stencil and a Non-Linear defect correction strategy (MPFA-DNL) to guarantee the Discrete Maximum Principle (DMP). Our formulation is based in the fact that the flux of MPFA methods can be split into two different parts: a Two Point Flux Approximation (TPFA) component and the Cross-Diffusion Terms (CDT). In the linear MPFA-D method, this split is particularly simple since it lies at the core of the original method construction. In this context, we introduce a non-linear defect correction, aiming to mitigate, whenever necessary, the contributions from the CDT, avoiding, this way, spurious oscillations and DMP violations. Our new MPFA-DNL scheme is locally conservative and capable of dealing with arbitrary anisotropic diffusion tensors and unstructured meshes, without harming the second order convergence rates of the original MPFA-D. To appraise the accuracy and robustness of our formulation, we solve some benchmark problems found in literature. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to tetrahedral meshes, even though, in principle, there is no restriction to extend the method to other polyhedral control volumes.]]></summary>
