          "description": "Abstract\nHigher-order Markov chain plays an important role in analyzing a variety of stochastic processes over time in multi-dimensional spaces. One of the important applications is the study of higher-order PageRank problem. The truncated power method proposed recently provides us with another idea to solve this problem, however, its accuracy and efficiency can be poor in practical computations. In this work, we revisit the higher-order PageRank problem and consider how to solve it efficiently. The contribution of this work is as follows. First, we accelerate the truncated power method for higher-order PageRank. In the improved version, it is neither to form and store the vectors arising from the dangling states, nor to store an auxiliary matrix. Second, we propose a truncated power method with partially updating to further release the overhead, in which one only needs to update some important columns of the approximation in each iteration. However, the truncated power method solves a modified higher-order PageRank model for convenience, which is not mathematically equivalent to the original one. Thus, the third contribution of this work is to propose a sparse power method with partially updating for the original higher-order PageRank problem. The convergence of all the proposed methods are discussed. Numerical experiments on large and sparse real-world and synthetic data sets are performed. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our new algorithms over some state-of-the-art ones for large and sparse higher-order PageRank problems.",

Motivated by the direct sampling method (DSM) proposed in Chow et al. (SIAM J Sci Comput 37(4):A1658–A1684, 2015), we develop a deep direct sampling method (DDSM) to recover the inhomogeneous inclusions buried in a homogeneous background. In this method, we design a convolutional neural network to approximate the index functional that mimics the underling mathematical structure. The benefits of the proposed DDSM include fast and easy implementation, capability of incorporating multiple measurements to attain high-quality reconstruction, and advanced robustness against the noise. Numerical experiments show that the reconstruction accuracy is improved without degrading the efficiency, demonstrating its potential for solving the real-world DOT problems.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIt is quite common that a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) admits multiple distinct solutions and each solution may carry a unique physical meaning. One typical approach for finding multiple solutions is to use the Newton method with different initial guesses that ideally fall into the basins of attraction confining the solutions. In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate numerical method for multiple solutions comprised of three ingredients: (i) a well-designed spectral-Galerkin discretization of the underlying PDE leading to a nonlinear algebraic system (NLAS) with multiple solutions; (ii) an effective deflation technique to eliminate a known (founded) solution from the other unknown solutions leading to deflated NLAS; and (iii) a viable nonlinear least-squares and trust-region (LSTR) method for solving the NLAS and the deflated NLAS to find the multiple solutions sequentially one by one. We demonstrate through ample examples of differential equations and comparison with relevant existing approaches that the spectral LSTR-Deflation method has the merits: (i) it is quite flexible in choosing initial values, even starting from the same initial guess for finding all multiple solutions; (ii) it guarantees high-order accuracy; and (iii) it is quite fast to locate multiple distinct solutions and explore new solutions which are not reported in literature.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe address the solution of large-scale Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) with infinite-dimensional parameter fields. The OED problem seeks to find sensor locations that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) in the solution of the underlying Bayesian inverse problem. Computation of the EIG is usually prohibitive for PDE-based OED problems. To make the evaluation of the EIG tractable, we approximate the (PDE-based) parameter-to-observable map with a derivative-informed projected neural network (DIPNet) surrogate, which exploits the geometry, smoothness, and intrinsic low-dimensionality of the map using a small and dimension-independent number of PDE solves. The surrogate is then deployed within a greedy algorithm-based solution of the OED problem such that no further PDE solves are required. We analyze the EIG approximation error in terms of the generalization error of the DIPNet and show they are of the same order. Finally, the efficiency and accuracy of the method are demonstrated via numerical experiments on OED problems governed by inverse scattering and inverse reactive transport with up to 16,641 uncertain parameters and 100 experimental design variables, where we observe up to three orders of magnitude speedup relative to a reference double loop Monte Carlo method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper applies an idea of adaptive momentum for the nonlinear conjugate gradient to accelerate optimization problems in sparse recovery. Specifically, we consider two types of minimization problems: a (single) differentiable function and the sum of a non-smooth function and a differentiable function. In the first case, we adopt a fixed step size to avoid the traditional line search and establish the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm for a quadratic problem. This acceleration is further incorporated with an operator splitting technique to deal with the non-smooth function in the second case. We use the convex \n                      \n                      \\(\\ell _1\\)\n                      \n                     and the nonconvex \n                      \n                      \\(\\ell _1-\\ell _2\\)\n                      \n                     functionals as two case studies to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches over traditional methods.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, the binary fluid-surfactant phase field model on evolving surfaces is presented and numerically studied for interfacial sciences. Based on the evolving surface finite element method, the first-order and second-order standard semi-implicit schemes are shown and analyzed to be conditionally stable. The energy dissipation law of the binary fluid-surfactant phase field model does not hold for evolving surfaces with arbitrary surface velocities which can be viewed as an action of external force. Therefore, this paper is dedicated to addressing the difficulties of conditional stability and numerical stiffness caused by the small interfacial parameters instead of energy stability. The first-order and second-order stabilizing approaches are employed to improve the stabilities of semi-implicit schemes. For the efficiency of long time simulation, an adaptive time-stepping technique considering energy evolution and surface velocity is developed. The effectiveness of the proposed stabilizing and adaptive time-stepping approaches is verified by numerical experiments. Various numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, and numerically investigate the behavior of the binary fluid-surfactant on evolving surfaces.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this work, we propose a new class of parallel time integrators for initial-value problems based on the well-known Picard iteration. To this end, we first investigate a class of sequential integrators, known as numerical Picard iteration methods, which falls into the general framework of deferred correction methods. We show that the numerical Picard iteration methods admit a \n                      \n                      \\(\\min (J,M+1)\\)\n                      \n                    -order rate of convergence, where J denotes the number of Picard iterations and \n                      \n                      \\(M+1\\)\n                      \n                     is the number of collocation points. We then propose a class of parallel solvers so that J Picard iterations can be proceeded simultaneously and nearly constantly. We show that the parallel solvers yield the same convergence rate as that of the numerical Picard iteration methods. The main features of the proposed parallelized approach are as follows. (1) Instead of computing the solution point by point [as in revisionist integral deferred correction (RIDC) methods], the proposed methods proceed segment by segment. (2) The proposed approach leads to a higher speedup; the speedup is shown to be \n                      \n                      \\(J(M+1)\\)\n                      \n                     (while the speedup of the Jth order RIDC is, at most, J). (3) The approach is applicable for non-uniform points, such as Chebyshev points. The stability region of the proposed methods is analyzed in detail, and we present numerical examples to verify the theoretical findings.",

Based on staggered grids, a discrete scheme using finite difference methods is constructed in a form similar to domain decomposition. On this basis, another discrete scheme with a uniform form over the entire domain is derived. These two discrete schemes serve different purposes and are shown to be equivalent. The stability is easily derived by establishing a discrete variational formulation. To prove the convergence, appropriate discrete interpolations are introduced. It is proved that the discrete scheme has second-order superconvergence. Then, combined with the inf-sup condition, the first-order uniform convergence is obtained. This means the discrete scheme has great potential to overcome Poisson locking and pressure oscillations. Some numerical experiments are also carried out, and the results show the robustness and efficiency of the discrete scheme.",

In this research, we propose an online basis enrichment strategy within the framework of a recently developed constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale discontinuous Galerkin method. Combining the technique of oversampling, one makes use of the information of the current residuals to adaptively construct basis functions in the online stage to reduce the error of multiscale approximation. A complete analysis of the method is presented, which shows the proposed online enrichment leads to a fast convergence from multiscale approximation to the fine-scale solution. The error reduction can be made sufficiently large by suitably selecting oversampling regions and the number of oversampling layers. Further, the convergence rate of the enrichment algorithm depends on a factor of exponential decay regarding the number of oversampling layers and a user-defined parameter.

We present a butterfly-compressed representation of the Hadamard–Babich (HB) ansatz for the Green’s function of the high-frequency Helmholtz equation in smooth inhomogeneous media. For a computational domain discretized with [math] discretization cells, the proposed algorithm first solves and tabulates the phase and HB coefficients via eikonal and transport equations with observation points and point sources located at the Chebyshev nodes using a set of much coarser computation grids, and then butterfly compresses the resulting HB interactions from all [math] cell centers to each other. The overall CPU time and memory requirement scale as [math] for any bounded two-dimensional (2D) domains with arbitrary excitation sources. A direct extension of this scheme to bounded 3D domains yields an [math] CPU complexity, which can be further reduced to quasi-linear complexities with proposed remedies. The scheme can also efficiently handle scattering problems involving inclusions in inhomogeneous media. Although the current construction of our HB integrator does not accommodate caustics, the resulting HB integrator itself can be applied to certain sources, such as concave-shaped sources, to produce caustic effects. Compared to finite-difference frequency domain methods, the proposed HB integrator is free of numerical dispersion and requires fewer discretization points per wavelength. As a result, it can solve wave propagation problems well beyond the capability of existing solvers. Remarkably, the proposed scheme can accurately model wave propagation in 2D domains with 640 wavelengths per direction and in 3D domains with 54 wavelengths per direction on a state-of-the-art supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.",

In this paper, we present strong numerical evidence that the incompressible axisymmetric Euler equations with degenerate viscosity coefficients and smooth initial data of finite energy develop a potential finite-time locally self-similar singularity at the origin. An important feature of this potential singularity is that the solution develops a two-scale traveling wave that travels toward the origin. The two-scale feature is characterized by the scaling property that the center of the traveling wave is located at a ring of radius [math] surrounding the symmetry axis while the thickness of the ring collapses at a rate [math]. The driving mechanism for this potential singularity is due to an antisymmetric vortex dipole that generates a strong shearing layer in both the radial and axial velocity fields. Without the viscous regularization, the three-dimensional Euler equations develop a sharp front and some shearing instability in the far field. On the other hand, the Navier–Stokes equations with a constant viscosity coefficient regularize the two-scale solution structure and do not develop a finite-time singularity for the same initial data.",

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a huge threat to global public health. Motivated by China’s experience of using Fangcang shelter hospitals (FSHs) to successfully combat the epidemic in its initial stages, we present a two-stage delay model considering the average waiting time of patients’ admission to study the impact of hospital beds and centralized quarantine on mitigating and controlling of the outbreak. We compute the basic reproduction number in terms of the hospital resources and perform a sensitivity analysis of the average waiting times of patients before admission to the hospitals. We conclude that, while designated hospitals save lives in severely infected individuals, the FSHs played a key role in mitigating and eventually curbing the epidemic. We also quantified some key epidemiological indicators, such as the final size of infections and deaths, the peak height and its timing, and the maximum occupation of beds in FSHs. Our study suggests that, for a jurisdiction (region or country) still struggling with COVID-19, when possible, it is essential to increase testing capacity and use a centralized quarantine to massively reduce the severity and magnitude of the epidemic that follows.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Volume 83, Issue 1, Page 254-275, February 2023. \n Abstract. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and myosin-dependent contraction can generate elastic stress and strain in living tissues, which may be dissipated by internal rearrangement through cell topological transition and cytoskeletal reorganization. Moreover, cells and tissues can change their sizes in response to mechanical cues. The present work demonstrates the role of tissue compressibility and internal rearranging activities on its size and mechanics regulation in the context of differential growth induced by a field of growth-promoting chemical factors. We develop a mathematical model based on finite elasticity and growth theory and the reference map techniques to describe the coupled tissue growth and mechanics in the Eulerian frame. We incorporate the tissue rearrangement by introducing a rearranging rate to the reference map evolution, leading to elastic-energy dissipation when tissue growth and deformation are in radial symmetry. By linearizing the model, we show that the stress follows the Maxwell-type viscoelastic relaxation. The rearrangement rate, which we call tissue fluidity, sets the stress relaxation time, and the ratio between the shear modulus and the fluidity sets the tissue viscosity. By nonlinear simulation of growing tissue spheroids and discs with graded growth rates along the radius, we find that the tissue compressibility and fluidity influence their equilibrium size. By comparing the nonlinear simulations with the linear analytical solutions, we show the size change as a nonlinear effect due to the advection of the tissue density flow, which only occurs when both tissue compressibility and fluidity are small. We apply the model to study tumor spheroid growth and epithelial disc growth when a reaction-diffusion process determines the growth-promoting factor field.",

This paper is concerned with uniqueness of solution of the inverse diffraction by problems by a periodic curve with Dirichlet boundary condition in two dimensions. It is proved that the periodic curve can be uniquely determined by the near-field measurement data corresponding to infinitely many incident plane waves with distinct directions at a fixed frequency. Our proof is based on Schiffer’s idea which consists of two ingredients: (i) the total fields for incident plane waves with distinct directions are linearly independent, and (ii) for a fixed wave number there exist only finitely many linearly independent Dirichlet eigenfunctions in a bounded domain or in a closed waveguide under additional assumptions on the waveguide boundary. Based on the Rayleigh expansion, we prove that the phased near-field data can be uniquely determined by the phaseless near-field data in a bounded domain, with the exception of a finite set of incident angles. Such a phase retrieval result leads to a new uniqueness result for the inverse grating diffraction problem with phaseless near-field data at a fixed frequency. Since the incident direction determines the quasi-periodicity of the boundary value problem, our inverse issues are different from the existing results of [F. Hettlich and A. Kirsch, Inverse Problems, 13 (1997), pp. 351–361], where fixed-direction plane waves at multiple frequencies were considered.",

We construct a formal gradient flow structure for phase-field evolution coupled to mechanics in Lagrangian coordinates, present common ways to couple the evolution, and provide an incremental minimization strategy. While the usual presentation of continuum mechanics is intentionally brief, we construct an extensible functional analytical framework and a discretization approach that preserves the underlying variational structure. We consider phase separation and swelling of gels and then study stationary states of multiphase systems with surface tension and contact lines and show the robustness of the general approach for large deformations. We highlight differences between compressible and incompressible models and discuss issues of the sharp-interface limit for different magnitudes of the Cahn–Hilliard mobility.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 52, Issue 2, Page 327-357, April 2023. \n Abstract. We study the Generalized Min Sum Set Cover (GMSSC) problem, wherein given a collection of hyperedges [math] with arbitrary covering requirements [math], the goal is to find an ordering of the vertices to minimize the total cover time of the hyperedges; a hyperedge [math] is considered covered by the first time when [math] and many of its vertices appear in the ordering. We give a [math] approximation algorithm for GMSSC, coming close to the best possible bound of 4, already for the classical special case (with all [math]) of Min Sum Set Cover (MSSC) studied by Feige, Lovász, and Tetali, and improving upon the previous best known bound of [math] due to Im, Sviridenko, and van der Zwaan. Our algorithm is based on transforming the LP solution by a suitable kernel and applying randomized rounding. As part of the analysis of our algorithm, we also derive an inequality on the lower tail of a sum of independent Bernoulli random variables, which might be of independent interest and broader utility. Min Sum Vertex Cover (MSVC) is a well-known special case of MSSC in which the input hypergraph is a graph (i.e., [math]) and [math] for every edge [math]. We give a [math] approximation for MSVC and show a matching integrality gap for the natural LP relaxation. This improves upon the previous best [math] approximation of Barenholz, Feige, and Peleg. Finally, we revisit MSSC and consider the [math] norm of cover-time of the hyperedges. Using a dual fitting argument, we show that the natural greedy algorithm achieves tight, up to NP-hardness, approximation guarantees of [math] for all [math], giving another proof of the result of Golovin, Gupta, Kumar, and Tangwongsan, and showing its tightness up to NP-hardness. For [math], this gives yet another proof of the 4 approximation for MSSC.",

The complexity of this problem is tied to parameterized versions of [math] and [math], among other questions.
