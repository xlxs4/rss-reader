          "description": "Abstract\nWe investigate the properties of some recently developed variable-order differential operators involving order transition functions of exponential type. Since the characterization of such operators is performed in the Laplace domain, it is necessary to resort to accurate numerical methods to derive the corresponding behaviours in the time domain. In this regard, we develop a computational procedure to solve variable-order fractional differential equations of this novel class. Furthermore, we provide some numerical experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.",

          "description": "Abstract\nPhysical models with uncertain inputs are commonly represented as parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). That is, PDEs with inputs that are expressed as functions of parameters with an associated probability distribution. Developing efficient and accurate solution strategies that account for errors on the space, time and parameter domains simultaneously is highly challenging. Indeed, it is well known that standard polynomial-based approximations on the parameter domain can incur errors that grow in time. In this work, we focus on advection–diffusion problems with parameter-dependent wind fields. A novel adaptive solution strategy is proposed that allows users to combine stochastic collocation on the parameter domain with off-the-shelf adaptive timestepping algorithms with local error control. This is a non-intrusive strategy that builds a polynomial-based surrogate that is adapted sequentially in time. The algorithm is driven by a so-called hierarchical estimator for the parametric error and balances this against an estimate for the global timestepping error which is derived from a scaling argument.",

          "description": "Abstract\nNon-overlapping Schwarz methods with generalized Robin transmission conditions were originally introduced by B. Després for time-harmonic wave propagation problems and have largely developed over the past thirty years. The aim of the paper is to provide both a review of the available formulations and methods as well as a consistent theory applicable to more general cases than studied until to date. An abstract variational framework is provided reformulating the original problem by the well-known form involving a scattering operator and an interface exchange operator, and the equivalence between the formulations is discussed thoroughly. The framework applies to a series of wave propagation problems throughout the de Rham complex, such as the scalar Helmholtz equation, Maxwell’s equations, a dual formulation of the Helmholtz equation in H(div), as well as any conforming finite element discretization thereof, and it applies also to coercive problems. Three convergence results are shown. The first one (using compactness) and the second one (based on absorption) generalize Després’ early findings and apply as well to the FETI-2LM formulation (a discrete method introduced by de La Bourdonnaye, Farhat, Macedo, Magoulés, and Roux). The third result, oriented on the work by Collino, Ghanemi, and Joly, establishes a convergence rate and covers cases with cross points, while not requiring any regularity of the solution. The key ingredient is a global interface exchange operator, proposed originally by X. Claeys and further developed by Claeys and Parolin, here worked out in full generality. The third type of convergence theory is applicable at the discrete level as well, where the exchange operator is allowed to be even local. The resulting scheme can be viewed as a generalization of the 2-Lagrange-multiplier method introduced by S. Loisel, and connections are drawn to another technique proposed by Gander and Santugini.",

Like all of the Godunov-type schemes, the proposed LDCU schemes are developed in three steps: reconstruction, evolution, and projection. A major novelty of our approach is in the projection step, which is based on a subcell resolution and designed to sharper approximate contact waves while ensuring a non-oscillatory property of the projected solution. In order to achieve this goal, we take into account properties of the contact waves. We design the LDCU schemes for both the one- and two-dimensional Euler equations of gas dynamics. The new schemes are tested on a variety of numerical examples. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that the proposed LDCU schemes contain substantially smaller amount of numerical dissipation and achieve higher resolution compared with their existing counterparts.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this work, we formulate a class of multiscale inverse problems within the framework of reinforcement learning (RL) and solve it by a sampling method. We propose a multi-agent actor-critic RL algorithm to accelerate the multi-level Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling once the problem is formulated as an RL process. The policies of the agents are used to generate proposals in the MCMC steps, and the critic, which is centralized, is in charge of estimating the expected reward. There are several difficulties in the implementation of the inverse problem involving features of multiple scales by using traditional MCMC sampling. Firstly, the computation of the posterior distribution involves evaluating the forward solver, which is time-consuming for problems with heterogeneities. This motivates to use the type of multi-level algorithms. Secondly, it is hard to find a proper transition function. To overcome these issues, we learn an RL policy as the proposal generator. We verify our proposed algorithm by solving different benchmark cases of multiscale inverse problems. Our experiments show that the proposed method improves the sampling process and speeds up the residual convergence.",

This algorithm is then applied to solve a nonlinear time-fractional biharmonic equation for illustration, in which the cut-off technique and the auxiliary scheme approach are used to reduce the requirement on the nonlinear term to the local Lipschitz continuous condition, and the energy estimates are performed to avoid the usage of the inverse estimates and thus the time-step conditions. To treat the fractional operator, the Alikhanov’s scheme on the graded mesh is applied to deal with the weak singularity at initial time, while the compact difference method based on the order reduction is employed for high-order spatial discretization. The above methods and improvements as well as the properties of the high-order mapping operator are integrated with the analysis of the two-grid method to prove the unique solvability and the unconditionally robust error estimates of the proposed schemes under different norms. The developed techniques are further extended to discretize and analyze the two-grid method of two-dimensional problems.

          "description": "Abstract\nIn the context of preserving stationary states, e.g. lake at rest and moving equilibria, a new formulation of the shallow water system, called flux globalization has been introduced by Cheng et al. (J Sci Comput 80(1):538–554, 2019). This approach consists in including the integral of the source term in the global flux and reconstructing the new global flux rather than the conservative variables. The resulting scheme is able to preserve a large family of smooth and discontinuous steady state moving equilibria. In this work, we focus on an arbitrary high order WENO finite volume (FV) generalization of the global flux approach. The most delicate aspect of the algorithm is the appropriate definition of the source flux (integral of the source term) and the quadrature strategy used to match it with the WENO reconstruction of the hyperbolic flux. When this construction is correctly done, one can show that the resulting WENO FV scheme admits exact discrete steady states characterized by constant global fluxes. We also show that, by an appropriate quadrature strategy for the source, we can embed exactly some particular steady states, e.g. the lake at rest for the shallow water equations. It can be shown that an exact approximation of global fluxes leads to a scheme with better convergence properties and improved solutions. The novel method has been tested and validated on classical cases: subcritical, supercritical and transcritical flows.",

Dynamical systems have a wide range of applications in mechanics, electrical engineering, chemistry, and so on. In this work, we propose the adaptive spectral Koopman (ASK) method to solve nonlinear autonomous dynamical systems. This novel numerical method leverages the spectral-collocation (i.e., pseudospectral) method and properties of the Koopman operator to obtain the solution of a dynamical system. Specifically, this solution is represented as a linear combination of the multiplication of the Koopman operator’s eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, and these eigenpairs are approximated by the spectral method. Unlike conventional time evolution algorithms such as Euler’s scheme and the Runge–Kutta scheme, ASK is mesh free and hence is more flexible when evaluating the solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate high accuracy of ASK for solving one-, two-, and three-dimensional dynamical systems.",

We consider steady states of dynamics that have an underlying network structure. We study how a steady state responds to small perturbations in the network parameters and how this sensitivity is connected to the network structure. We introduce a prototypical linear response equation and determine its sensitivity. This abstract result is applied to study the sensitivity of steady states in two common dynamics on networks: continuous-time Markov chains and deterministically modeled chemical reaction networks. For continuous-time Markov chains, we are able to efficiently compute the signs of the response in terms of the underlying network structure. The study of chemical reaction networks extends the sensitivity analysis to open systems with more complex network structures.",

Understanding and predicting the dynamical properties of systems involving dry friction is a major concern in physics and engineering. It abounds in many mechanical processes, from the sound produced by a violin to the screeching of chalk on a blackboard to human infant crawling dynamics and friction-based locomotion of a multitude of living organisms (snakes, bacteria, scallops) to the displacement of mechanical structures (building, bridges, nuclear plants, massive industrial infrastructures) under earthquakes and beyond. Surprisingly, even for low-dimensional systems, the modeling of dry friction in the presence of random forcing has not been elucidated. In this paper, we propose a piecewise deterministic Markov process approach modeling a system with dry friction including different coefficients for the static and dynamic forces. In this mathematical framework, we derive the corresponding Kolmogorov equations to compute statistical quantities of interest related to the distributions of the static (sticked) and dynamic phases. We show ergodicity and provide a representation formula of the stationary measure using independent identically distributed portions of the trajectory (excursions). We also obtain deterministic characterizations of the Laplace transforms of the probability density functions of the durations of the static and dynamic phases. In particular, the analysis of the power spectral density of the velocity reveals a critical value of the noise correlation time below which the correlations of the dynamic behaviors coincide with those of the white noise limit. The existence of such a critical value was already mentioned in the physical literature [Geffert and Just, Phys. Rev. E, 95 (2017), 062111].",

We study a system of nonidentical bistable particles that is driven by a dynamical constraint and coupled through a nonlocal mean-field. Assuming piecewise affine constitutive laws we prove the existence of traveling wave solutions and characterize their dynamical stability.

We develop a new Markov chain on graph partitions that makes relatively global moves yet is computationally feasible to be used as the proposal in the Metropolis–Hastings method. Our resulting algorithm is able to sample from a specified measure on partitions or spanning forests. Being able to sample from a specified measure is a requirement of what we consider as the gold standard in quantifying the extent to which a particular map is a gerrymander. Our proposal chain modifies the recently developed method called recombination (ReCom), which draws spanning trees on joined partitions and then randomly cuts them to repartition. We improve the computational efficiency by augmenting the statespace from partitions to spanning forests. The extra information accelerates the computation of the forward and backward proposal probabilities which are required for the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. We demonstrate this method by sampling redistricting plans on several measures of interest and find promising convergence results on several key observables of interest. We also explore some limitations in the measures that are efficient to sample from and investigate the feasibility of using parallel tempering to extend this space of measures.",

This paper studies the phase-only reconstruction problem of recovering a complex-valued signal [math] in [math] from the phase of [math] where [math] is a given measurement matrix in [math]. The reconstruction, if possible, should be up to a positive scaling factor. By using the rank of discriminant matrices, uniqueness conditions are derived to characterize whether the underlying signal can be uniquely reconstructed. We are also interested in the problem of minimal measurement number. We show that at least [math] but no more than [math] measurements are needed for the reconstruction of all [math], whereas the minimal measurement number is exactly [math] if we pursue the recovery of almost all signals. Moreover, when adapted to the phase-only reconstruction of [math], our uniqueness conditions are more practical and general than existing ones. Our theoretical results can be straightforwardly extended to affine phase-only reconstruction where the phase of [math] is observed for some [math].",
