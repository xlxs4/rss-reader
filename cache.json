          "description": "Abstract\nWe propose two spatial second-order schemes for linear radiative transfer equations by using the idea of the unified gas kinetic scheme (UGKS) to construct the numerical boundary fluxes, and show that the proposed schemes are both positive and asymptotic preserving. The UGKS was proposed by Xu and Huang (J Comput Phys 229:7747–7764, 2010) for continuum and rarefied flows firstly, and was then applied to a linear radiative transfer equation by Mieussens in (J Comput Phys 253:138–156, 2013) where the asymptotic preserving property of UGKS is shown. Although it is asymptotic preserving, UGKS can not always keep the positivity of solutions. We first apply UGKS to discretize a linear radiative transfer equation to have a spatial second-order scheme. Then, by a detailed analysis of the numerical boundary fluxes, we are able to find the reasons why the positive preserving property of UGKS fails. Finally, we carefully employ a linear scaling limiter and a flux correction to make UGKS positive-preserving but still asymptotic-preserving. Consequently, we propose two spatial second-order positive and asymptotic preserving unified gas kinetic schemes for the linear radiative transfer equation, thus improving the earlier work (J Comput Phys 444:110546, 2021) where only a first-order positive and asymptotic scheme is developed. The proposed schemes can well capture the solution of the diffusion limit equation in optically thick regions without requiring the cell size being smaller than the photon’s mean free path, while the solution in optically thin regions can also be well resolved in a natural way. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that a spatial second-order positive and asymptotic preserving gas kinetic scheme for linear radiative transfer equations is constructed. Several numerical experiments are included to validate the spatial second-order accuracy, positive- and asymptotic-preserving properties of the proposed schemes.",

          "description": "Abstract\nLinear inverse problems arise in diverse engineering fields especially in signal and image reconstruction. The development of computational methods for linear inverse problems with sparsity is one of the recent trends in this field. The so-called optimal k-thresholding is a newly introduced method for sparse optimization and linear inverse problems. Compared to other sparsity-aware algorithms, the advantage of optimal k-thresholding method lies in that it performs thresholding and error metric reduction simultaneously and thus works stably and robustly for solving medium-sized linear inverse problems. However, the runtime of this method is generally high when the size of the problem is large. The purpose of this paper is to propose an acceleration strategy for this method. Specifically, we propose a heavy-ball-based optimal k-thresholding algorithm and its relaxed variants for sparse linear inverse problems. The convergence of these algorithms is shown under the restricted isometry property. In addition, the numerical performance of the heavy-ball-based relaxed optimal k-thresholding pursuit (HBROTP) has been evaluated, and simulations indicate that HBROTP admits robustness for signal and image reconstruction even in noisy environments.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a new class of spectral volume (SV) methods are proposed, analyzed, and implemented for diffusion equations, with the viscous flux taken as an interior penalty or direct discontinuous Galerkin formulation. The control volumes are constructed by using four kinds of special points (including Legendre–Gauss, Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto, right Legendre–Gauss–Radau and left Legendre–Gauss–Radau points) in subintervals of the underlying meshes, which leads to four different SV schemes. A framework for the stability analysis and error estimates of the four SV schemes is established. In particular, the influence of the choice of the parameters in the numerical fluxes on the convergence rate and the optimal choices of coefficients for each SV scheme are discussed and provided. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the four SV schemes for both linear and nonlinear diffusion equations.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we concentrate on the robust tensor completion (RTC) problem, which aims to recover a low-rank tensor from partial observations corrupted by sparse noise. Most existing methods for RTC utilize the tensor nuclear norm (TNN) to evaluate the tensor rank. However, the TNN often yields biased solutions due to its loose approximation for the tensor rank. To solve this problem, we derive a unified non-convex surrogate that better approximates the tensor rank. Our surrogate is composed of several non-convex penalty functions. Further, we propose a generalized non-convex model, which minimizes a weighted combination of the unified non-convex surrogate and the \n                      \n                      \\(\\ell _1\\)\n                      \n                    -norm data fidelity term.

The method is based on discretization-corrected particle strength exchange (DC-PSE), which generalizes finite difference methods to meshfree point clouds. The proposed Surface DC-PSE method is derived from an embedding theorem, but we analytically reduce the operator kernels along surface normals to obtain a purely intrinsic computational scheme over surface point clouds. We benchmark Surface DC-PSE by discretizing the Laplace–Beltrami operator on a circle and a sphere, and we present convergence results for both explicit and implicit solvers. We then showcase the algorithm on the problem of computing Gauss and mean curvature of an ellipsoid and of the Stanford Bunny by approximating the intrinsic divergence of the normal vector field. Finally, we compare Surface DC-PSE with surface finite elements (SFEM) and diffuse-interface finite elements (DI FEM) in a validation case.",

We show that the proposed model verifies a dissipative energy balance. A well-balanced numerical scheme is proposed to solve the equations based on a projection method and a hydrostatic reconstruction for the Coulomb friction terms. In order to reduce the computational cost associated with solving the linear system of the projection method, a precomputing of the initial guess for an iterative solver is proposed. This strategy allows us to reduce the computational time by around 70\n                      \n                      \\(\\%\\)\n                      \n                     when 20 layers are considered.

During the initial stage of granular collapse simulations, the model is shown to improve the approximation of the mass profiles compared to other models and to predict the parabolic shape of the front velocity evolution with time, as observed in lab experiments. Interestingly, our numerical tests show that the ability of the granular flow to overcome obstacles strongly depends on the model used, which is of strong interest for landslide hazard assessment.",

It is shown that the Kaczmarz algorithm (KACZ) can simulate CD exactly, so CD can be accelerated by CG similarly to the CG acceleration of KACZ (Björck and Elfving in BIT 19:145–163, 1979). Experimental results were carried out on large sets of problems of reconstructing bandlimited functions from random sampling. The randomness causes extreme variance between different instances of these problems, thus causing extreme variance in the advantage of CGCD over CD. The reduction of the number of iterations by CGCD varies from about 50–90% and beyond. The implementation of CGCD is simple. CGCD can also be used for the parallel solution of linear systems derived from partial differential equations, and for the efficient solution of multiple right-hand-side problems and matrix inversion.",

The key idea is a novel combination of a nonlocal integral relaxation of the PDE problem with a robust meshfree discretization on point clouds.

A major theoretical contribution is the existence of consistent and positive stencils for a given point cloud geometry. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of positive stencils by finding neighbors within an ellipse (2d) or ellipsoid (3d) surrounding each interior point, generalizing the study for Poisson’s equation by Seibold (Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 198(3–4):592–601, 2008). It is well-known that wide stencils are in general needed for constructing consistent and monotone finite difference schemes for linear elliptic equations. Our result represents a significant improvement in the stencil width estimate for positive-type finite difference methods for linear elliptic equations in the near-degenerate regime (when the ellipticity constant becomes small), compared to previously known works in this area. Numerical algorithms and practical guidance are provided with an eye on the case of small ellipticity constant. At the end, we present numerical results for the performance of our method in both 2d and 3d, examining a range of ellipticity constants including the near-degenerate regime.",

In order to improve the computational robustness under large density ratios, a nonlinear weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) limiter and a positivity-preserving limiter are specially designed and applied with the aim of dampening the nonphysical oscillations around the phase interface and preventing the occurrence of negative density, respectively. More importantly, we theoretically prove that the present method is able to satisfy the uniform-pressure–velocity criterion which states that uniform pressure and velocity profiles around an isolated phase interface should be preserved during the simulation. The performance of the present method is validated by a range of benchmark test cases with density ratios up to 1000:1.

The present scheme is constructed by applying the hybrid HWENO method based on the zero- and first-order moment with DDG flux to discrete the diffusion term in spatial direction and the third-order TVD Runge–Kutta method in temporal direction. A troubled-cell indicator is first used to identify the cells in which the discontinuity may exist, then the first-order moment in the troubled-cell is reconstructed by fifth-order HWENO scheme. To avoid spurious oscillation, the HWENO reconstruction is performed when the reconstruction stencils contain troubled-cell, otherwise linear reconstruction is performed straightforwardly. Compared with WENO schemes, the present scheme has advantages: (1) compactness, only immediate neighbor cells are used in the reconstruction procedure; (2) accuracy, the numerical errors by the present scheme are smaller than those by WENO schemes. Some benchmarks for one- and two-dimensional parabolic equations to demonstrate the high order accuracy and non-oscillatory performance of the present scheme.",
