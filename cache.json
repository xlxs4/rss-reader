          "description": "Abstract\nUse of machine learning (ML) to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) is a growing area of research. In this work we apply ML to accelerate a numerical discretization scheme: the radial basis function time domain (RBF-TD) method. The RBF-TD method uses scattered nodes in both space and time to time-step PDEs. Here we investigate replacing a costly L1 minimization step in the original RBF-TD method with an ensemble ML model known as an extremely randomized trees regressor (ERT). We show that an ERT model trained on a simple PDE can maintain the high order accuracy of the original method with often significant speed up, while generalizing to a variety of convection-dominated PDEs. Through this work, we also extend the RBF-TD method to problems in 2-D space plus time. This study illustrates a novel opportunity to use ML to augment finite difference-related approximations while maintaining high order convergence under node refinement.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThis work addresses model order reduction for complex moving fronts, which are transported by advection or through a reaction–diffusion process. Such systems are especially challenging for model order reduction since the transport cannot be captured by linear reduction methods. Moreover, topological changes, such as splitting or merging of fronts pose difficulties for many nonlinear reduction methods and the small non-vanishing support of the underlying partial differential equations dynamics makes most nonlinear hyper-reduction methods infeasible. We propose a new decomposition method together with a hyper-reduction scheme that addresses these shortcomings. The decomposition uses a level-set function to parameterize the transport and a nonlinear activation function that captures the structure of the front. This approach is similar to autoencoder artificial neural networks, but additionally provides insights into the system, which can be used for efficient reduced order models. In addition to the presented decomposition method, we outline a tailored hyper-reduction method that is based on the reduced integration domain method. The capability of the approach is illustrated by various numerical examples in one and two spatial dimensions, including an advection–reaction–diffusion system with a Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov reaction term and real life application to a two-dimensional Bunsen flame.",

          "description": "Abstract\nStokes flow equations have been implemented successfully in practice for simulating problems with moving interfaces. Though computational methods based on the well-known MAC scheme produce accurate solutions and numerical convergence can be demonstrated using a resolution study, the rigorous convergence proofs are usually limited to particular reformulations and boundary conditions. In this paper, a rigorous error analysis of the marker and cell scheme for Stokes interface problems with constant viscosity in the framework of the finite difference method is presented. Without reformulating the problem into elliptic PDEs, the main idea is to use a discrete Ladyzenskaja-Babuska-Brezzi condition and construct auxiliary functions, which satisfy discretized Stokes equations and possess at least second order accuracy in the neighborhood of the moving interface. In particular, the method, for the first time, enables one to prove second order convergence of the velocity gradient in the discrete \n                      \n                      \\(\\ell ^2\\)\n                      \n                    -norm, in addition to the velocity and pressure fields.

          "description": "Abstract\nApproximate multidimensional Riemann solvers are essential building blocks in designing globally constraint-preserving finite volume time domain and discontinuous Galerkin time domain schemes for computational electrodynamics (CED). In those schemes, we can achieve high-order temporal accuracy with the help of Runge–Kutta or ADER time-stepping. This paper presents the design of a multidimensional approximate generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solver for the first time. The multidimensional Riemann solver accepts as its inputs the four states surrounding an edge on a structured mesh, and its output consists of a resolved state and its associated fluxes. In contrast, the multidimensional GRP solver accepts as its inputs the four states and their gradients in all directions; its output consists of the resolved state and its corresponding fluxes and the gradients of the resolved state. The gradients can then be used to extend the solution in time. As a result, we achieve second-order temporal accuracy in a single step. In this work, the formulation is optimized for linear hyperbolic systems with stiff, linear source terms because such a formulation will find maximal use in CED. Our formulation produces an overall constraint-preserving time-stepping strategy based on the GRP that is provably L-stable in the presence of stiff source terms. We present several stringent test problems, showing that the multidimensional GRP solver for CED meets its design accuracy and performs stably with optimal time steps. The test problems include cases with high conductivity, showing that the beneficial L-stability is indeed realized in practical applications.",

The use of a structured grid makes this approach not feasible for high-dimensional problems due to the curse of dimensionality. Here, we present a new approach for infinite horizon optimal control problems where the value function is computed using radial basis functions by the Shepard moving least squares approximation method on scattered grids. We propose a new method to generate a scattered mesh driven by the dynamics and the selection of the shape parameter in the RBF using an optimization routine. This mesh will help to localize the problem and approximate the dynamic programming principle in high dimension. Error estimates for the value function are also provided.

We introduce a multistep scheme for reconstructing multiscale sources from multifrequency sparse electric far field patterns. The unknown source is a combination of electric dipoles, magnetic dipoles and extended sources. The dipoles are shown to be uniquely identified by the multifrequency electric far field patterns at properly chosen sparse observation directions. Motivated by the constructive uniqueness, two indicator functions are then designed for locating the magnetic dipoles and the electric dipoles. After locating all the dipoles, the formulas for computing the corresponding polarization strengths are proposed. The stability of the formulas with respect to the frequency band is also derived. Finally, an indicator for the support of the extended sources is introduced once the dipoles are identified. Some numerical examples are presented to show the validity and robustness of the proposed algorithm.",

In this paper we present and analyze a constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method for convection diffusion equations. To define the multiscale basis functions, we first build an auxiliary multiscale space by solving local spectral problems motivated by analysis. Then a constraint energy minimization performed in the oversampling domains is exploited to construct the multiscale space. The resulting multiscale basis functions have a good decay property even for high contrast diffusion and convection coefficients. Furthermore, if the number of oversampling layers is chosen properly, we can prove that the convergence rate is proportional to the coarse meshsize. Our analysis also indicates that the size of the oversampling domain weakly depends on the contrast of the heterogeneous coefficients.

We propose a neural network-based approach to the homogenization of multiscale problems.

Compared with other network-based approaches for multiscale problems, the proposed method is free from the design of hand-crafted neural network architecture and the cell problem to calculate the homogenization coefficient. The exploration neighborhood of the Brownian walkers affects the overall learning trajectory. We determine the bounds of micro- and macro-time steps that capture the local heterogeneous and global homogeneous solution behaviors, respectively, through a neural network. The bounds imply that the computational cost of the proposed method is independent of the microscale periodic structure for the standard periodic problems.

The scaling of the mobility of two-dimensional Langevin dynamics in a periodic potential as the friction vanishes is not well understood for nonseparable potentials. Theoretical results are lacking, and numerical calculation of the mobility in the underdamped regime is challenging because the computational cost of standard Monte Carlo methods is inversely proportional to the friction coefficient, while deterministic methods are ill-conditioned. In this work, we propose a new variance-reduction method based on control variates for efficiently estimating the mobility of Langevin-type dynamics. We provide bounds on the bias and variance of the proposed estimator and illustrate its efficacy through numerical experiments, first in simple one-dimensional settings and then for two-dimensional Langevin dynamics. Our results corroborate prior numerical evidence that the mobility scales as [math], with [math], in the low friction regime for a simple nonseparable potential.",

The synchronization stability of a complex network system of coupled phase oscillators is discussed. In case the network is affected by disturbances, a stochastic linearized system of the coupled phase oscillators may be used to determine the fluctuations of phase differences in the lines between the nodes and to identify the vulnerable lines that may lead to desynchronization. The main result is the derivation of the asymptotic variance matrices of the phase differences which characterizes the severity of the fluctuations. It is found that the cycle space of the graph of the system plays a role in this characterization. With theory of the cycle space, the effect of forming small cycles on the fluctuations is evaluated. It is proven that adding a new line or increasing the coupling strength of a line affects the fluctuations in the lines in any cycle including this line, while it does not affect the fluctuations in the other lines. In particular, if the phase differences at the synchronous state are not changed by these actions, then the affected fluctuations reduce.",

Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most debilitating symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease and is associated with falls and loss of independence. The patho-physiological mechanisms underpinning FOG are currently poorly understood. In this paper we combine time series analysis and mathematical modeling to study the FOG phenomenon’s dynamics. We focus on the transition from stepping in place into freezing and treat this phenomenon in the context of an escape from an oscillatory attractor into an equilibrium attractor state. We extract a discrete-time discrete-space Markov chain from experimental data and divide its state space into communicating classes to identify the transition into freezing. This allows us to develop a methodology for computationally estimating the time to freezing as well as the phase along the oscillatory (stepping) cycle of a patient experiencing Freezing Episodes (FE). The developed methodology is general and could be applied to any time series featuring transitions between different dynamic regimes including time series data from forward walking in people with FOG.",

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), also known as the circadian master clock, consists of a large population of oscillator neurons. Together, these neurons produce a coherent signal that drives the body’s circadian rhythms. What properties of the cell-to-cell communication allow the synchronization of these neurons, despite a wide range of environmental challenges such as fluctuations in photoperiods? To answer that question, we present a mean-field description of globally coupled neurons modeled as Goodwin oscillators with standard Gaussian noise. Provided that the initial conditions of all neurons are independent and identically distributed, any finite number of neurons becomes independent and has the same probability distribution in the mean-field limit, a phenomenon called propagation of chaos. This probability distribution is a solution to a Vlasov–Fokker–Planck type equation, which can be obtained from the stochastic particle model. We study, using the macroscopic description, how the interaction between external noise and intercellular coupling affects the dynamics of the collective rhythm, and we provide a numerical description of the bifurcations resulting from the noise-induced transitions. Our numerical simulations show a noise-induced rhythm generation at low noise intensities, while the SCN clock is arrhythmic in the high noise setting. Notably, coupling induces resonance-like behavior at low noise intensities, and varying coupling strength can cause period locking and variance dissipation even in the presence of noise.",

Kuramoto networks constitute a paradigmatic model for the investigation of collective behavior in networked systems. Despite many advances in recent years, many open questions remain on the solutions for systems composed of coupled Kuramoto oscillators on complex networks. In this article, we describe an algebraic method to find equilibria in this kind of system without approximation. To do this, we use a recently introduced algebraic approach to the Kuramoto dynamics, which results in an explicitly solvable complex-valued equation that captures the dynamics of the original Kuramoto model. Using this new approach, we obtain equilibria for both the nonlinear original Kuramoto and complex-valued systems considering the case of homogeneous natural frequency. We then completely classify all equilibria in the case of complete graphs originally studied by Kuramoto. Finally, we study equilibria in networks of coupled oscillators with phase-lag in generalized circulant networks, multilayer networks, and also random networks.",

In this work, we use ideas from validated numerics in order to obtain rigorous a posteriori error estimates together with existence results about gPC expansions of random invariant sets. This approach also provides a new framework for conducting validated continuation, i.e., for rigorously computing isolated branches of solutions in parameter-dependent systems, which generalizes in a straightforward way to multiparameter continuation.

In this paper, we take the Rosenzweig–MacArthur (RM) model with generalist predator as an example in a constant or changing environment. When the environment is fixed, we provide a more easily verifiable classification, in terms of the coefficients of the system with nilpotent linear part and general higher terms, to determine the types and codimension of nilpotent singularities in a general planar system. Second, by using the existing classification and some algebraic methods, we show that the highest codimension of a nilpotent focus is 4 and the sample RM model with generalist predator can exhibit nilpotent focus bifurcation of codimension 4. Our results indicate that generalist predation can cause not only richer bifurcations and dynamics (such as multitype tristability and quadristability, a figure-eight loop) but also the possible extirpation of prey. When the environment is changing, we study the impact of the rate [math] and intensity [math] of a nonlinear environmental change on dynamics. The key observations on the asymptotic and transient dynamics include (i) transient tracking on unstable steady states or oscillations, and transient-related regime shifts; (ii) slow and fast regime shifts; (iii) regulation of transient dynamics by the environmental change parameters [math] and [math]; (iv) slow negative or fast positive environmental change can delay or even avoid population extirpation.",

We study the dynamics of unsaturated flows within a fluid-infused wet patch in a thin porous layer, coupled with the transport of passive particles, partly inspired by some art practice and environmental and industrial activities. The role of wetting and capillary forces and the influence of evaporation are both emphasized. Two coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) are first derived to describe the time evolution of the fluid saturation and concentration of passive particles. Three dimensionless parameters are identified after appropriate nondimensionalization of the coupled PDEs, the influence of which is demonstrated through asymptotic and numerical solutions at both the early and late times. With evaporation, in particular, the fluid front first arrives at a maximum location after an initial period of spreading. Thereafter, the front starts to recede until the fluid drains out at a finite time. Correspondingly, the concentration of particles blows up at a finite time, when the size of the wet region shrinks to zero. Meanwhile, the spatial distribution of particles evolves towards a universal curve near the front at late times, as the particles gradually accumulate at the front of the wet patch. It is recognized that, while the spreading of fluid within a porous layer behaves similar to that of a viscous gravity current subject to volume loss, the frontal structure for the concentration of particles, to some extent, is similar to that of an intruding inviscid gravity current.",

To do this, we define the phase by precisely projecting the infinite-dimensional system onto the manifold of isometries. We outline a precise stochastic differential equation for the phase.

We consider an agro-ecologically motivated coupling between a prey-predator system and a vector-borne epidemic system. The coupled system contains one ODE, two reaction-diffusion PDEs, and one reaction-diffusion–advection PDE; it has no complete variational or monotonic structure and coefficients are spatially heterogeneous. We study the long-time behavior of solutions of the Cauchy–Neumann problem, which turns out to be largely decided by a linear stability criterion but still involves nonlinear subtleties.

We analyse the dynamics of different routes to collapse of a constrained polyelectrolyte gel in contact with an ionic bath. The evolution of the gel is described by a model that incorporates non-linear elasticity, Stefan–Maxwell diffusion and interfacial gradient free energy to account for phase separation of the gel. A bifurcation analysis of the homogeneous equilibrium states reveals three solution branches at low ion concentrations in the bath, giving way to only one above a critical ion concentration. We present numerical solutions that capture both the spatial heterogeneity and the multiple timescales involved in the process of collapse. These solutions are complemented by two analytical studies. Firstly, a phase-plane analysis that reveals the existence of a depletion front for the transition from the highly swollen to the new collapsed equilibrium state. This depletion front is initiated after the fast ionic diffusion has set the initial condition for this time regime. Secondly, we perform a linear stability analysis about the homogeneous states that show that for a range of ion concentrations in the bath, spinodal decomposition of the swollen state gives rise to localized solvent-rich(poor) and, due to the electroneutrality condition, ion-poor(rich) phases that coarsen on the route to collapse. This dynamics of a collapsing polyelectrolyte gel has not been described before.",

We provide an optimal control framework for efficiently coupling light in a bare fiber into Bragg gratings with cubic nonlinearity. The light-grating interaction excites gap solitons, a type of localized nonlinear coherent state which propagates with a central frequency in the forbidden band gap, resulting in a dramatically slower group velocity. Due to the nature of the band gap, a substantial amount of light is back-reflected by the grating’s strong reflective properties. We optimize, via a projected gradient descent method, the transmission efficiency of previously designed nonuniform grating structures in order to couple more slow light into the grating. We further explore the space of possible grating designs, using genetic algorithms, along with a previously unexplored design parameter: the grating chirp. Through these methods, we find structures that couple a greater fraction of light into the grating with the added bonus of creating slower pulses.",

Malaria is one of the deadliest infectious diseases globally, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. It disproportionately affects young children, with two-thirds of fatalities occurring in under-fives. Individuals acquire protection from disease through repeated exposure, and this immunity plays a crucial role in the dynamics of malaria spread. We develop a novel age-structured PDE malaria model, which couples vector-host epidemiological dynamics with immunity dynamics. Our model tracks the acquisition and loss of antidisease immunity during transmission and its corresponding nonlinear feedback onto the transmission parameters. We derive the basic reproduction number ([math]) as the threshold condition for the stability of disease-free equilibrium; we also interpret [math] probabilistically as a weighted sum of cases generated by infected individuals at different infectious stages and different ages. We parametrize our model using demographic and immunological data from sub-Saharan regions. Numerical bifurcation analysis demonstrates the existence of an endemic equilibrium, and we observe a forward bifurcation in [math]. Our numerical simulations reproduce the heterogeneity in the age distributions of immunity profiles and infection status created by frequent exposure. Motivated by the recently approved RTS,S vaccine, we also study the impact of vaccination; our results show a reduction in severe disease among young children but a small increase in severe malaria among older children due to lower acquired immunity from delayed exposure.",

We introduce the first two-way coupled model for the thermo-viscous damping of a mechanical structure (such as quartz tuning fork) that is forced by the weak acoustic and thermal waves generated when a laser source periodically interacts with a trace gas. The model is based on a Helmholtz system of thermo-visco-acoustic equations in the fluid, together with a system of equations for the temperature and the displacement of the structure. These two subsystems are coupled across the fluid-structure interface via several conditions. With this model, the user specifies the geometry of the structure and the viscous and thermal parameters of the fluid, and the model outputs an effective damping parameter and a signal strength that is proportional to the concentration of the trace gas. This new model is a significant improvement over existing one-way coupled models in which damping effects are incorporated via a priori laboratory measurements. Analytical solutions derived for an annular structure show reasonable agreement between the one-way and two-way coupled models at higher ambient pressures. However, at low ambient pressure the one-way coupled model does not adequately capture thermo-viscous effects.",

Long-term behaviors of biochemical systems are described by steady states in deterministic models and stationary distributions in stochastic models. Obtaining their analytic solutions can be done for limited cases, such as linear or finite-state systems, as it generally requires solving many coupled equations. Interestingly, analytic solutions can be easily obtained when underlying networks have special topologies, called weak reversibility (WR) and zero deficiency (ZD), and the kinetic law follows a generalized form of mass-action kinetics. However, such desired topological conditions do not hold for the majority of cases. Thus, translating networks to have WR and ZD while preserving the original dynamics was proposed. Yet, this approach is limited because manually obtaining the desired network translation among the large number of candidates is challenging. Here, we prove necessary conditions for having WR and ZD after translation, and based on these conditions, we develop a user-friendly computational package, TOWARDZ, that automatically and efficiently identifies translated networks with WR and ZD. This allows us to quantitatively examine how likely it is to obtain WR and ZD after translation depending on the number of species and reactions. Importantly, we also describe how our package can be used to analytically derive steady states of deterministic models and stationary distributions of stochastic models. TOWARDZ provides an effective tool to analyze biochemical systems.",
