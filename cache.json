          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a Quadrature by Two Expansions (QB2X) numerical integration technique is developed for the single and double layer potentials of the Helmholtz equation in two dimensions. The QB2X method uses both local complex Taylor expansions and plane wave type expansions to achieve a resulting representation which is numerically accurate for all target points inside a leaf box in the fast multipole method (FMM) hierarchical tree structure. The QB2X method explicitly includes nonlinear dependency of the boundary geometry in the plane wave expansions, thereby providing for higher-order representations of both the boundary geometry and density functions in the integrand, with its convergence following standard FMM error analysis. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the QB2X method for Helmholtz layer potentials using one expansion center for the entire FMM-leaf box for both flat and curved boundaries with various densities.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe develop flux globalization based well-balanced central-upwind schemes for hydrodynamic equations with general free energy. The proposed schemes are well-balanced in the sense that they are capable of exactly preserving quite complicated steady-state solutions and also exactly capturing traveling waves, even when vacuum regions are present. In order to accurately track interfaces of the vacuum regions and near vacuum parts of the solution, we use the technique introduced in Chertock et al. (J Sci Comput 90:Paper No. 9, 2022) and design a hybrid approach: inside the no vacuum regions, we use the flux globalization based well-balanced central-upwind scheme, while elsewhere we implement the central-upwind scheme similar to the one proposed in Bollermann et al. (J Sci Comput 56:267–290, 2013) in the context of wet/dry fronts in the shallow water equations. The advantages of the proposed schemes are demonstrated on a number of challenging numerical examples.",

These methods allow the use of standard finite elements for the solution of the problem while simultaneously removing a spurious pressure influence in the approximation error of the velocity of the fluid, or the displacement of an incompressible solid. To this end, reconstruction operators are utilized mapping discretely divergence free functions to divergence free functions. This work shows that the modifications proposed for Stokes equation by Linke (Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 268:782–800, 2014) also yield gradient robust methods for nearly incompressible elastic materials without the need to resort to discontinuous finite elements methods as proposed in Fu et al. (J Sci Comput 86(3):39–30, 2021).",

Two common governing equations are considered: reactive Euler equations and Navier–Stokes equations. Based on our recently developed high-order bound-preserving discontinuous Galerkin method in Du and Yang (J Comput Phys 469:111548, 2022), we add an extra damping term into this scheme to control the spurious oscillations. With the careful construction of the damping term, the proposed method not only achieves non-oscillatory property without sacrificing any order of accuracy but also preserves the conservative property which is the key ingredient of the bound-preserving technique developed in Du and Yang (2022). Therefore, the proposed OFDG method is well-compatible with the bound-preserving limiter in Du and Yang (2022). Similar to Liu et al. (SIAM J Sci Comput 44:A230–A259, 2022), the conservative modified exponential Runge–Kutta method is used to relax the restriction of time step sizes and preserve the conservative property of the fully discrete schemes.

Our methods are based on the physically correct viscous stress tensor of the fluid, involving the symmetric gradient of velocity (rather than the gradient), provide exactly divergence-free discrete velocity solutions, and optimal error estimates that are also pressure robust. We explain how the methods are constructed using the minimal number of coupling degrees of freedom per facet.

          "description": "Abstract\nHermite interpolation is classically used to reconstruct smooth data when the function and its first order derivatives are available at certain nodes. If first order derivatives are not available, it is easy to set a system of equations imposing some regularity conditions at the data nodes in order to obtain them. This process leads to the construction of a Hermite spline. The problem of the described Hermite splines is that the accuracy is lost if the data contains singularities. The consequence is the appearance of oscillations, if there is a jump discontinuity in the function, that globally affects the accuracy of the spline, or the smearing of singularities, if the discontinuities are in the derivatives of the function. This paper is devoted to the construction and analysis of a new technique that allows for the computation of accurate first order derivatives of a function close to singularities using a Hermite spline. The idea is to correct the system of equations of the spline in order to attain the desired accuracy even close to the singularities. Once we have computed the first order derivatives with enough accuracy, a correction term is added to the Hermite spline in the intervals that contain a singularity. The aim is to reconstruct piecewise smooth functions with \n                      \n                      \\(O(h^4)\\)\n                      \n                     accuracy even close to the singularities. The process of adaption will require some knowledge about the position of the singularity and the jumps of the function and some of its derivatives at the singularity. The whole process can be used as a post-processing, where a correction term is added to the classical cubic Hermite spline. Proofs for the accuracy and regularity of the corrected spline and its derivatives are given. We also analyse the mechanism that eliminates the Gibbs phenomenon close to jump discontinuities in the function. The numerical experiments presented confirm the theoretical results obtained.",

          "description": "Abstract\nDue to its significance in terms of wave phenomena a considerable effort has been put into the design of preconditioners for the Helmholtz equation. One option to design a preconditioner is to apply a multigrid method on a shifted operator. In such an approach, the wavenumber is shifted by some imaginary value. This step is motivated by the observation that the shifted problem can be more efficiently handled by iterative solvers when compared to the standard Helmholtz equation. However, up to now, it is not obvious what the best strategy for the choice of the shift parameter is. It is well known that a good shift parameter depends sensitively on the wavenumber and the discretization parameters such as the order and the mesh size. Therefore, we study the choice of a near optimal complex shift such that a flexible generalized minimal residual (FGMRES) solver converges with fewer iterations. Our goal is to provide a map which returns the near optimal shift for the preconditioner depending on the wavenumber and the mesh size. In order to compute this map, a data driven approach is considered: We first generate many samples, and in a second step, we perform a nonlinear regression on this data. With this representative map, the near optimal shift can be obtained by a simple evaluation. Our preconditioner is based on a twogrid V-cycle applied to the shifted problem, allowing us to implement a semi matrix-free method in which only the coarse grid and boundary matrices need to be stored in memory. On the fine grid, only the action of the matrix applied to a vector is computed, without assembling the global matrix. This enables efficient use of computing resources and allows problems to be solved at scales that were previously limited by the available memory. The performance of our preconditioned FGMRES solver is illustrated by several benchmark problems with heterogeneous wavenumbers in two and three space dimensions.",

We analyze the mathematical model that describes the heat generated by electromagnetic nanoparticles. We use the known optical properties of the nanoparticles to control the support and amount of the heat needed around a nanoparticle. Precisely, we show that the dominant part of the heat around the nanoparticle is the electric field multiplied by a constant which is explicitly and solely dependent on the permittivity and quantities related to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the magnetization (or the Newtonian) operator, defined on the nanoparticle, and inversely proportional to the distance to the nanoparticle. The nanoparticles are described via the Lorentz model. If the used incident frequency is chosen related to the plasmonic frequency [math] (via the magnetization operator), then the nanoparticle behaves as a plasmonic one; if it is chosen related to the undamped resonance frequency [math] (via the Newtonian operator), then it behaves as a dielectric one. The two regimes exhibit different optical behaviors. In both cases, we estimate the generated heat and discuss advantages of each incident frequency regime. The analysis is based on time-domain integral equation techniques, avoiding the use of (formal) Fourier type transformations.",

          "description": "Multiscale Modeling & Simulation, Volume 21, Issue 2, Page 513-541, June 2023. \n Abstract. Numerical multiscale methods usually rely on some coupling between a macroscopic and a microscopic model. The macroscopic model is incomplete as effective quantities, such as the homogenized material coefficients or fluxes, are missing in the model. These effective data need to be computed by running local microscale simulations followed by a local averaging of the microscopic information. Motivated by the classical homogenization theory, it is a common practice to use local elliptic cell problems for computing the missing homogenized coefficients in the macro model. Such a consideration results in a first order error [math], where [math] represents the wavelength of the microscale variations and [math] is the size of the microscopic simulation boxes. This error, called “resonance error,” originates from the boundary conditions used in the microproblem and typically dominates all other errors in a multiscale numerical method. Optimal decay of the resonance error remains an open problem, although several interesting approaches reducing the effect of the boundary have been proposed over the last two decades. In this paper, as an attempt to resolve this problem, we propose a computationally efficient, fully elliptic approach with exponential decay of the resonance error.",

Because of the high dimensionality of reaction-diffusion systems on networks, exploration for the bifurcation properties of such systems has been far less thorough than their corresponding parabolic PDE systems. With the overcoming of this long-standing difficulty, we consider the steady state bifurcation for the general network-organized reaction-diffusion system and derive the algorithm of calculating the perturbation incorporated restricted system associated with the simple zero singularity, through seeking out the parameter dependent center manifolds belonging to the unique zero eigenvalue. Rigorous theoretical analysis for the third-order truncated restricted system shows that the complex underlying networks can trigger some bifurcation types differing from the usual supercritical and subcritical pitchfork bifurcations and so enrich the dynamical behaviors of reaction-diffusion process in networks. To illustrate the application for our obtained theoretical results, we conduct a strict steady state bifurcation analysis for a metapopulation epidemic system defined on four typical connected undirected underlying networks, and find that there exist some new multistability phenomena and hysteresis effects in the irregular small-word and scale-free lattice network.",

Kernel analog forecasting (KAF) is a methodology for data-driven, nonparametric forecasting of dynamically generated time series data. This approach has a rigorous foundation in Koopman operator theory and it produces good forecasts in practice, but it suffers from the heavy computational costs common to kernel methods. This paper proposes a streaming algorithm for KAF that only requires a single pass over the training data. This algorithm dramatically reduces the costs of training and prediction without sacrificing forecasting skill. Computational experiments demonstrate that the streaming KAF method can successfully forecast several classes of dynamical systems (periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic) in both data-scarce and data-rich regimes. The overall methodology may have wider interest as a new template for streaming kernel regression.",

Optimal packing is applied in physics for investigation of macroscopic properties of composites and porous media.

Such an optimal location is studied and compared to the pure geometric problem for [math] disks packing on the flat torus. The hexagonal (triangular) array of disks solves the problem for the triangle lattice numbers [math].

In this article, we study the problem of stabilizing the traffic flow on a ring road to a uniform steady-state using autonomous vehicles (AV). Traffic is represented at a microscopic level via a Bando-Follow-the-Leader model capable of reproducing phantom jams. For the single-lane case, a single AV can stabilize an arbitrary large ring road with an arbitrary large number of cars. Moreover, this stabilization is exponentially quick with a decay rate independent of the number of cars and a control gain also independent of the number of cars. On the other side, the stabilization domain and stabilization time depend on the number of cars. Two types of controller algorithms are proposed: a proportional control and a proportional-integral control. In both cases, the measurements used by the controller only depend on the local data around the AV, enabling an easy implementation. After numerical tests of the single-lane case, a multilane model is described using a safety-incentive mechanism for lane change. Numerical simulations for the multilane ring road suggest that the control strategy is also very efficient in such a setting, even with a single AV.",

The breaking of a detailed balance in fluids through Coriolis forces or odd-viscous stresses has profound effects on the dynamics of surface waves. Here we explore both weakly and strongly nonlinear waves in a three-dimensional fluid with vertical odd viscosity with and without the Coriolis effect. Our model describes the free surface of a shallow fluid composed of nearly vertical vortex filaments, which all stand perpendicular to the surface. We find that the odd viscosity in this configuration induces previously unexplored nonlinear effects in shallow-water waves, arising from both stresses on the surface and stress gradients in the bulk. By assuming weak nonlinearity, we find reduced equations including Korteweg–de Vries, Ostrovsky, and Kadomtsev–Petviashvilli equations with modified coefficients. At sufficiently large odd viscosity, the dispersion changes sign, allowing for compact two-dimensional solitary waves. We show that odd viscosity and surface tension have the same effect on the free surface, but distinct signatures in the fluid flow. Our results describe the collective dynamics of many-vortex systems, which can also occur in oceanic and atmospheric geophysics.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Volume 83, Issue 3, Page 966-984, June 2023. \n Abstract. A generalization of the Schwarz integral formula in the class of multiply connected circular domains is constructed. A classical Schwarz integral formula retrieves, up to an imaginary constant, an analytic function in a domain given its real part on the boundary of a domain; Poisson integral formulas are well-known examples for simply connected domains. The generalized integral formulas derived here retrieve an analytic function given more general linear combinations of its real and imaginary parts on each boundary component of a multiply connected domain. Those linear combinations can be different on each boundary component. The chief mathematical tool is the prime function of a multiply connected circular domain. A Schwarz integral formula for such domains, retrieving an analytic function given its real part on all boundary components, was derived in terms of the prime function by Crowdy [Complex Var. Elliptic Equ., 53 (2008), pp. 221–236]. The present paper combines those formulas with use of radial-slit conformal mappings, also expressible in terms of the prime function, to produce integral expressions for analytic functions where more general linear combinations of their real and imaginary parts are specified on the boundary components of a multiply connected domain. We refer to the resulting expressions as generalized Schwarz integral formulas. Their usefulness and versatility are showcased by application to three topical problems: finding the potential around periodic interdigitated electrodes, solving the free boundary problem for hollow vortex wakes behind a bluff body, and determining the two-phase flow over a so-called liquid-infused surface.",
