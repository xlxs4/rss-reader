          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose a unified primal-dual algorithm framework based on the augmented Lagrangian function for composite convex problems with conic inequality constraints. The new framework is highly versatile. First, it not only covers many existing algorithms such as PDHG, Chambolle–Pock, GDA, OGDA and linearized ALM, but also guides us to design a new efficient algorithm called Semi-OGDA (SOGDA). Second, it enables us to study the role of the augmented penalty term in the convergence analysis. Interestingly, a properly selected penalty not only improves the numerical performance of the above methods, but also theoretically enables the convergence of algorithms like PDHG and SOGDA. Under properly designed step sizes and penalty term, our unified framework preserves the \n                      \n                      \\({\\mathcal {O}}(1/N)\\)\n                      \n                     ergodic convergence while not requiring any prior knowledge about the magnitude of the optimal Lagrangian multiplier. Linear convergence rate for affine equality constrained problem is also obtained given appropriate conditions. Finally, numerical experiments on linear programming, \n                      \n                      \\(\\ell _1\\)\n                      \n                     minimization problem, and multi-block basis pursuit problem demonstrate the efficiency of our methods.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe develop a universally applicable embedded boundary finite difference method, which results in a symmetric positive definite linear system and does not suffer from small cell stiffness. Our discretization is efficient for the wave, heat and Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. When the system needs to be inverted we can use the conjugate gradient method, accelerated by algebraic multigrid techniques. A series of numerical tests for the wave, heat and Poisson equation and applications to shape optimization problems verify the accuracy, stability, and efficiency of our method. Our fast computational techniques can be extended to moving boundary problems (e.g. Stefan problem), to the Navier–Stokes equations, and to the Grad-Shafranov equations for which problems are posed on domains with complex geometry and fast simulations are of great interest.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe existing shift technique for quaternion matrix computation is to use real shifts rather than quaternion shifts, because quaternions are multiplicatively non-commutative in general. This becomes the obstacle to the development of fast and stable algorithms for computing partial quaternion eigenpairs. To overcome this difficulty, a new inverse quaternion iteration with quaternion shift is derived for solving general right quaternion eigenvalue problem. Fixed and updated quaternion shift techniques are developed to speed up the convergence. The advantage of quaternion shifts is explained geometrically, as well as the fact that real shifts may lead to wrong results. The convergence theory is built in a different way to that in real and complex cases. Numerical experiments on simulated data and color face database demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the newly proposed method over the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

These rules are used as weights in a linear combination of function evaluations to indicate the local behavior of the function itself. By analyzing the asymptotic properties of the rules, we introduce two indicators (one for discontinuities of the function and one for discontinuities of its gradient) by locally computing just one rule. This leads to an efficient and reliable scheme, which allows us to effectively detect and classify points close to discontinuities. We then show how this information can be suitably combined with adaptive approximation methods based on hierarchical spline spaces in the reconstruction process of surfaces with discontinuities. The considered adaptive methods exploit the ability of the hierarchical spaces to be locally refined, and fault detection is a natural way to guide the refinement with low computational cost. A selection of test cases is presented to show the effectiveness of our approach.",

First a new augmented singular transform is developed to form a barrier so that an algorithm search outside the subspace generated by previously found fixed points cannot pass the barrier and penetrate into the inside to reach an old fixed point. Thus a fixed point found by an algorithm must be new. Its mathematical validations are established. A flow chart of PNCM is presented. Then a more accurate Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto pseudospectral scheme is constructed and convertes a semi-linear fixed point problem into a linear partial differential equation and an algebraic equation.

However, the combination of non-linearity and stiffness may introduce time-step restrictions which could make explicit integration computationally infeasible. To overcome this problem, we develop a new class of implicit rank-adaptive algorithms for temporal integration of nonlinear evolution equations on tensor manifolds. These algorithms are based on performing one time step with a conventional time-stepping scheme, followed by an implicit fixed point iteration step involving a rank-adaptive truncation operation onto a tensor manifold. Implicit step truncation methods are straightforward to implement as they rely only on arithmetic operations between tensors, which can be performed by efficient and scalable parallel algorithms. Numerical applications demonstrating the effectiveness of implicit step-truncation tensor integrators are presented and discussed for the Allen–Cahn equation, the Fokker–Planck equation, and the nonlinear Schrödinger equation.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThanks to their universal approximation properties and new efficient training strategies, Deep Neural Networks are becoming a valuable tool for the approximation of mathematical operators. In the present work, we introduce Mesh-Informed Neural Networks (MINNs), a class of architectures specifically tailored to handle mesh based functional data, and thus of particular interest for reduced order modeling of parametrized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The driving idea behind MINNs is to embed hidden layers into discrete functional spaces of increasing complexity, obtained through a sequence of meshes defined over the underlying spatial domain. The approach leads to a natural pruning strategy which enables the design of sparse architectures that are able to learn general nonlinear operators. We assess this strategy through an extensive set of numerical experiments, ranging from nonlocal operators to nonlinear diffusion PDEs, where MINNs are compared against more traditional architectures, such as classical fully connected Deep Neural Networks, but also more recent ones, such as DeepONets and Fourier Neural Operators. Our results show that MINNs can handle functional data defined on general domains of any shape, while ensuring reduced training times, lower computational costs, and better generalization capabilities, thus making MINNs very well-suited for demanding applications such as Reduced Order Modeling and Uncertainty Quantification for PDEs.",

Each iteration of AS-PAL inexactly solves a possibly nonconvex proximal augmented Lagrangian (AL) subproblem obtained by an aggressive/adaptive choice of prox stepsize with the aim of substantially improving its computational performance followed by a full Lagrange multiplier update. A major advantage of AS-PAL compared to other AL methods is that it requires no knowledge of parameters (e.g., size of constraint matrix, objective function curvatures, etc) associated with the optimization problem, due to its adaptive nature not only in choosing the prox stepsize but also in using a crucial adaptive accelerated composite gradient variant to solve the proximal AL subproblems. The speed and efficiency of AS-PAL is demonstrated through extensive computational experiments showing that it can solve many instances more than ten times faster than other state-of-the-art penalty and AL methods, particularly when high accuracy is required.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a modified a posteriori limiter is developed for high order flux reconstruction (FR) scheme for the numerical simulation of detonation problems. In this limiting procedure, the unlimited FR solution at the new time step will be checked first by using some detection criteria, then the solution in the troubled cells are recomputed with a robust subcell finite volume (FV) scheme. The detection criteria for identifying troubled cells consist of the physical admissibility (e.g., positivity of density and pressure) and numerical admissibility (e.g., non-oscillating). We modify the detection criteria by using the KXRCF shock detector prior to the relaxed discrete maximum principle. This can track the troubled cells near strong shocks consecutively so as to improve the steady state convergence and can reduce the number of overly marked troubled cells. The subcell correction procedure endows the high order FR scheme the capability to capture discontinuities inside a cell without generating spurious oscillations. A series of one-dimensional numerical tests are carried out to assess the effectiveness of the proposed limiter. In particular, one-dimensional detonation wave problems with the overdriven factor f = 1.8–1.3 are calculated using third to sixth order accurate FR schemes in conjunction with the first order Godunov or second order TVD subcell FV scheme. It is shown that the FR schemes with the present a posteriori limiter can compute strong detonation waves robustly, and the third order FR scheme with the second order TVD subcell FV limiter has better resolution of detonation waves compared with the fifth order WENO-Z scheme under same degree of freedoms.",

Then the piecewise polynomial collocation method is adopted to solve the reformulated VIE, and based on the regularity of the original FDE, the convergence for the collocation method and the superconvergence for the iterated collocation method are investigated in detail, respectively. Further, based on the obtained collocation solution, the interpolation postprocessing approximation of higher accuracy is constructed on graded mesh, and the superconvergence is obtained. Compared with classical iterated collocation method, the cost on computation of interpolation postprocessing technique is less. Numerical experiments are given to illustrate the theoretical results, and it is also shown that the proposed postprocessing technique can be extended to certain nonlinear and systems of FDEs.",

Using classical potential theory, the Laplace–Beltrami operator can be pre-/post-conditioned with an integral operator whose kernel is translation invariant, resulting in well-conditioned Fredholm integral equations of the second-kind. These equations have the standard 1/r kernel from potential theory, and therefore the equations can be solved rapidly and accurately using a combination of fast multipole methods (FMMs) and high-order quadrature corrections. In this work we detail such a scheme, presenting two alternative integral formulations of the Laplace–Beltrami problem, each of whose solution can be obtained via FMM acceleration.

This paper concerns the derivation of radiative transfer equations for acoustic waves propagating in a randomly fluctuating half-space in the weak-scattering regime, and the study of boundary effects through an asymptotic analysis of the Wigner transform of the wave solution. These radiative transfer equations allow one to model the transport of wave energy density, taking into account the scattering by random heterogeneities. The approach builds on the method of images, where the half-space problem is extended to a full-space, with two symmetric sources and an even map of mechanical properties. Two contributions to the total energy density are then identified: one similar to the energy density propagation in a full-space, for which the resulting lack of statistical stationarity of the medium properties has no leading-order effect; and one supported within one wavelength of the boundary, which describes interference effects between the waves produced by the two symmetric sources. In the case of a homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, this boundary effect yields a doubling of the intensity, and in the case of homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, a canceling of that intensity.",

The boundary surface of each trap is taken to be a semipermeable membrane.

In this paper, a multiscale constitutive framework for one-dimensional blood flow modeling is presented and discussed. By analyzing the asymptotic limits of the proposed model, it is shown that different types of blood propagation phenomena in arteries and veins can be described through an appropriate choice of scaling parameters, which are related to distinct characterizations of the fluid-structure interaction mechanism (whether elastic or viscoelastic) that exist between vessel walls and blood flow. In these asymptotic limits, well-known blood flow models from the literature are recovered. Additionally, by analyzing the perturbation of the local elastic equilibrium of the system, a new viscoelastic blood flow model is derived. The proposed approach is highly flexible and suitable for studying the human cardiovascular system, which is composed of vessels with high morphological and mechanical variability. The resulting multiscale hyperbolic model of blood flow is solved using an asymptotic-preserving implicit-explicit Runge–Kutta finite volume method, which ensures the consistency of the numerical scheme with the different asymptotic limits of the mathematical model without affecting the choice of the time step by restrictions related to the smallness of the scaling parameters. Several numerical tests confirm the validity of the proposed methodology, including a case study investigating the hemodynamics of a thoracic aorta in the presence of a stent.",

We analyze the searching strategies of a forager diffusing in the whole space via an equation of fractional type. Specifically, the diffusion of the forager is regulated by a Lévy flight whose exponent can be chosen in order to optimize a suitable foraging efficiency functional. Here, the dimension of the space is arbitrary. On the one hand, we show that the exponent [math] corresponding to the limit case of heavy-tailed Lévy flights is a pessimizer for the efficiency functional. On the other hand, we prove that, in situations of biological interest, one finds the most rewarding strategies arbitrarily close to [math]. The combination of these results gives that the most rewarding searching option may turn out to be unfeasible, or at least unreliable, in practice, since small perturbations of the optimal searching exponent lead to pessimal patterns. The cases analyzed specifically are those of a target located in the proximity of the forager and that of sparse prey modeled by a target infinitely far from the initial position of the seeker. The efficiency functionals taken into account are either of pointwise type (in which the predator and the prey are modeled by moving points) or of set-dependent type (in which the predator and the prey correspond to regions of space with uniform density, thus modeling also the case of a sight range of the biological individuals involved). To implement our analysis, we also provide a number of structural results about finiteness, continuity, and asymptotic behaviors of the efficiency functionals. It is suggestive to relate the adoption of the most rewarding searching pattern close to pessimizers to a “high-risk/high-gain” strategy, in which the forager aims at high-energy content prey to mitigate the risk of failure. This setting is also connected to foraging modes of “ambush” type.",

We consider the inverse time-harmonic elastic source problems with multifrequency sparse far field patterns. The unknown multiscale object is a combination of point sources and an extended source with compact support. Even if the extended source is unknown, we prove that the locations and the polarization strengths of the point sources can be uniquely determined by the multifrequency far field patterns at sparse observations. The least number of observation directions is given in terms of the number of the point sources. Having identified the point sources, under certain conditions, we further show that the multifrequency far field patterns at a fixed observation direction uniquely determine the narrowest strip containing the source support. With the increase of the number of observation directions, a convex hull of the source support can be obtained. Based on the constructive uniqueness proof, we introduce a novel direct sampling method both for locating the point sources and for reconstructing the support of the extended source. A formula for computing the polarization strengths is also given. Numerical examples in two dimensions are presented to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methods for multiscale elastic sources.",

In this paper, we study a tumor-immune system interaction model with dendritic cell therapy and immune response delay. First, it is shown that the ODE version of the model has a Bogdanov–Takens (BT) singularity or a weak focus with multiplicity at most 1 for different parameter values. As the parameters vary, the ODE model undergoes supercritical Hopf bifurcation and supercritical BT bifurcation. Our analysis indicates that there exists a threshold value of the activation rate of T cells, below which tumor immune escape occurs, above or at which T cells and tumor cells coexist in the form of a stable periodic oscillation or steady state. Second, we study how the immune response delay affects the dynamics of the model. Our results reveal that the delay can destabilize the stable positive equilibrium through Hopf bifurcation. Furthermore, the direction and stability of Hopf bifurcation are derived. When there is a cusp, we show that it is a BT singularity for any delay and the delay model also undergoes BT bifurcation.

We investigate the unbiased model for money exchanges with collective debt limit: agents give at random time a dollar to one another as long as they have at least one dollar or they can borrow a dollar from a central bank if the bank is not empty. Surprisingly, this dynamic eventually leads to an asymmetric Laplace distribution of wealth (conjectured in [N. Xi, N. Ding, and Y. Wang, Phys.

This work addresses the modelling of oxygenic photogranules (OPGs), by introducing a mathematical model which describes both the genesis and growth of photogranules and the related treatment process. The photogranule has been modelled as a free boundary domain with radial symmetry, which evolves over time as a result of microbial growth, attachment, and detachment processes. Hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs have been considered to model at mesoscale the transport and growth of sessile biomass and the diffusion and conversion of soluble substrates. The macroscale behavior of the system has been modelled through first order impulsive ordinary differential equations (IDEs), which reproduce a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) configuration. Phototrophic biomass has been considered for the first time in granular biofilms, and cyanobacteria and microalgae have been accounted separately, to model their metabolic differences. To describe the key role of cyanobacteria in the photogranulation process, the attachment velocity of all suspended microbial species has been modelled as a function of the cyanobacteria concentration in suspended form. The model takes into account the main biological processes involved in OPG-based systems: metabolic activity of cyanobacteria, microalgae, heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria, microbial decay, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secretion, symbiotic and competitive interactions between different species, light-dark cycle, light attenuation across the granule, and photoinhibition phenomena. The model has been integrated numerically, and the results show its consistency in describing the photogranule evolution and ecology, and highlight the advantages of the OPG technology, analyzing the effects of the influent wastewater composition and light conditions on the process.",
