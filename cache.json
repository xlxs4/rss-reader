          "description": "Learning the design patterns of proteins from sequences across evolution may have promise toward generative protein design. However it is unknown whether language models, trained on sequences of natural proteins, will be capable of more than memorization of existing protein families. Here we show that language models generalize beyond natural proteins to generate de novo proteins. We focus on two protein design tasks: fixed backbone design where the structure is specified, and unconstrained generation where the structure is sampled from the model. Remarkably although the models are trained only on sequences, we find that they are capable of designing structure. A total of 228 generated proteins are evaluated experimentally with high overall success rates (152/228 or 67%) in producing a soluble and monomeric species by size exclusion chromatography. Out of 152 experimentally successful designs, 35 have no significant sequence match to known natural proteins. Of the remaining 117, sequence identity to the nearest sequence match is at median 27%, below 20% for 6 designs, and as low as 18% for 3 designs. For fixed backbone design, the language model generates successful designs for each of eight experimentally evaluated artificially created fixed backbone targets. For unconstrained generation, sampled proteins cover diverse topologies and secondary structure compositions, and have high experimental success rate (71/129 or 55%). The designs reflect deep patterns linking sequence and structure, including motifs that occur in related natural structures, and motifs that are not observed in similar structural contexts in known protein families. The results show that language models, though only trained on sequences, learn a deep grammar that enables the design of protein structure, extending beyond natural proteins.",

          "description": "Combining a basic set of building blocks into more complex forms is a universal design principle. Most protein designs have proceeded from a manual bottom-up approach using parts created by nature, but top-down design of proteins is fundamentally hard due to biological complexity. We demonstrate how the modularity and programmability long sought for protein design can be realized through generative artificial intelligence. Advanced protein language models demonstrate emergent learning of atomic resolution structure and protein design principles. We leverage these developments to enable the programmable design of de novo protein sequences and structures of high complexity. First, we describe a high-level programming language based on modular building blocks that allows a designer to easily compose a set of desired properties. We then develop an energy-based generative model, built on atomic resolution structure prediction with a language model, that realizes all-atom structure designs that have the programmed properties. Designing a diverse set of specifications, including constraints on atomic coordinates, secondary structure, symmetry, and multimerization, demonstrates the generality and controllability of the approach. Enumerating constraints at increasing levels of hierarchical complexity shows that the approach can access a combinatorially large design space.",

          "description": "The global energy crisis challenges us to develop more efficient strategies for the sustainable production of energy. Given the excellent efficiency of the natural photosynthetic apparatus, biohybrid photovoltaic devices present an attractive solution for solar energy conversion. However, their composition, stability, and complexity can limit their inclusion into photovoltaic devices. Here, we combined computational design and directed evolution to overcome these limitations and create tailor-made photoenzymes. Photo-biocatalysts were designed by introducing photosensitizer binding sites into heme-containing helical bundle proteins. The designed binding sites were specific for the target photosensitizer and readily transplanted into other helical bundles. The best design was highly evolvable and reached nanomolar ligand affinity after mutagenesis and screening. The evolved enzyme generated 2.6 times higher photocurrents than the photosensitizer alone, primarily driven by increased photostability. Evolvability is a unique advantage of our protein-based approach over abiological photovoltaic and will be critical to developing efficient biohybrid systems.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=114 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/521207v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18245ddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b8c261org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e18deforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2d5cee_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

          "description": "In resource-limited settings, it can be difficult to safely deliver sensitive biologic medicines to patients due to cold chain and infrastructure constraints. Point-of-care drug manufacturing could circumvent these challenges since medicines could be produced locally and used on-demand. Towards this vision, we combine cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) and a 2-in-1 affinity purification and enzymatic cleavage scheme to develop a platform for point-of-care drug manufacturing. As a model, we use this platform to synthesize a panel of peptide hormones, an important class of medications that can be used to treat a wide variety of diseases including diabetes, osteoporosis, and growth disorders. With this approach, temperature-stable lyophilized CFPS reaction components can be rehydrated with DNA encoding a SUMOylated peptide hormone of interest when needed. Strep-Tactin(R) affinity purification and on-bead SUMO protease cleavage yields peptide hormones in their native form that are recognized by ELISA antibodies and that can bind their respective receptors. With further development to ensure proper biologic activity and patient safety, we envision this platform could be used to manufacture valuable peptide hormone drugs at the point-of-care in resource-limited settings.",

          "description": "Artificial intelligence has the potential to open insight into the structure of proteins at the scale of evolution. It has only recently been possible to extend protein structure prediction to two hundred million cataloged proteins. Characterizing the structures of the exponentially growing billions of protein sequences revealed by large scale gene sequencing experiments would necessitate a breakthrough in the speed of folding. Here we show that direct inference of structure from primary sequence using a large language model enables an order of magnitude speed-up in high resolution structure prediction. Leveraging the insight that language models learn evolutionary patterns across millions of sequences, we train models up to 15B parameters, the largest language model of proteins to date. As the language models are scaled they learn information that enables prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of individual atoms. This results in prediction that is up to 60x faster than state-of-the-art while maintaining resolution and accuracy. Building on this, we present the ESM Metagenomic Atlas. This is the first large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins, with more than 617 million structures. The atlas reveals more than 225 million high confidence predictions, including millions whose structures are novel in comparison with experimentally determined structures, giving an unprecedented view into the vast breadth and diversity of the structures of some of the least understood proteins on earth.",

          "description": "Obesity is rapidly increasing within the global population and is one of the leading causes of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular diseases. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for treating T2D and obesity. However, the route of administration of the GLP-1R agonists is currently by injection or high oral dosages of the therapeutic combined with absorption enhancers. Oral delivery of GLP-1R agonists remains the preferred administration route due to convenience and high patient compliance. Thus, strategies to improve the oral delivery of this therapeutic are needed. In this study, we engineered the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii strain to produce Exendin-4, a GLP-1R agonist, in the gastrointestinal tract to reduce the adverse effects of diet-induced obesity in male C57BL/6 mice. The biological efficiency of the secreted Exendin-4 from S. boulardii was characterised ex vivo on isolated pancreatic islets, demonstrating induced insulin secretion. Furthermore, in vivo characterisation of the engineered strain identified a synergistic effect of cold exposure and Sb-Exe4 by successfully inhibiting appetite and promoting body weight loss under cold exposure (8{degrees}C). In addition, the combination of cold and Sb-Exe4 improved the glucose and lipid homeostasis in the mice by increasing the circulating glucagon level and reducing the inflammatory marker TNF-a. Our results demonstrate that S. boulardii can be genetically modified to secrete and deliver active therapeutic GLP-1R agonists in the gastrointestinal tract improving the metabolism of the host.",

          "description": "Despite growing knowledge of the functions of individual human transcriptional effector domains, much less is understood about how multiple effector domains within the same protein combine to regulate gene expression. Here, we measure transcriptional activity for 8,400 effector domain combinations by recruiting them to reporter genes in human cells. In our assay, weak and moderate activation domains synergize to drive strong gene expression, while combining strong activators often results in weaker activation. In contrast, repressors combine linearly and produce full gene silencing, and repressor domains often overpower activation domains. We use this information to build a synthetic transcription factor whose function can be tuned between repression and activation independent of recruitment to target genes by using a small molecule drug. Altogether, we outline the basic principles of how effector domains combine to regulate gene expression and demonstrate their value in building precise and flexible synthetic biology tools.",

          "description": "The traditional whole-cell biocatalysis typically utilizes the heterotrophic microbes as the biocatalyst, which requires carbohydrates to power the cofactor (ATP, NAD(P)H) regeneration. In this study, we sought to harness purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacterium (PNSB) as the biocatalyst to achieve light-driven cofactor regeneration for cascade biocatalysis. We substantially improved the performance of PNSB-based biocatalysis by using a highly active and conditional expression system, blocking the side-reactions, controlling the feeding strategy, and attenuating the light shading effect. We found that 50 mM ferulic acid could be completely converted to vanillyl alcohol in the recombinant strain, reaching 7.7 g/L vanillyl alcohol. In addition, >99.9% conversion of p-coumaric acid to p-hydroxybenzoic alcohol (6.21 g/L) was similarly achieved under light-anaerobic conditions. Moreover, we examined the isoprenol utilization pathway (IUP) for pinene synthesis and 13.81 mM pinene (1.88 g/L) with 92.1% conversion rate from isoprenol was obtained. Taken together, these results suggested that PNSB could be a promising host for light-powered biotransformation, which offers an efficient approach for synthesizing value-added chemicals in a green and sustainable manner.",

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a common plastic whose deconstruction through chemical or biological means has received much attention. However, a limited number of alternative products have been formed from PET deconstruction, and only a small share could serve as building blocks for alternative materials or therapeutics. Here, we demonstrate the production of useful mono-amine and diamine building blocks from known PET deconstruction products. We achieve this by designing one-pot biocatalytic transformations that are informed by the substrate specificity of an {omega}-transaminase and diverse carboxylic acid reductases (CAR) towards…",

          "description": "The functional analysis of protein nanopores is typically conducted in planar lipid bilayers or liposomes exploiting high-resolution but low-throughput electrical and optical read-outs. Yet, the reconstitution of protein nanopores in vitro still constitutes an empiric and low-throughput process. Addressing these limitations, nanopores can now be analysed using the functional nanopore (FuN) screen exploiting genetically-encoded fluorescent protein sensors that resolve distinct nanopore-dependent Ca2+ in- and efflux patterns across the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. With a primary proof-of-concept established for the S2168 holin, and thereof based recombinant nanopore assemblies, the question arises to what extent alternative nanopores can be analysed with the FuN screen. Focussing on self-assembling membrane peptides, three sets of 13 different nanopores are assessed for their capacity to form nanopores in the context of the FuN screen. Nanopores tested comprise both natural and computationally-designed nanopores while a comparison with high-resolution biophysical studies provides an experimental benchmark for future studies.",

We give an example of a three-dimensional system of differential equations, which is centrally symmetric and mirror symmetric. We show that the system has a Lorenz-like attractor, which contains three saddle equilibrium states and consists of two mirror-symmetric components that are adjacent at the symmetry plane. We also found a discrete-time analog of this “conjoined-twins” attractor in a cubic three-dimensional Hénon map with a central symmetry. We show numerically that both attractors are pseudohyperbolic, which guarantees that each orbit of the attractor has a positive maximal Lyapunov exponent, and this property is preserved under small perturbations. We also describe bifurcation scenarios for the emergence of the attractors in one-parameter families of three-dimensional flows and maps possessing the symmetries.",

One of them is the friendship paradox, which states that on average, your friends have more friends than you do. Its generalization, called the generalized friendship paradox (GFP), states that on average, your friends have higher attributes than yours. Despite successful demonstrations of the GFP by empirical analyses and numerical simulations, analytical, rigorous understanding of the GFP has been largely unexplored. Recently, an analytical solution for the probability that the GFP holds for an individual in a network with correlated attributes was obtained using the copula method but by assuming a locally tree structure of the underlying network [Jo et al., Phys. Rev. E 104, 054301 (2021)]. Considering the abundant triangles in most social networks, we employ a vine copula method to incorporate the attribute correlation structure between neighbors of a focal individual in addition to the correlation between the focal individual and its neighbors. Our analytical approach helps us rigorously understand the GFP in more general networks, such as clustered networks and other related interesting phenomena in social networks.",

In the present paper, this term does not refer to the signal processing issues and telecommunications.) allows us to control noise-induced dynamics of multilayer networks in the regime of stochastic resonance. We illustrate this effect on an example of two- and multi-layer networks of bistable overdamped oscillators. In particular, we demonstrate that multiplexing suppresses the effect of stochastic resonance if the periodic forcing is present in only one layer. In contrast, multiplexing allows us to enhance the stochastic resonance if the periodic forcing and noise are present in all the interacting layers. In such a case, the impact of multiplexing has a resonant character: the most pronounced effect of stochastic resonance is achieved for an appropriate intermediate value of coupling strength between the layers. Moreover, multiplexing-induced enhancement of the stochastic resonance can become more pronounced for the increasing number of coupled layers. To visualize the revealed phenomena, we use the evolution of the dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio on the noise intensity for varying strength of coupling between the layers.",

Since the existence of negative heat capacity is a rule rather an exception in astrophysics, we would like to analyze the possibility of the thermodynamic equilibrium for a paradigmatic astrophysical situation: the binary system. The possible explanation arises after decomposing the dynamical variables into internal and collective degrees of freedom, which enables us to reinterpret binary systems as two systems [math] and [math] that interact between them through a third low dimensional system [math]. Our central result is the derivation of a Langevin equation to describe the dynamics of the collective degrees of freedom. Our preliminary analysis evidences that the proposed framework is able not only to describe the system stability, but also unstable processes, such as escape or collapse of the binary system. These processes crucially depend on the angular momentum, the quadrupole–orbit coupling among internal and collective degrees of freedom, as well as internal temperatures of each system.",

The [math]-function related to a delayed variable is first developed to judge the crossing, sliding, and grazing motions at the boundary points. Then, basic and local mappings, together with their motion equations, are classified by current and delayed states of a local flow. It is shown that periodic motions can be predicted analytically in terms of the return mapping and the initial value function provided posteriorly. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the existence of slowly oscillating periodic solutions without or with sliding portions as well as a crossing periodic solution not slowly oscillating. These results not only enrich and extend switchability theory of discontinuous delayed systems, but also reveal some complicated periodic behaviors which cannot be found in continuous delayed systems and discontinuous systems without time delay.",

Here, we push a fresh perspective toward white noise that, grounded on combinatorial considerations, contributes to giving new interesting insights both for modeling and theoretical purposes. To this aim, we incorporate the ordinal pattern analysis approach, which allows us to abstract a time series as a sequence of patterns and their associated permutations, and introduce a simple functional over permutations that partitions them into classes encoding their level of asymmetry. We compute the exact probability mass function (p.m.f.) of this functional over the symmetric group of degree [math], thus providing the description for the case of an infinite white noise realization. This p.m.f. can be conveniently approximated by a continuous probability density from an exponential family, the Gaussian, hence providing natural sufficient statistics that render a convenient and simple statistical analysis through ordinal patterns. Such analysis is exemplified on experimental data for the spatial increments from tracks of gold nanoparticles in 3D diffusion.",

For the non-delayed temporal system, we examined the dissipativeness and persistence of the solutions. The existence of equilibria and stability analysis is performed to comprehend the complex behavior of the proposed model. Bifurcation of codimension-1, such as Hopf-bifurcation and saddle-node, is investigated. In addition, it is observed that increasing the strength of fear may induce periodic oscillations, and a higher value of fear may lead to the extinction of prey species. The system shows a bistability attribute involving two stable equilibria. The impact of providing spatial refuge to the prey population is also examined. We noticed that prey refuge benefits both species up to a specific threshold value beyond which it turns detrimental to predator species. For the non-spatial delayed system, the direction and stability of Hopf-bifurcation are investigated with the help of the center manifold theorem and normal form theory. We noticed that increasing the delay parameter may destabilize the system by producing periodic oscillations. For the spatiotemporal system, we derived the analytical conditions for Turing instability. We investigated the pattern dynamics driven by self-diffusion. The biological significance of various Turing patterns, such as cold spots, stripes, hot spots, and organic labyrinth, is examined. We analyzed the criterion for Hopf-bifurcation for the delayed spatiotemporal system. The impact of fear response delay on spatial patterns is investigated. Numerical simulations are illustrated to corroborate the analytical findings.",

The method focuses on the multi-step model, while conventional sparse regression methods, such as the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics method (SINDy), are one-step models. We adopt sparse representation and assume that the underlying equations involve only a small number of functions among possible candidates in a library. The new development in MSA is to use a multi-step model, i.e., predictions from an approximate evolution scheme based on initial points. Accordingly, the loss function comprises the total error at all time steps between the measured series and predicted series with the same initial point. This enables MSA to capture the dynamics directly from the noisy measurements, resisting the corruption of noise. By use of several numerical examples, we demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed MSA method, including a two-dimensional chaotic map, the logistic map, a two-dimensional damped oscillator, the Lorenz system, and a reduced order model of a self-sustaining process in turbulent shear flows. We also perform further studies under challenging conditions, such as noisy measurements, missing data, and large time step sizes. Furthermore, in order to resolve the difficulty of the nonlinear optimization, we suggest an adaptive training strategy, namely, by gradually increasing the length of time series for training. Higher prediction accuracy is achieved in an illustrative example of the chaotic map by the adaptive strategy.",

We argue here that these biases can be particularly pronounced due to misrepresentation, in these models, of the multidecadal internal climate variability characterized by large-scale, hemispheric-to-global patterns. This point is illustrated through the development and analysis of a prototype climate model comprised of two damped linear oscillators, which mimic interannual and multidecadal internal climate dynamics and are set into motion via a combination of stochastic driving, representing weather noise, and deterministic external forcing inducing a secular climate change. The model time series are paired with pre-specified patterns in the physical space and form, conceptually, a spatially extended time series of the zonal-mean near-surface temperature, which is further contaminated by a spatiotemporal noise simulating the rest of climate variability. The choices of patterns and model parameters were informed by observations and climate-model simulations of the 20th century near-surface air temperature. Our main finding is that the intensity and spatial patterns of the internal multidecadal variability associated with the slow-oscillator model component greatly affect (i) the ability of modern pattern-recognition/fingerprinting methods to isolate the forced response of the climate system in the 20th century ensemble simulations and (ii) climate-system predictability, especially decadal predictability, as well as the estimates of this predictability using climate models in which the internal multidecadal variability is underestimated or otherwise misrepresented.",

Despite this, in two spatial dimensions, direct numerical simulations reveal the presence of stable single- and multi-spot states whose properties depend on the repulsion from nearby spots as well as the shape of the domain and the boundary conditions imposed thereon.

Because of these potential applications, the study of the collective behaviors of fractional-order complex networks has been investigated in the literature. In this work, we investigate the influence of higher-order interactions in fractional-order complex systems. We consider both two-body and three-body diffusive interactions. To elucidate the role of higher-order interaction, we show how the network of oscillators is synchronized for different values of fractional-order. The stability of synchronization is studied with a master stability function analysis. Our results show that higher-order interactions among complex networks help the earlier synchronization of networks with a lesser value of first-order coupling strengths in fractional-order complex simplices. Besides that, the fractional-order also shows a notable impact on synchronization of complex simplices. For the lower value of fractional-order, the systems get synchronized earlier, with lesser coupling strengths in both two-body and three-body interactions. To show the generality in the outcome, two neuron models, namely, Hindmarsh–Rose and Morris–Leccar, and a nonlinear Rössler oscillator are considered for our analysis.",

In this work, we focus on a combination of DMD and delay-coordinates embedding, which is termed delay-coordinates DMD and is based on augmenting observations from current and past time steps, accommodating the analysis of a broad family of observations. An important utility of DMD is the compact and reduced-order spectral representation of observations in terms of the DMD eigenvalues and modes, where the temporal information is separated from the spatial information. From a spatiotemporal viewpoint, we show that when DMD is applied to delay-coordinates embedding, temporal information is intertwined with spatial information, inducing a particular spectral structure on the DMD components. We formulate and analyze this structure, which we term the spatiotemporal coupling in delay-coordinates DMD. Based on this spatiotemporal coupling, we propose a new method for DMD components selection. When using delay-coordinates DMD that comprises redundant modes, this selection is an essential step for obtaining a compact and reduced-order representation of the observations. We demonstrate our method on noisy simulated signals and various dynamical systems and show superior component selection compared to a commonly used method that relies on the amplitudes of the modes.",

Therefore, having methods for classifying hyperchaotic, chaotic, and regular dynamics using only the observational data generated either by the theoretical or the experimental systems is crucial. In this paper, we use single nonlinear node delay-based reservoir computers to separate hyperchaotic, chaotic, and regular dynamics. We show that their classification capabilities are robust with an accuracy of up to 99.61% and 99.03% using the Mackey–Glass and the optoelectronic oscillator delay-based reservoir computers, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that the reservoir computers trained with the two-dimensional Hénon-logistic map can classify the dynamical state of another system (for instance, the two-dimensional sine-logistic modulation map).

NCSs, although designed for steady operation, have been found to exhibit dynamical behavior, such as periodic oscillations, depending on the input heater power. The heater power, otherwise assumed to be steady, can be fluctuating in practice. The present study focuses on the dynamics of a single-phase square NCS, which exhibits periodic dynamics and is subjected to an external harmonic perturbation (chosen as the simplest form of fluctuation) over the steady heater power. The objective of the study is to study the dynamics of NCS under external (harmonic) disturbances using the framework of forced synchronization. Toward that, a 1D transient model of a square-shaped NCS is simulated with harmonically forced input power. The transition in the nature of synchronization between mass flux oscillations and the external forcing has been characterized by varying the frequency and amplitude of external perturbation independently. We find different nonlinear effects of the harmonic forcing, such as exhibition of quasiperiodic dynamics, frequency pulling/pushing, and frequency locking or forced synchronization. The aforementioned characterization techniques open up an avenue for detailed analysis of the more complex type of fluctuating input heat in real systems.",

Two quantities are proposed for determining the chaotic or regular nature of orbits in a system’s phase space, which are based on the values of the LDs of these orbits and of nearby ones: The difference and ratio of neighboring orbits’ LDs. Using as generic test models the prototypical two degree of freedom Hénon–Heiles system and the two-dimensional standard map, we find that these indicators are able to correctly characterize the chaotic or regular nature of orbits to better than 90% agreement with results obtained by implementing the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI) method, which is a well-established chaos detection technique. Further investigating the performance of the two introduced quantities, we discuss the effects of the total integration time and of the spacing between the used neighboring orbits on the accuracy of the methods, finding that even typical short time, coarse-grid LD computations are sufficient to provide reliable quantification of the systems’ chaotic component, using less CPU time than the SALI. In addition to quantifying chaos, the introduced indicators have the ability to reveal details about the systems’ local and global chaotic phase space structure.

The edge folds of the origami structure are generated by the saddle-node bifurcations. For each edge, there are two layers to form the origami structure. On one layer of the origami structure, there is a pair of period-doubling bifurcations inducing periodic motions from period-1 to period-2n motions [math]. On such a layer, the unstable period-1 motion goes to the homoclinic orbits with a mapping eigenvalue approaching negative infinity. However, on the corresponding adjacent layers, no period-doubling bifurcations exist, and the unstable period-1 motion goes to the homoclinic orbit with a mapping eigenvalue approaching positive infinity. To determine the origami structure of the period-1 motions to homoclinic orbits, the implicit map of the Rössler system is developed through the discretization of the corresponding differential equations. The Poincaré mapping section can be selected arbitrarily. Before construction of the origami structure, the bifurcation diagram of periodic motions varying with one parameter is developed, and trajectories of stable periodic motions on the bifurcation diagram to homoclinic orbits are illustrated. Finally, the origami structures of period-1 motions to homoclinic orbits are developed through a few layers. This study provides the mathematical mechanisms of period-1 motions to homoclinic orbits, which help one better understand the complexity of periodic motions near the corresponding homoclinic orbit. There are two types of infinitely many homoclinic orbits in the Rössler system, and the corresponding mapping structures of the homoclinic orbits possess positive and negative infinity large eigenvalues. Such infinitely many homoclinic orbits are induced through unstable periodic motions with positive and negative eigenvalues accordingly.",

In this work, we use rotating magnets positioned in a line or at the vertices of a regular polygon. The rotation planes of the magnets can be modified at will. The rich structure of stable and unstable configurations is dictated by symmetry and the side of the polygon. We show that both symmetric solutions and their symmetry-breaking bifurcations can be explained with group theory.

The dynamics of the oscillators associated with the nodes are assumed to be identical and influenced by mean-field repulsive interactions. An interplay of topological heterogeneity and the repulsive interaction between the dynamical units of the network triggers extreme events in the nodes when each node succumbs to such events for discretely different ranges of repulsive coupling. A high degree node is vulnerable to weaker repulsive interactions, while a low degree node is susceptible to stronger interactions. As a result, the formation of extreme events changes position with increasing strength of repulsive interaction from high to low degree nodes. Extreme events at any node are identified with the appearance of occasional large-amplitude events (amplitude of the temporal dynamics) that are larger than a threshold height and rare in occurrence, which we confirm by estimating the probability distribution of all events. Extreme events appear at any oscillator near the boundary of transition from rotation to libration at a critical value of the repulsive coupling strength. To explore the phenomenon, a paradigmatic second-order phase model is used to represent the dynamics of the oscillator associated with each node. We make an annealed network approximation to reduce our original model and, thereby, confirm the dual role of the repulsive interaction and the degree of a node in the origin of extreme events in any oscillator associated with a node.",

It was recently demonstrated [M. Tyloo, J. Phys. Complex. 3 03LT01 (2022)] that layered complex networks may exhibit amplified fluctuations. Here, I investigate how noise with system-specific correlations impacts the first escape time of nonlinearly coupled oscillators. Interestingly, I show that, not only the strong amplification of the fluctuations is a threat to the good functioning of the network but also the spatial and temporal correlations of the noise along the lowest-lying eigenmodes of the Laplacian matrix.

This study proposes the hub-collision avoidance and leaf-node options (HALO) algorithm. In the box sampling process, a forward sampling rule (for avoiding hub collisions) and a reverse sampling rule (for preferentially selecting leaf nodes) are determined for bidirectional network traversal to reduce the randomness of sampling. In the box selection process, the larger necessary boxes are preferentially selected to join the solution by continuously removing small boxes. The compact-box-burning (CBB) algorithm, the maximum-excluded-mass-burning (MEMB) algorithm, the overlapping-box-covering (OBCA) algorithm, and the algorithm for combining small-box-removal strategy and maximum box sampling with a sampling density of 30 (SM30)  are compared with HALO in experiments. Results on nine real networks show that HALO achieves the highest performance score and obtains 11.40%, 7.67%, 2.18%, and 8.19% fewer boxes than the compared algorithms, respectively. The algorithm determinism is significantly improved. The fractal dimensions estimated by covering four standard networks are more accurate. Moreover, different from MEMB or OBCA, HALO is not affected by the tightness of the hubs and exhibits a stable performance in different networks. Finally, the time complexities of HALO and the compared algorithms are all [math], which is reasonable and acceptable.",

However, existing electromechanical models of servomotors typically omit consideration of the switching power converter circuits required for directional, speed, or torque control. In this study, a multi-domain framework is established for switched electromechanical dynamics in servomotor systems for their analysis and control in general aperiodic tasks including transient phases. The switched electromechanical dynamics is derived from the individual models of the internal DC motor, gear train, and H-bridge circuit. The coupled models comprehensively integrate all possible distinct switching configurations of on-state, off-state, and dead time. A combination of cycle averaging with piecewise analytical solutions of the non-smooth dynamics is introduced to handle different temporal scales from high-frequency electrical to low-frequency mechanical variables. System parameters were estimated from experimental data using a dual-servomotor test platform. The model was validated for predictive accuracy against measured data in two distinct tasks—dynamic braking of a pendulum system and sinusoidal trajectory following. The model was also used to formulate the servomotor power consumption, which was implemented for optimal control demonstration and energy analysis. In particular, the servomotor power consumption model provided true optimality (minimization) when compared with the squared rotor torque and the positive rotor mechanical power that are commonly used as proxy models. While the focus of this work is on permanent-magnet, armature-controlled brushed DC servomotors, the approach is applicable to general electromechanical systems with switching-based control.",

Here, we consider the first encounters between two particles (e.g., prey A and predator B) embedded in the Watts–Strogatz networks and the Barabási–Albert networks. We address numerically the mean first-encounter time (MFET) while the two particles are moving and the mean first-passage time (MFPT) while the prey is fixed, aiming at uncovering the impact of the prey’s motion on the encounter time, and the conditions where the motion of the prey would accelerate (or slow) the encounter between the two particles. Different initial conditions are considered. In the case where the two particles start independently from sites that are selected randomly from the stationary distribution, on the Barabási–Albert networks, the MFET is far less than the MFPT, and the impact of prey’s motion on the encounter time is enormous, whereas, on the Watts–Strogatz networks (including Erdős-Rényi random networks), the MFET is about 0.5–1 times the MFPT, and the impact of prey’s motion on the encounter time is relatively small. We also consider the case where prey A starts from a fixed site and the predator starts from a randomly drawn site and present the conditions where the motion of the prey would accelerate (or slow) the encounter between the two particles.

We compute Wasserstein distances between distributions over sequences (“predictions”) using a finite-dimensional embedding of sequences based on the Cantor set for the underlying geometry. We show that exploratory data analysis using the resulting geometry via hierarchical clustering and dimension reduction provides insight into the temporal structure of processes ranging from the relatively simple (e.g., generated by finite-state hidden Markov models) to the very complex (e.g., generated by infinite-state indexed grammars).",

In deterministic amplitude–frequency responses, both hardening and softening effects are induced by non-smooth contact-type nonlinearities. Stabilities of the solutions are determined by the shooting method and the monodromy matrix. To effectively quantify the behaviors of nonlinear oscillators in the presence of parametric uncertainties, a non-intrusive surrogate function aided by arc-length ratio interpolation is constructed. Simulation results demonstrate variabilities of nonlinear responses under different non-random uncertainties. Moreover, an accuracy verification is provided to verify the effectiveness of the non-intrusive uncertainty propagation method. It is found that the surrogate function in combination with the arc-length ratio technique has high accuracy and evolutions of turning points are captured satisfactorily regardless of complex interactions of nonlinearities and uncertainties.

This phenomenon is well understood in the context of smooth slow–fast dynamical systems; in the present work, we study it for the first time in piecewise linear (PWL) slow–fast systems. This special class of systems is indeed known to reproduce all features of their smooth counterpart while being more amenable to quantitative analysis and offering some level of simplification, in particular, through the existence of canonical (linear) slow manifolds. We provide conditions for a PWL slow–fast system to exhibit a slow passage through a Hopf-like bifurcation, in link with possible connections between canonical attracting and repelling slow manifolds. In doing so, we fully describe the so-called way-in/way-out function. Finally, we investigate this slow passage effect in the Doi–Kumagai model, a neuronal PWL model exhibiting elliptic bursting oscillations.",

Two cases are investigated: first, the case of the presence of a Raman term, and second, the simultaneous presence of two nonlinear gradient terms, the Raman term and the dispersion of nonlinear gain. As possible types of time-dependence, we find a number of different possibilities including periodic behavior, quasi-periodic behavior, and also chaos. These different types of time-dependence are found to form quite frequently from a window structure of alternating behavior, for example, of periodic and quasi-periodic behaviors. To analyze the time dependence, we exploit extensively time series and Fourier transforms. We discuss in detail quantitatively the question whether all the DSs found for the cubic complex Ginzburg–Landau equation with nonlinear gradient terms are generic, meaning whether they are stable against structural perturbations, for example, to the additions of a small quintic perturbation as it arises naturally in an envelope equation framework. Finally, we examine to what extent it is possible to have different types of DSs for fixed parameter values in the equation by just varying the initial conditions, for example, by using narrow and high vs broad and low amplitudes. These results indicate an overlapping multi-basin structure in parameter space.",

On the background frequency and background amplitude plane, the modulation stability region consists of two symmetric curves on the left and right and a point on the symmetry axis. We find that the higher-order excitation characteristics are obviously different at different positions in the modulation stability region. Their excitation characteristics are closely related to the modulation instability distribution characteristics of the system. It is shown that asymmetric high-order rational solitons are excited at the left and right stable curves, and the symmetric one is excited at the stable points. Interestingly, the asymmetric higher-order rational solitons on the left and right sides are mirror-symmetrical to each other, which coincides with the symmetry of the modulation instability distribution.

We present here a broad class of dynamical systems that are ideal for modeling such activity. The models we propose are chaotic heteroclinic networks with nontrivial intersections of stable and unstable manifolds. Due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, transitions between states are seemingly random. Dwell times, exit distributions, and other transition statistics can be built into the model through geometric design and can be controlled by tunable parameters. To test our model’s ability to simulate realistic biological phenomena, we turned to one of the most studied organisms, C. elegans, well known for its limited behavioral states. We reconstructed experimental data from two laboratories, demonstrating the model’s ability to quantitatively reproduce dwell times and transition statistics under a variety of conditions. Stochastic switching between dominant states in complex dynamical systems has been extensively studied and is often modeled as Markov chains. As an alternative, we propose here a new paradigm, namely, chaotic heteroclinic networks generated by deterministic rules (without the necessity for noise). Chaotic heteroclinic networks can be used to model systems with arbitrary architecture and size without a commensurate increase in phase dimension. They are highly flexible and able to capture a wide range of transition characteristics that can be adjusted through control parameters.",

To this end, this paper presents a novel adaptive synapse-based neuron (ASN) model with sine activation function. The ASN model has time-varying equilibria with the variation of externally applied current and its equilibrium stability involves transitions between stable and unstable points through fold and Hopf bifurcations, resulting in complex distributions of attractive regions with heterogeneous multi-stability. Globally coexisting heterogeneous behaviors are studied by bifurcation diagram, phase portrait, dynamical distribution, and basin of attraction. The results show that the number of coexisting heterogeneous attractors can be up to 12, but for a simple neuron model, such a large number of coexisting heterogeneous attractors has not been reported in the relevant literature. Most interestingly, the ASN model also has riddled-like complex basins of attraction and four illustrative examples are depicted by the phase portraits with small changes of the initial conditions. Besides, the ASN model is implemented using a simple microcontroller platform, and various heterogeneous coexisting attractors are acquired experimentally to validate the numerical results.",

In this article, we present a mathematical model that describes these in vitro experiments. We use the model to understand how tumour growth generates mechanical deformations in the hydrogel and how these deformations in turn influence the tumour’s growth. The hydrogel is viewed as a nonlinear hyperelastic material and the tumour is modelled as a two-phase mixture, comprising a viscous tumour cell phase and an isotropic, inviscid interstitial fluid phase. Using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques, we show how the tumour’s growth dynamics change as the mechanical properties of the hydrogel vary. When the hydrogel is soft, nutrient availability dominates the dynamics: the tumour evolves to a large equilibrium configuration where the proliferation rate of nutrient-rich cells on the tumour boundary balances the death rate of nutrient-starved cells in the central, necrotic core. As the hydrogel stiffness increases, mechanical resistance to growth increases and the tumour’s equilibrium size decreases. Indeed, for small tumours embedded in stiff hydrogels, the inhibitory force experienced by the tumour cells may be so large that the tumour is eliminated. Analysis of the model identifies parameter regimes in which the presence of the hydrogel drives tumour elimination.",

The main novelty is the introduction of sparse interactions: each firing neuron triggers an instantaneous increase in electric potential to a fixed number of randomly chosen neurons. We prove that, as the number of neurons approaches infinity, the finite network converges to a nonlinear mean-field process characterised by a jump-type stochastic differential equation. We show that this process displays a phase transition: the activity of a typical neuron in the infinite network either rapidly dies out, or persists forever, depending on the global parameters describing the intensity of interconnection. This provides a way to understand the emergence of persistent activity triggered by weak input signals in large neural networks.",

Alterations in node properties during pathology and/or development are known to affect the speed and quality of electrical transmission. From a modelling standpoint, nodes of Ranvier are often described by systems of ordinary differential equations neglecting or greatly simplifying their geometric structure. These approaches fail to accurately describe how fine scale alteration in the node geometry or in myelin thickness in the paranode region will impact action potential generation and transmission. Here, we rely on a finite element approximation to describe the three dimensional geometry of a node of Ranvier. With this, we are able to investigate how sensitive is the electrical response to alterations in the myelin sheath and paranode geometry. We could in particular investigate irregular loss of myelin, which might be more physiologically relevant than the uniform loss often described through simpler modelling approaches.",

On sloped terrain, vegetation patterns occur as stripes perpendicular to the contours. Field studies report contrasting long-term dynamics between different observation sites; some observe slow uphill migration of vegetation bands while some report stationary patterns. In this paper, we show that long-range seed dispersal provides a mechanism that enables the occurrence of both migrating and stationary patterns. We utilise a nonlocal PDE model in which seed dispersal is accounted for by a convolution term. The model represents vegetation patterns as periodic travelling waves and numerical continuation shows that both migrating and almost stationary patterns are stable if seed dispersal distances are sufficiently large. We use a perturbation theory approach to obtain analytical confirmation of the existence of almost stationary patterned solutions and provide a biological interpretation of the phenomenon.",

          "description": "Abstract\nCellular senescence can induce dual effects (promotion or inhibition) on cancer progression. While immune cells naturally respond and migrate toward various chemotactic sources from the tumor mass, various factors including senescent tumor cells (STCs) in the tumor microenvironment may affect this chemotactic movement. In this work, we investigate the mutual interactions between the tumor cells and the immune cells that either inhibit or facilitate tumor growth by developing a mathematical model that consists of taxis–reaction–diffusion equations and receptor kinetics for the key players in the interaction network. We apply a mathematical model to a transwell Boyden chamber invasion assay used in the experiments to illustrate that STCs can play a pivotal role in negating immune attack through tight regulation of intra- and extra-cellular signaling molecules. In particular, we show that senescent tumor cells in cell cycle arrest can block intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ T cells by secreting a high level of CXCL12, which leads to significant reduction its receptors, CXCR4, on T cells, and thus impaired chemotaxis. The predictions of nonlinear responses to CXCL12 were in good agreement with experimental data. We tested several hypotheses on immune-tumor interactions under various biochemical conditions in the tumor microenvironment and developed new concepts for anti-tumor strategies targeting senescence induced immune impairment.",

          "description": "Abstract\nPhylogenetic diversity indices such as the Fair Proportion (FP) index are frequently discussed as prioritization criteria in biodiversity conservation. They rank species according to their contribution to overall diversity by taking into account the unique and shared evolutionary history of each species as indicated by its placement in an underlying phylogenetic tree. Traditionally, phylogenetic trees were inferred from single genes and the resulting gene trees were assumed to be a valid estimate for the species tree, i.e., the “true” evolutionary history of the species under consideration. However, nowadays it is common to sequence whole genomes of hundreds or thousands of genes, and it is often the case that conflicting genealogical histories exist in different genes throughout the genome, resulting in discordance between individual gene trees and the species tree. Here, we analyze the effects of gene and species tree discordance on prioritization decisions based on the FP index. In particular, we consider the ranking order of taxa induced by (i) The FP index on a species tree, and (ii) The expected FP index across all gene tree histories associated with the species tree. On the one hand, we show that for particular tree shapes, the two rankings always coincide. On the other hand, we show that for all leaf numbers greater than or equal to five, there exist species trees for which the two rankings differ.

          "description": "Abstract\nPhylogenetic networks extend phylogenetic trees to model non-vertical inheritance, by which a lineage inherits material from multiple parents. The computational complexity of estimating phylogenetic networks from genome-wide data with likelihood-based methods limits the size of networks that can be handled. Methods based on pairwise distances could offer faster alternatives. We study here the information that average pairwise distances contain on the underlying phylogenetic network, by characterizing local and global features that can or cannot be identified. For general networks, we clarify that the root and edge lengths adjacent to reticulations are not identifiable, and then focus on the class of zipped-up semidirected networks. We provide a criterion to swap subgraphs locally, such as 3-cycles, resulting in indistinguishable networks. We propose the “distance split tree”, which can be constructed from pairwise distances, and prove that it is a refinement of the network’s tree of blobs, capturing the tree-like features of the network. For level-1 networks, this distance split tree is equal to the tree of blobs refined to separate polytomies from blobs, and we prove that the mixed representation of the network is identifiable. The information loss is localized around 4-cycles, for which the placement of the reticulation is unidentifiable. The mixed representation combines split edges for 4-cycles, regular tree and hybrid edges from the semidirected network, and edge parameters that encode all information identifiable from average pairwise distances.",

          "description": "Abstract\nRecent progress in nanotechnology-enabled sensors that can be placed inside of living plants has shown that it is possible to relay and record real-time chemical signaling stimulated by various abiotic and biotic stresses. The mathematical form of the resulting local reactive oxygen species (ROS) wave released upon mechanical perturbation of plant leaves appears to be conserved across a large number of species, and produces a distinct waveform from other stresses including light, heat and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-induced stresses. Herein, we develop a quantitative theory of the local ROS signaling waveform resulting from mechanical stress in planta. We show that nonlinear, autocatalytic production and Fickian diffusion of H2O2 followed by first order decay well describes the spatial and temporal properties of the waveform. The reaction–diffusion system is analyzed in terms of a new approximate solution that we introduce for such problems based on a single term logistic function ansatz. The theory is able to describe experimental ROS waveforms and degradation dynamics such that species-dependent dimensionless wave velocities are revealed, corresponding to subtle changes in higher moments of the waveform through an apparently conserved signaling mechanism overall. This theory has utility in potentially decoding other stress signaling waveforms for light, heat and PAMP-induced stresses that are similarly under investigation. The approximate solution may also find use in applied agricultural sensing, facilitating the connection between measured waveform and plant physiology.",

An identifiability theorem, that most features of the unrooted tree of blobs can be determined from the distribution of gene quartet topologies, is established.

Thus, an important problem in mathematical modeling is to connect ecology, evolution and genetics, which often have been treated separately. Here, extending analysis of multiple virus and immune response populations in a resource—prey (consumer)—predator model from Browne and Smith (2018), we show that long term dynamics of viral mutants evolving resistance at distinct epitopes (viral proteins targeted by immune responses) are governed by epistasis in the virus fitness landscape. In particular, the stability of persistent equilibrium virus-immune (prey-predator) network structures, such as nested and one-to-one, and bifurcations are determined by a collection of circuits defined by combinations of viral fitnesses that are minimally additive within a hypercube of binary sequences representing all possible viral epitope sequences ordered according to immunodominance hierarchy. Numerical solutions of our ordinary differential equation system, along with an extended stochastic version including random mutation, demonstrate how pairwise or multiplicative epistatic interactions shape viral evolution against concurrent immune responses and convergence to the multi-variant steady state predicted by theoretical results. Furthermore, simulations illustrate how periodic infusions of subdominant immune responses can induce a bifurcation in the persistent viral strains, offering superior host outcome over an alternative strategy of immunotherapy with strongest immune response.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe interferential current (IFC) therapy is a noninvasive electrical neurostimulation technique intended to activate deep neurons using surface electrodes. In IFC, two independent kilohertz-frequency currents purportedly intersect where an interference field is generated. However, the effects of IFC on neurons within and outside the interference field are not completely understood, and it is unclear whether this technique can reliable activate deep target neurons without side effects. In recent years, realistic computational models of IFC have been introduced to quantify the effects of IFC on brain cells, but they are often complex and computationally costly. Here, we introduce a simplified model of IFC based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model of a neuron. By considering a modified averaging method, we obtain a non-autonomous approximated system, with explicit representation of relevant IFC parameters. For this approximated system we determine conditions under which it reliably approximates the complete FHN system under IFC stimulation, and we mathematically prove its ability to predict nonspiking states. In addition, we perform numerical simulations that show that the interference effect is observed only for a narrow set of IFC parameters and, in particular, for a beat frequency no higher than about 100 [Hz]. Our novel model tailored to the IFC technique contributes to the understanding of neurostimulation modalities using this type of signals, and can have implications in the design of noninvasive electrical stimulation therapies.",

The age of a tumor at diagnosis is typically unknown. Therefore, the quantity of interest is the time-marginal distribution over all possible genotypes of tumors, defined as the transient distribution integrated over an exponentially distributed observation time. It can be obtained as the solution of a large linear system. However, the sheer size of this system renders classical solvers infeasible. We consider Markov chains whose transition rates are separable functions, allowing for an efficient low-rank tensor representation of the linear system’s operator. Thus we can reduce the computational complexity from exponential to linear. We derive a convergent iterative method using low-rank formats whose result satisfies the normalization constraint of a distribution. We also perform numerical experiments illustrating that the marginal distribution is well approximated with low rank.",

Under the assumption that chemo-attractive coefficient is asymptotically large, we construct the single boundary spike and next show this non-constant steady state is locally linear stable via Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction method.

We address the question of how the population size and environmental heterogeneity impact the persistence and extinction of the disease when the diffusion rates approach zero. In particular, we show that there is a sharp critical number which depends delicately on the infected groups’ diffusion rates and each strain’s spatially heterogeneous infection and recovery rates. Moreover, if the total size of the population is kept below this critical number, then the disease could be eradicated by restricting the susceptible hosts’ movement . However, if the total population exceeds this critical number, the disease may persist no matter how the movement of the susceptible hosts is controlled. Additionally, our results suggest that the disease may persist if the diffusion rates of the infected groups are kept sufficiently smaller than that of the susceptible group.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe emergence and persistence of polymorphism within populations generally requires specific regimes of natural or sexual selection. Here, we develop a unified theoretical framework to explore how polymorphism at targeted loci can be generated and maintained by either disassortative mating choice or balancing selection due to, for example, heterozygote advantage. To this aim, we model the dynamics of alleles at a single locus A in a population of haploid individuals, where reproductive success depends on the combination of alleles carried by the parents at locus A. Our theoretical study of the model confirms that the conditions for the persistence of a given level of allelic polymorphism depend on the relative reproductive advantages among pairs of individuals. Interestingly, equilibria with unbalanced allelic frequencies were shown to emerge from successive introduction of mutants. We then investigate the role of the function linking allelic divergence to reproductive advantage on the evolutionary fate of alleles within the population. Our results highlight the significance of the shape of this function for both the number of alleles maintained and their level of genetic divergence. Large number of alleles are maintained with substantial replacement of alleles, when disassortative advantage slowly increases with allelic differentiation . In contrast, few highly differentiated alleles are predicted to be maintained when genetic differentiation has a strong effect on disassortative advantage. These opposite effects predicted by our model explain how disassortative mate choice may lead to various levels of allelic differentiation and polymorphism, and shed light on the effect of mate preferences on the persistence of balanced and unbalanced polymorphism in natural population.",

          "description": "Abstract\nCancer is usually considered a genetic disease caused by alterations in genes that control cellular behaviors, especially growth and division. Cancer cells differ from normal tissue cells in many ways that allow them to grow out of control and become invasive. However, experiments have shown that aberrant growth in many tissues burdened with varying numbers of mutant cells can be corrected, and wild-type cells are required for the active elimination of mutant cells. These findings reveal the dynamic cellular behaviors that lead to a tissue homeostatic state when faced with mutational and nonmutational insults. The current study was motivated by these observations and established a mathematical model of how a tissue copes with the aberrant behavior of mutant cells. The proposed model depicts the interaction between wild-type and mutant cells through a system of two delay differential equations, which include the random mutation of normal cells and the active extrusion of mutant cells. Based on the proposed model, we performed qualitative analysis to identify the conditions of either normal tissue homeostasis or uncontrolled growth with varying numbers of abnormal mutant cells. Bifurcation analysis suggests the conditions of bistability with either a small or large number of mutant cells, the coexistence of bistable steady states can be clinically beneficial by driving the state of mutant cell predominance to the attraction basin of the state with a low number of mutant cells. This result is further confirmed by the treatment strategy obtained from optimal control theory.",

          "description": "Abstract\nElectrical stimulation of peripheral nerve fibers has always been an attractive field of research. Due to the higher activation threshold, the stimulation of small fibers is accompanied by the stimulation of larger ones. It is therefore necessary to design a specific stimulation theme in order to only activate narrow fibers. There is evidence that stimulating Aδ fibers can activate endogenous pain-relieving mechanisms. However, both selective stimulation and reducing pain by activating small nociceptive fibers are still poorly investigated. In this study, using high-frequency stimulation waveforms (5–20 kHz), computational modeling provides a simple framework for activating narrow nociceptive fibers. Additionally, a model of myelinated nerve fibers is modified by including sodium–potassium pump and investigating its effects on neuronal stimulation. Besides, a modified mathematical model of pain processing circuits in the dorsal horn is presented that consists of supraspinal pain control mechanisms. Hence, by employing this pain-modulating model, the mechanism of the reduction of pain by activating nociceptive fibers is explored. In the case of two fibers with the same distance from the point source electrode, a single stimulation waveform is capable of blocking one large fiber and stimulating another small fiber. Noteworthy, the Na/K pump model demonstrated that it does not have a significant effect on the activation threshold and firing frequency of fiber. Ultimately, results suggest that the descending pathways of Locus coeruleus may effectively contribute to pain relief through stimulation of nociceptive fibers, which will be beneficial for clinical interventions.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe shape of cells and the control thereof plays a central role in a variety of cellular processes, including endo- and exocytosis, cell division and cell movement. Intra- and extracellular forces control the shapes, and while the shape changes in some processes such as exocytosis are intracellularly-controlled and localized in the cell, movement requires force transmission to the environment, and the feedback from it can affect the cell shape and mode of movement used. The shape of a cell is determined by its cytoskeleton (CSK), and thus shape changes involved in various processes involve controlled remodeling of the CSK. While much is known about individual components involved in these processes, an integrated understanding of how intra- and extracellular signals are coupled to the control of the mechanical changes involved is not at hand for any of them. As a first step toward understanding the interaction between intracellular forces imposed on the membrane and cell shape, we investigate the role of distributed surrogates for cortical forces in producing the observed three-dimensional shapes. We show how different balances of applied forces lead to such shapes, that there are different routes to the same end state, and that state transitions between axisymmetric shapes need not all be axisymmetric. Examples of the force distributions that lead to protrusions are given, and the shape changes induced by adhesion of a cell to a surface are studied. The results provide a reference framework for developing detailed models of intracellular force distributions observed experimentally, and provide a basis for studying how movement of a cell in a tissue or fluid is influenced by its shape.",

          "description": "Abstract\nA posteriori upper and lower bounds are derived for the linear finite element method (FEM) for the Helmholtz equation with large wavenumber. It is proved rigorously that the standard residual type error estimator seriously underestimates the true error of the FE solution for the mesh size h in the preasymptotic regime, which is first observed by Babuška et al. (Int J Numer Methods Eng 40:3443–3462, 1997) for a one dimensional problem. By establishing an equivalence relationship between the error estimators for the FE solution and the corresponding elliptic projection of the exact solution, an adaptive algorithm is proposed and its convergence and quasi-optimality are proved under the condition that \n                      \n                      \\(k^3h_0^{1+\\alpha }\\)\n                      \n                     is sufficiently small, where k is the wavenumber, \n                      \n                      \\(h_0\\)\n                      \n                     is the initial mesh size, and \n                      \n                      \\(\\frac{1}{2}<\\alpha \\le 1\\)\n                      \n                     is a regularity constant depending on the maximum reentrant angle of the domain. Numerical tests are given to verify the theoretical findings and to show that the adaptive continuous interior penalty finite element method (CIP-FEM) with appropriately selected penalty parameters can greatly reduce the pollution error and hence the residual type error estimator for this CIP-FEM is reliable and efficient even in the preasymptotic regime.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe problem of blind ptychography is to determine the specimen object and the scanning probe simultaneously from diffraction data. By formulating the problem as a nonconvex optimization, we propose linearized alternating direction method of multipliers (LADMM) to effectively solve the blind ptychography problem. Different from the iterative ptychographic engines (including ePIE, rPIE and other variants), all of the diffraction patterns are simultaneously exploited in our optimization based approach to address the ill-posedness of the problem. Compared to the existing ADMM-type algorithm in the literature (Chang et al. in SIAM J Imaging Sci 12(1):153–185, 2019), ours is based on a new splitting form for the bilinear term, which enables closed-form solutions for each subproblem. Convergence to stationary point of the considered optimization is provided under certain assumptions. It is observed that the performance of ADMM-type method highly depends on the penalty parameter. Thus LADMM with adaptive penalty parameter is developed to prioritize the reconstruction performance and have empirical convergence guarantee. With numerical comparison to other competitive algorithms, our proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art ones on simulated and experimental data, especially for the only limited available diffraction data case, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe develop a simple and efficient dimension splitting method for solving time dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) on multiple space dimensional irregular domains using a one dimensional kernel-free boundary integral (KFBI) method. The proposed method extends the alternating direction implicit methods and locally one dimensional methods to more general cases involving complex geometry. The KFBI method is a potential theory based Cartesian grid method, which works as an improvement of conventional boundary integral methods. In the KFBI method, boundary or volume integrals are evaluated by solving equivalent interface problems without using any analytic expression of Green’s functions. The one dimensional interface problems after dimension splitting are solved by finite difference method. The resulting linear systems are tri-diagonal and efficiently solved by the Thomas algorithm. The one dimensional kernel-free boundary integral method is rigorously proved to have second-order convergence rate in the maximum norm. Multiple numerical examples, including different types of PDEs and a free boundary problem, are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. Numerical results show that the proposed method is efficient and achieves overall second order accuracy.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we extend the positivity-preserving, entropy stable first-order scheme developed for the one-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes equations in Upperman et al. (J Comput Phys 466, 2022) to three spatial dimensions. The new first-order scheme is provably entropy stable, design-order accurate for smooth solutions, and guarantees the pointwise positivity of thermodynamic variables for 3-D compressible viscous flows. Similar to the 1-D counterpart, the proposed scheme for the 3-D Navier–Stokes equations is discretized on Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto grids used for high-order spectral collocation methods. The positivity of density is achieved by adding an artificial dissipation in the form of the first-order Brenner–Navier–Stokes diffusion operator. Another distinctive feature of the proposed scheme is that the Navier–Stokes viscous terms are discretized by high-order spectral collocation summation-by-parts operators. To eliminate time step stiffness caused by the high-order approximation of the viscous terms and the temperature positivity constraint, the velocity and temperature limiters developed for the 1-D compressible Navier–Stokes equations in Upperman et al. (J. Comput. Phys., 466, 2022) are generalized to three spatial dimensions. These limiters bound the magnitude of velocity and temperature gradients and preserve the entropy stability and positivity properties of the baseline scheme. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate design-order accuracy and positivity-preserving properties of the new first-order scheme for 2-D and 3-D inviscid and viscous flows with strong shocks and contact discontinuities.",

          "description": "Abstract\nAccurate simulations of the Stokes–Darcy system face many difficulties including the coupling of flows in two different subdomains via interface conditions, the incompressibility constraint for the free flow and uncertainties in model parameters. In this report, we propose and study efficient, decoupled, artificial compressibility (AC) ensemble schemes based on a recently developed SAV approach for fast computation of Stokes–Darcy flow ensembles. The proposed algorithms (1) do not require any time step condition and (2) decouple the computation of the velocity and pressure in the free flow region, and (3) result in a common coefficient matrix for all realizations after spatial discretization for which efficient iterative linear solvers such as block CG or block GMRES can be used to greatly reduce the computational cost. We prove the long time stability under two parameter conditions, without any timestep constraints. In particular, for one single simulation, they are unconditionally stable schemes. Several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithms and illustrate their applications in realistic flow problems.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe quantized neural network is a common way to improve inference and memory efficiency for deep learning methods. However, it is challenging to solve this optimization problem with good generalization due to its high nonlinearity and nonconvexity. This paper proposes an algorithm to train one-bit quantization neural networks based on sharpness-aware minimization Foret et al. (Sharpness-aware minimization for efficiently improving generalization, 2021) with two types of gradient approximation. The idea is to improve the generalization by finding a local minimum of a flat landscape of both continuous and quantized neural network loss. The convergence theory is partially established under a one-bit quantization setting. Experiments on the CIFAR-10 Krizhevsky (Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images, 2009) and SVHN Netzer et al. (Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning, 2011) datasets show improvement in generalization with the proposed algorithm compared to other state-of-the-art quantized training methods.",

However, the scheme is not scale-invariant and generates numerical oscillations near strong shocks. To overcome this issue, we design the scale-invariant Si-weights and the MR-AWENO-Si operator by including the new global smoothness indicator and the descaler. The resulting scale-invariant MR-AWENO-Si scheme captures discontinuity of any scale in the essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) way efficiently and robustly. We also demonstrate an interesting application of the scale-invariant scheme to achieve the well-balanced property for the compressible Euler equations under a gravitational potential field by modifying the numerical fluxes, reformulating the source terms, and enforcing the MR-AWENO-Si operator. A theoretical proof is given, and extensive one- and two-dimensional classical examples are used to verify the performance of the MR-AWENO-Si scheme in terms of accuracy, robustness, and well-balanced property.",

          "description": "Abstract\nReduced-order modelling and low-dimensional surrogate models generated using machine learning algorithms have been widely applied in high-dimensional dynamical systems to improve the algorithmic efficiency. In this paper, we develop a system which combines reduced-order surrogate models with a novel data assimilation (DA) technique used to incorporate real-time observations from different physical spaces. We make use of local smooth surrogate functions which link the space of encoded system variables and the one of current observations to perform variational DA with a low computational cost. The new system, named generalised latent assimilation can benefit both the efficiency provided by the reduced-order modelling and the accuracy of data assimilation. A theoretical analysis of the difference between surrogate and original assimilation cost function is also provided in this paper where an upper bound, depending on the size of the local training set, is given. The new approach is tested on a high-dimensional (CFD) application of a two-phase liquid flow with non-linear observation operators that current Latent Assimilation methods can not handle. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed assimilation approach can significantly improve the reconstruction and prediction accuracy of the deep learning surrogate model which is nearly 1000 times faster than the CFD simulation.",

The quasi-entropy is a strictly convex, rotationally invariant elementary function, giving a singular potential constraining the eigenvalues of Q within the physical range \n                      \n                      \\((-1/3,2/3)\\)\n                      \n                    . Compared with the potential derived from the Bingham distribution, the quasi-entropy has the same asymptotic behavior and underlying physics. Meanwhile, it is very easy to evaluate because of its simple expression. For the elastic energy, we include all the rotationally invariant terms. The numerical schemes for the gradient flow are built on the nice properties of the quasi-entropy. The first-order time discretization is uniquely solvable, keeping the physical constraints and energy dissipation, which are all independent of the time step. The second-order time discretization keeps the first two properties unconditionally, and the third with an O(1) restriction on the time step. These results also hold when we further incorporate a second-order discretization in space. Error estimates are also established for time discretization and full discretization. Numerical examples about defect patterns are presented to validate the theoretical results.",

In this paper, we study the generalized multiscale finite element method (GMsFEM) for single phase compressible flow in highly heterogeneous porous media. We follow the major steps of the GMsFEM to construct a permeability dependent offline basis for fast coarse-grid simulation. The offline coarse space is efficiently constructed only once based on the initial permeability field with parallel computing. A rigorous convergence analysis is performed for two types of snapshot spaces. The analysis indicates that the convergence rates of the proposed multiscale method depend on the coarse meshsize and the eigenvalue decay of the local spectral problem. To further increase the accuracy of the multiscale method, a residual driven online multiscale basis is added to the offline space. The construction of an online multiscale basis is based on a carefully designed error indicator motivated by the analysis. We find that an online basis is particularly important for the singular source. Rich numerical tests on typical 3D highly heterogeneous media are presented to demonstrate the impressive computational advantages of the proposed multiscale method.",

Small-scale features of shallow water flow obtained from direct numerical simulation (DNS) with two different computational codes for the shallow water equations are gathered offline and subsequently employed with the aim of constructing a reduced-order correction. This is used to facilitate high-fidelity online flow predictions at much reduced costs on coarse meshes. The resolved small-scale features at high resolution represent subgrid properties for the coarse representation. Measurements of the subgrid dynamics are obtained as the difference between the evolution of a coarse grid solution and the corresponding DNS result. The measurements are sensitive to the particular numerical methods used for the simulation on coarse computational grids and can be used to approximately correct the associated discretization errors. The subgrid features are decomposed into empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), after which a corresponding correction term is constructed. By increasing the number of EOFs in the approximation of the measured values the correction term can in principle be made arbitrarily accurate. Both computational methods investigated here show a significant decrease in the simulation error already when applying the correction based on the dominant EOFs only. The error reduction accounts for the particular discretization errors that are incurred and are hence specific to the particular simulation method that is adopted. This improvement is also observed for very coarse grids, which may be used for computational model reduction in geophysical and turbulent flow problems.",

Triadic closure describes the tendency for new friendships to form between individuals who already have friends in common. It has been argued heuristically that the triadic closure effect can lead to bistability in the formation of large-scale social interaction networks. Here, depending on the initial state and the transient dynamics, the system may evolve towards either of two long-time states. In this work, we propose and study a hierarchy of network evolution models that incorporate triadic closure, building on the work of Grindrod, Higham, and Parsons [Internet Math., 8 (2012), pp. 402–423]. We use a chemical kinetics framework, paying careful attention to the reaction rate scaling with respect to the system size. In a macroscale regime, we show rigorously that a bimodal steady state distribution is admitted. This behavior corresponds to the existence of two distinct stable fixed points in a deterministic mean-field ODE. The macroscale model is also seen to capture an apparent metastability property of the microscale system. Computational simulations are used to support the analysis.",

This article examines the homogenization issue for the Stokes system in a domain with an oscillating boundary portion. On the oscillating boundary, we impose inhomogeneous oscillating Dirichlet boundary data. The proposed method is an attempt to develop the homogenization technique for the nonstationary Stokes system on noncylindrical domains. To resolve the uniform bound of solutions with respect to heterogeneous parameters, we transform the system into a reference domain and demonstrate its existence and uniqueness in the reference domain. In order to homogenize the velocity and pressure in the reference domain, two-scale convergence is employed. In contrast to all other available homogenization techniques, the one presented in this work is easily adaptable to evolving domains. We also establish error estimates for the homogenized system approximation by transforming the system into its initial configuration.",

This study constructs a new diffuse-domain (DD) lattice Boltzmann (LB) method for two-phase flows in complex geometries. We first coupled the DD method with the consistent and conservative phase-field (CCPF) method which can be described by the DD-CC Navier–Stokes–Cahn–Hilliard (NSCH) equations with the consistency of reduction, the consistency of mass and momentum transport, and the consistency of mass conservation. Then we conducted a matched asymptotic analysis and found that the DD-CCNSCH equations would converge to the CCNSCH equations as the thickness of the DD interface approaches to zero. Since the boundary conditions imposed on the complex geometries are incorporated into the DD-CCNSCH equations as the source terms, the system can be implemented more readily in a large and regular domain, and there is no need to treat the complex boundary conditions specially. We further developed a DD-CCPFLB method, and through the Chapman–Enskog analysis, the DD-CCPFLB method can correctly recover the DD-CCNSCH equations for two-phase flows in complex geometries. To quantitatively validate the DD-CCPFLB method, three benchmark problems are considered, and the numerical results are in agreement with those obtained through directly solving the CCNSCH equations combined with the original boundary conditions, the analytical solution, or the reported data. Finally, the present method is used to study the problems of two-phase flows in complex geometries, including the droplet dynamics in the Y-shaped channel and a droplet passing through cylindrical obstacles. The effects of the wettability and viscosity ratio are mainly investigated, and it is found that these two factors have significant impacts on the droplet dynamics.",

We present a geometric Melnikov method to analyze a two-dimensional stable or unstable manifold associated with a saddle point in three-dimensional nonvolume preserving autonomous flows. The time-varying perturbed location of such a manifold is obtained under very general, nonvolume preserving and with arbitrary time-dependence, perturbations. We demonstrate the explicit computability of the leading-order spatio-temporal location of the manifold using our formulas. In unperturbed situations with a two-dimensional heteroclinic manifold, we adapt our theory to quantify the splitting into a stable and unstable manifold, and thereby obtain an instantaneous flux quantification in terms of a Melnikov function. The time-varying instantaneous flux theory does not require any intersections between perturbed manifolds, nor rely on descriptions of lobe dynamics. Our theory has specific application to transport in fluid mechanics, where the flow is in three dimensions and flow separators in forward/backward time are two-dimensional stable/unstable manifolds. We demonstrate our theory using both the classical and swirling versions of Hill’s spherical vortex.",

Koopman operator theory has gained interest in the past decade as a framework for rigorously transforming nonlinear dynamics on the state space into linear dynamics on Koopman-invariant function spaces. These Koopman-invariant spaces can be approximated purely through data-driven methodologies, which then enables future state prediction and the application of classical linear control to strongly nonlinear systems. Recently in literature, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) was developed for systems represented through eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator. However, the controller was limited to using real-valued eigenfunctions for conservative systems. In this paper, we extend the Koopman LQR framework to use multiple complex eigenfunctions. We illustrate in several examples that our proposed extension enables Koopman LQR to control dissipative systems and to drive different nonlinear oscillators to stabilize at nonequilibrium points and follow arbitrarily prescribed targets, which was not possible using a single real-valued Koopman eigenfunction.",

We analyze a family of clustered excitatory-inhibitory neural networks and the underlying bifurcation structures that arise because of permutation symmetries in the network as the global coupling strength [math] is varied. We primarily consider two network topologies: an all-to-all connected network which excludes self-connections, and a network in which the excitatory cells are broken into clusters of equal size. Although in both cases the bifurcation structure is determined by symmetries in the system, the behavior of the two systems is qualitatively different. In the all-to-all connected network, the system undergoes Hopf bifurcations leading to periodic orbit solutions; notably, for large [math], there is a single, stable periodic orbit solution and no stable fixed points. By contrast, in the clustered network, there are no Hopf bifurcations, and there is a family of stable fixed points for large [math].",

However, many bump attractor models collapse these subpopulations into a single joint E/I(lateral inhibitory) population and do not consider the role of interpopulation neural architecture and noise correlations. Both factors have a high potential to impinge upon the stochastic dynamics of these bumps, ultimately shaping behavioral response variance. In our study, we consider a neural field model with separate E/I populations and leverage asymptotic analysis to derive a nonlinear Langevin system describing E/I bump interactions. While the E bump attracts the I bump, the I bump stabilizes but can also repel the E bump, which can result in prolonged relaxation dynamics when both bumps are perturbed. Furthermore, the structure of noise correlations within and between subpopulations strongly shapes the variance in bump position. Surprisingly, higher interpopulation correlations reduce variance.",

Significant past work has characterized properties of canard solutions, which spend unexpectedly long times near dynamically unstable manifolds in the phase space of an underlying dynamical system. We have recently introduced techniques to identify and analyze rivers, which are a class of trajectories that can serve as transient attractors in phase space. In this work, after generalizing the concept of rivers to arbitrary dimensions and introducing a classification of rivers, we show that maximal canards in systems with one fast and two slow variables are rivers of infinite order, or river canards. We use this relationship to provide new insights about how nearby trajectories behave and about how river canards organize the flow near the fold of a critical manifold. This analysis includes the calculation of the way-in way-out function, which provides an estimate for the extent of the delay in escape that trajectories experience when passing near the fold of a critical manifold with canard dynamics, without the need for complexification of time. We also illustrate our results for the well-known autocatalator system.",

We show the asymptotic stability of the network for parameter values in a range compatible with both population and game dynamics. We obtain estimates of the relative attractiveness of each one of the cycles by computing their stability indices. For the parameter values ensuring the asymptotic stability of the network we relate the attractiveness properties of each cycle to the others. In particular, for three of the cycles we show that if one of them has a weak form of attractiveness, then the other two are completely unstable.

Particles suspended in fluid flow through a curved duct focus to stable equilibrium positions in the duct cross-section due to the balance of two dominant forces: (i) inertial lift force, arising from the inertia of the fluid, and (ii) secondary drag force, resulting from cross-sectional vortices induced by the curvature of the duct. Such particle focusing is exploited in various medical and industrial technologies aimed at separating particles by size. Using the theoretical model developed by Harding, Stokes, and Bertozzi [J. Fluid Mech., 875 (2019), pp. 1–43], we numerically investigate the dynamics of neutrally buoyant particles in fluid flow through curved ducts with rectangular cross-sections at low flow rates. We explore the rich bifurcations that take place in the particle equilibria as a function of three system parameters—particle size, duct bend radius, and aspect ratio of the cross-section. We also explore the transient dynamics of particles as they focus to their equilibria by delineating the effects of these three parameters, as well as the initial location of the particle inside the cross-section, on the focusing dynamics.",

We develop a simple financial market model in which a market maker adjusts the price with respect to orders placed by chartists and fundamentalists. A novel feature of our model is that fundamentalists optimistically (pessimistically) believe in a relatively high (low) fundamental value when the financial market is increasing (decreasing). As it turns out, the dynamics of our model is driven by a two-dimensional discontinuous piecewise linear map for which we provide an in-depth analytical and numerical investigation. Among other things, we obtain in explicit form the boundaries of the periodicity regions associated with attracting cycles with rotation number [math], [math] These boundaries correspond to border collision bifurcations of the related cycles. We show that the periodicity regions are organized in a specific period adding structure, and some of the regions may overlap.

We prove that, in many cases, wave dynamics can be fully reconstructed from a single sensor, but that such reconstructions can be sensitive to small perturbations in sensor placement. In general, multiple sensors are necessary, and we outline a procedure for reconstructing the dynamics from them.

While a common trend in disease modeling is to develop models of increasing complexity, it was recently pointed out that outbreaks appear remarkably simple when viewed in the incidence vs. cumulative cases (ICC) plane. This article details the theory behind this phenomenon by analyzing the stochastic Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model in the cumulative cases domain. We prove that the Markov chain associated with this model reduces, in the ICC plane, to a pure birth chain for the cumulative number of cases, whose limit leads to an independent increments Gaussian process that fluctuates about a deterministic ICC curve. We calculate the associated variance and quantify the additional variability due to estimating incidence over a finite period of time. We also illustrate the universality brought forth by the ICC concept on real-world data for Influenza A and for the COVID-19 outbreak in Arizona.",

We call the new characterizations harmonic GPTs (HGPTs) as their coefficients correspond to products of harmonic polynomials. Then, we show that the number of independent coefficients of HGPTs needed to characterize objects can be significantly reduced by considering the symmetry group of the object and propose a systematic approach for determining the subspace of symmetric harmonic polynomials that is fixed by the group and its dimension.

Its quantitative understanding is highly relevant for the treatment of various diseases, including blood cancers. White blood cells (WBCs) originate from the so-called hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population. HSCs give rise to immature WBCs that divide and further differentiate into mature cells. It is still a matter of debate whether cell differentiation resembles a discrete or a continuous process. We propose a novel continuous integral model (CIM) to describe WBC production. In agreement with recent experimental results, the maturity level of cells is described by a one-dimensional continuous variable. The process of maturation is modeled by an integral term that accounts for the influx of cells of maturity level [math] from the differentiation of cells with lower maturity levels. In the model, cell proliferation and differentiation are controlled by a feedback signal which is a function of the mature cell population. We investigate the relationships between the proposed CIM, the multicompartment ordinary differential equations model introduced in [A. Marciniak-Czochra et al., Stem Cells Dev., 18 (2009), pp. 377–385] which treats differentiation as a discrete process, and the partial differential equations model of transport type studied by Doumic et al. [SIAM J. Appl. Math., 71 (2011), pp. 1918–1940] which describes differentiation as a continuous process. We show that both models can be derived from the CIM and we perform numerical simulations to compare them qualitatively.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. Circadian oscillations have been reported in major renal functions such as renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary excretion. These oscillations can be explained, in part, by the rhythmic variations in renal transporter expressions. However, given that a multitude of renal transporters are regulated by the circadian clock, and that the functions of some of these transporters are coupled, the underlying mechanisms that link variations in transporter expression to the observed changes in kidney function have yet to be fully elucidated. To better understand the impact of the circadian clock on renal solute and water transport, we have developed a computational model of the epithelial transport of the rat kidney that represents the observed rhythmic variations in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and in the activities of Na+/H+ exchanger 3, sodium-gLucose cotransporter 1, epithelial Na+ channels, pendrin, and renal outer-medullary K+ channels. The model predicts the rhythmic oscillations in GFR and key renal transporter activities give rise to a significant shift in transport loads among different nephron segments. Together, these oscillations yield 3-4-fold daily fluctuations in urine output and urinary electrolyte excretion rates.",

For this reason, it has recently been proposed that the spread of information, opinion, or disease should be modeled over a hypergraph rather than a standard graph. The use of hyperedges naturally allows for a nonlinear rate of transmission, in terms of both the group size and the number of infected group members, as is the case, for example, when social distancing is encouraged. We consider a general class of individual-level, stochastic, susceptible-infected-susceptible models on a hypergraph, and focus on a mean field approximation proposed in [G. F. de Arruda, G. Petri, and Y. Moreno, Phys. Rev. Res., 2 (2020), 023032]. We derive spectral conditions under which the mean field model predicts local or global stability of the infection-free state. We also compare these results with (a) a new condition that we derive for decay to zero in mean for the exact process, (b) conditions for a different mean field approximation in [D. J.

We consider a jump-diffusion process on a bounded domain with reflection at the boundary and establish long-term results for a general additive process of its path. This includes the long-term behavior of its occupation time in the interior and on the boundaries. We derive a characterization of the large deviation rate function which quantifies the rate of exponential decay of probabilities of rare events for paths of the process. The characterization relies on a solution of a partial integro-differential equation with boundary constraints. We develop a practical implementation of our results in terms of a numerical solution for the PIDE. We illustrate the method on a few standard examples (Brownian motion, birth-death processes) and on a particular jump-diffusion model arising from applications to biochemical reactions.",

Networks are a widely used tool for investigating the large-scale connectivity structure in complex systems and graphons have been proposed as an infinite-size limit of dense networks. The detection of communities or other meso-scale structures is a prominent topic in network science as it allows the identification of functional building blocks in complex systems. Similarly, we may want to simplify graphons in terms of communities, in order to gain a comprehensible description of their meso-scale structure. This raises the question of how communities in graphons can be identified. In this paper, we define a graphon modularity and demonstrate that it can be maximized to detect communities in graphons. We then investigate specific synthetic graphons and show that they may show a wide range of different community structures. We also reformulate the graphon-modularity maximization as a continuous optimization problem and so prove the optimal community structure or lack thereof for some graphons, something that is usually not possible for networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that estimating a graphon from network data as an intermediate step can improve the detection of communities, in comparison with exclusively maximizing the modularity of the network. While the choice of graphon estimator may strongly influence the accord between the community structure of a network and its estimated graphon, we find that there is a substantial overlap if an appropriate estimator is used. Our study demonstrates that community detection for graphons is possible and may serve as a privacy-preserving way to cluster network data.",

A program obfuscator takes a program and outputs a “scrambled” version of it, where the goal is that the obfuscated program will not reveal much about its structure beyond what is apparent from executing it. There are several ways of formalizing this goal. Specifically, in indistinguishability obfuscation, first defined by Barak et al. [Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO, 2001, Lect. Notes Comput. Sci. 2139, Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, pp. 1–18], the requirement is that the results of obfuscating any two functionally equivalent programs (circuits) will be computationally indistinguishable.

Load balancing is a well-studied problem, with balls-in-bins being the primary framework. The greedy algorithm [math] of Azar et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 29 (1999), pp. 180–200] places each ball by probing [math] random bins and placing the ball in the least loaded of them. With high probability, the maximum load under [math] is exponentially lower than the result when balls are placed uniformly randomly. Vöcking [J. ACM, 50 (2003), pp. 568–589] showed that a slightly asymmetric variant, [math], provides a further significant improvement. However, this improvement comes at the additional computational cost of imposing structure on the bins. Here, we present a fully decentralized and easy-to-implement algorithm called [math] that combines the simplicity of [math] and the improved balance of [math]. The key idea in [math] is to probe until a different bin size from the first observation is located and then place the ball. Although the number of probes could be quite large for some of the balls, we show that [math] requires only at most [math] probes on average per ball (in both the standard and the heavily loaded settings). Thus the number of probes is no greater than that of either [math] or [math]. More importantly, we show that [math] closely matches the improved maximum load ensured by [math] in both the standard and heavily loaded settings. We further provide a tight lower bound on the maximum load up to [math] terms. We additionally give experimental data that [math] is indeed as good as [math], if not better, in practice.",

Given a planar graph [math] and an integer [math], it is possible in polynomial time to randomly sample a subset [math] of vertices of [math] with the following properties: [math] induces a subgraph of [math] of treewidth [math], and for every connected subgraph [math] of [math] on at most [math] vertices, the probability that [math] covers the whole vertex set of [math] is at least [math], where [math] is the number of vertices of [math]. Together with standard dynamic programming techniques for graphs of bounded treewidth, this result gives a versatile technique for obtaining (randomized) subexponential-time parameterized algorithms for problems on planar graphs, usually with running time bound [math]. The technique can be applied to problems expressible as searching for a small, connected pattern with a prescribed property in a large host graph; examples of such problems include Directed [math]-Path, Weighted [math]-Path, Vertex Cover Local Search, and Subgraph Isomorphism, among others. Up to this point, it was open whether these problems could be solved in subexponential parameterized time on planar graphs, because they are not amenable to the classic technique of bidimensionality. Furthermore, all our results hold in fact on any class of graphs that exclude a fixed apex graph as a minor, in particular on graphs embeddable in any fixed surface.",

Graph sparsification underlies a large number of algorithms, ranging from approximation algorithms for cut problems to solvers for linear systems in the graph Laplacian. In its strongest form, “spectral sparsification” reduces the number of edges to near-linear in the number of nodes, while approximately preserving the cut and spectral structure of the graph. In this work we demonstrate a polynomial quantum speedup for spectral sparsification and many of its applications. In particular, we give a quantum algorithm that, given a weighted graph with [math] nodes and [math] edges, outputs a classical description of an [math]-spectral sparsifier in sublinear time [math]. This contrasts with the optimal classical complexity [math]. We also prove that our quantum algorithm is optimal up to polylog-factors. The algorithm builds on a string of existing results on sparsification, graph spanners, quantum algorithms for shortest paths, and efficient constructions for [math]-wise independent random strings. Our algorithm implies a quantum speedup for solving Laplacian systems and for approximating a range of cut problems such as min cut and sparsest cut.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 51, Issue 6, Page 1796-1838, December 2022. \n Abstract. We present a general framework for designing approximately revenue-optimal mechanisms for multi-item additive auctions, which applies to both truthful and nontruthful auctions. Given a (not necessarily truthful) single-item auction format [math] satisfying certain technical conditions, we run simultaneous item auctions augmented with a personalized entry fee for each bidder that must be paid before the auction can be accessed. These entry fees depend only on the prior distribution of bidder types and in particular are independent of realized bids. We bound the revenue of the resulting two-part tariff mechanism using a novel geometric technique that enables revenue guarantees for many common nontruthful auctions that previously had none. Our approach adapts and extends the duality framework of Cai, Devanur, and Weinberg [SIAM J. Comput., 50 (2021), pp. STOC16-160–STOC16-200] beyond truthful auctions. Our framework can be used with many common auction formats, such as simultaneous first-price, simultaneous second-price, and simultaneous all-pay auctions. Our results for first-price and all-pay are the first revenue guarantees of nontruthful mechanisms in multidimensional environments, addressing an open question in the literature [T. Roughgarden, V. Syrgkanis, and E. Tardos, J. Artificial Intelligence Res., 59 (2017), pp. 59–101]. If all-pay auctions are used, we prove that the resulting mechanism is also credible in the sense that the auctioneer cannot benefit by deviating from the stated mechanism after observing agent bids. This is the first static credible mechanism for multi-item additive auctions that achieves a constant factor of the optimal revenue. If second-price auctions are used, we obtain a truthful [math]-approximate mechanism with fixed entry fees that are amenable to tuning via online learning techniques.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 51, Issue 6, Page 1839-1865, December 2022. \n Abstract. Locally correctable codes (LCCs) are error correcting codes [math] which admit local algorithms that correct any individual symbol of a corrupted codeword via a minuscule number of queries. For systematic codes, this notion is stronger than that of locally decodable codes (LDCs), where the goal is to only recover individual symbols of the message. One of the central problems in algorithmic coding theory is to construct [math]-query LCCs and LDCs with minimal block length. Alas, state-of-the-art of such codes requires super-polynomial block length to admit [math]-query algorithms for local correction and decoding, despite much attention during the last two decades. The study of relaxed LCCs and LDCs, which allow the correction algorithm to abort (but not err) on a small fraction of the locations, provides a way to circumvent this barrier. This relaxation turned out to allow constant-query correcting and decoding algorithms for codes with polynomial block length. Focusing on local correction, Gur, Ramnarayan, and Rothblum [Proceedings of the 9th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference, ITCS’18, 2018, pp. 1–27] showed that there exist [math]-query relaxed LCCs that achieve nearly-quartic block length [math], for an arbitrarily small constant [math]. We construct an [math]-query relaxed LCC with nearly-linear block length [math], for an arbitrarily small constant [math]. This significantly narrows the gap between the lower bound which states that there are no [math]-query relaxed LCCs with block length [math]. In particular, our construction matches the parameters achieved by Ben-Sasson et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 36 (2006), pp. 889–974], who constructed relaxed LDCs with the same parameters. This resolves an open problem raised by Gur, Ramnarayan, and Rothblum [Proceedings of the 9th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference, ITCS’18, 2018, pp. 1–27].",
