          "description": "Abstract\nA high-order finite-volume scheme with anisotropic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is combined with a parallel inexact Newton method for the solution of steady compressible fluid flows governed by the Euler and Navier–Stokes equations on three-dimensional multi-block body-fitted hexahedral meshes. The proposed steady flow solution method combines a family of robust and accurate high-order central essentially non-oscillatory (CENO) spatial discretization schemes with both a scalable and efficient Newton–Krylov–Schwarz (NKS) algorithm and a block-based anisotropic AMR method. The CENO scheme is based on a hybrid solution reconstruction procedure that provides high-order accuracy in smooth regions (even for smooth extrema) and non-oscillatory transitions at discontinuities and makes use of a high-order representation of the mesh and a high-order treatment of boundary conditions. In the proposed Newton method, the resulting linear systems of equations are solved using the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) algorithm preconditioned by a domain-based additive Schwarz technique. The latter uses the domain decomposition provided by the block-based AMR scheme leading to a fully parallel implicit approach with an efficient scalability of the overall scheme. The anisotropic AMR method is based on a binary tree data structure and permits local anisotropic refinement of the grid in preferred directions as directed by appropriately specified physics-based refinement criteria. Numerical results are presented for a range of inviscid and viscous steady problems and the computational performance of the combined scheme is demonstrated and assessed.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this work we study various continuous finite element discretization for two dimensional hyperbolic partial differential equations, varying the polynomial space (Lagrangian on equispaced, Lagrangian on quadrature points (Cubature) and Bernstein), the stabilization techniques (streamline-upwind Petrov–Galerkin, continuous interior penalty, orthogonal subscale stabilization) and the time discretization (Runge–Kutta (RK), strong stability preserving RK and deferred correction). This is an extension of the one dimensional study by Michel et al. (J Sci Comput 89(2):31, 2021. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-021-01632-7), whose results do not hold in multi-dimensional frameworks. The study ranks these schemes based on efficiency (most of them are mass-matrix free), stability and dispersion error, providing the best CFL and stabilization coefficients. The challenges in two-dimensions are related to the Fourier analysis. Here, we perform it on two types of periodic triangular meshes varying the angle of the advection, and we combine all the results for a general stability analysis. Furthermore, we introduce additional high order viscosity to stabilize the discontinuities, in order to show how to use these methods for tests of practical interest. All the theoretical results are thoroughly validated numerically both on linear and non-linear problems, and error-CPU time curves are provided. Our final conclusions suggest that Cubature elements combined with SSPRK and OSS stabilization is the most promising combination.",

The approximation of continuity equation is obtained by a piecewise constant discontinuous Galerkin method. The discretization of momentum equation is obtained by conforming Bernardi–Raugel finite elements. The convergence of mixed DG-FEM for nonlinear, isentropic stokes problem is rigorously established by compactness arguments and the existence analysis of Lions on the discrete level. Employing the continuous relative energy functional method and a detailed consistency analysis, we derive two error estimates for the numerical solution of the semi-stationary isentropic stokes system.

          "description": "Abstract\nTackling new machine learning problems with neural networks always means optimizing numerous hyperparameters that define their structure and strongly impact their performances. In this work, we study the use of goal-oriented sensitivity analysis, based on the Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC), for hyperparameter analysis and optimization. Hyperparameters live in spaces that are often complex and awkward. They can be of different natures (categorical, discrete, boolean, continuous), interact, and have inter-dependencies. All this makes it non-trivial to perform classical sensitivity analysis. We alleviate these difficulties to obtain a robust analysis index that is able to quantify hyperparameters’ relative impact on a neural network’s final error. This valuable tool allows us to better understand hyperparameters and to make hyperparameter optimization more interpretable. We illustrate the benefits of this knowledge in the context of hyperparameter optimization and derive an HSIC-based optimization algorithm that we apply on MNIST and Cifar, classical machine learning data sets, but also on the approximation of Runge function and Bateman equations solution, of interest for scientific machine learning. This method yields neural networks that are both competitive and cost-effective.",

We first reduce the problem in an exterior domain to a bounded domain using the exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. Next, we formulate the reduced problem into an equivalent problem in an annulus by using a fictitious domain approach. Then, we apply the Fourier-spectral method in the radial direction to reduce the problem in an annulus to a sequence of 1-D Bessel-type equations, each with a one-sided open boundary condition that are to be determined by the boundary condition of the original Helmholtz equation. We solve these 1-D Bessel-type equations by the Legendre-spectral method, and determine the open boundary conditions with a least square approach. We derive a wave number explicit error estimate for the special case of a circular obstacle, and provide ample numerical results to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a new class of high-order fast multi-resolution essentially non-oscillatory (FMRENO) schemes is proposed with an emphasis on both the performance and the computational efficiency. First, a new candidate stencil arrangement is developed for a multi-resolution representation of the local flow scales. A set of candidate stencils ranging from high- to low-order (from large to small stencils) is constructed in a hierarchical manner. Second, the monotonicity-preserving (MP) limiter is introduced as the regularity criterion of the candidate stencils. A candidate stencil, with which the reconstructed cell interface flux locates within the MP lower and upper bounds, is regarded to be smooth. Third, a multi-resolution stencil selection strategy, which prioritizes the stencils with better spectral property or higher-order accuracy meanwhile satisfying the MP criterion, is proposed. If all the candidate stencils are judged to be nonsmooth, the targeted stencil that violates the MP criterion the least is deployed as the final reconstruction instead. With this new framework, the desirable high-order accuracy is restored in the smooth regions while the sharp shock-capturing capability is achieved by selecting the targeted stencil satisfying the MP criterion most. Moreover, the new FMRENO schemes feature low numerical dissipation for resolving the broadband physical fluctuations by adaptively choosing the candidate stencil with better spectra or higher accuracy order based on the local flow regularity. Compared to the standard weighted/targeted essentially non-oscillatory (W/TENO) schemes, the computational efficiency is dramatically enhanced by avoiding the expensive evaluations of the classical smoothness indicators. A set of benchmark simulations demonstrate the performance of the new FMRENO schemes for handling complex fluid problems with a wide range of length scales.",

Then in the presented multigrid method, only one discrete linear boundary value problem needs to be solved for each level of the multigrid sequence. Because we avoid solving large-scale nonlinear eigenvalue problems directly, the overall efficiency is significantly improved. The optimal error estimate and linear computational complexity can be derived simultaneously. In addition, we also provide an improved multigrid method coupled with a mixing scheme to further guarantee the convergence and stability of the iteration scheme. More importantly, we prove convergence for the residuals after each iteration step. For nonlinear eigenvalue problems, such theoretical analysis is missing from the existing literatures on the mixing iteration scheme.",
