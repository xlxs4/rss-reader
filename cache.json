          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we study a mixed discontinuous Galerkin-finite element method (DG-FEM) for solving the semi-stationary compressible Stokes system in a bounded domain. The approximation of continuity equation is obtained by a piecewise constant discontinuous Galerkin method. The discretization of momentum equation is obtained by conforming Bernardi–Raugel finite elements. The convergence of mixed DG-FEM for nonlinear, isentropic stokes problem is rigorously established by compactness arguments and the existence analysis of Lions on the discrete level. Employing the continuous relative energy functional method and a detailed consistency analysis, we derive two error estimates for the numerical solution of the semi-stationary isentropic stokes system. In particular, we establish the \n                      \n                      \\(L^2\\)\n                      \n                     error estimates for the pressure.

          "description": "Abstract\nTackling new machine learning problems with neural networks always means optimizing numerous hyperparameters that define their structure and strongly impact their performances. In this work, we study the use of goal-oriented sensitivity analysis, based on the Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC), for hyperparameter analysis and optimization. Hyperparameters live in spaces that are often complex and awkward. They can be of different natures (categorical, discrete, boolean, continuous), interact, and have inter-dependencies. All this makes it non-trivial to perform classical sensitivity analysis. We alleviate these difficulties to obtain a robust analysis index that is able to quantify hyperparameters’ relative impact on a neural network’s final error. This valuable tool allows us to better understand hyperparameters and to make hyperparameter optimization more interpretable. We illustrate the benefits of this knowledge in the context of hyperparameter optimization and derive an HSIC-based optimization algorithm that we apply on MNIST and Cifar, classical machine learning data sets, but also on the approximation of Runge function and Bateman equations solution, of interest for scientific machine learning. This method yields neural networks that are both competitive and cost-effective.",

We first reduce the problem in an exterior domain to a bounded domain using the exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. Next, we formulate the reduced problem into an equivalent problem in an annulus by using a fictitious domain approach. Then, we apply the Fourier-spectral method in the radial direction to reduce the problem in an annulus to a sequence of 1-D Bessel-type equations, each with a one-sided open boundary condition that are to be determined by the boundary condition of the original Helmholtz equation. We solve these 1-D Bessel-type equations by the Legendre-spectral method, and determine the open boundary conditions with a least square approach. We derive a wave number explicit error estimate for the special case of a circular obstacle, and provide ample numerical results to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a new class of high-order fast multi-resolution essentially non-oscillatory (FMRENO) schemes is proposed with an emphasis on both the performance and the computational efficiency. First, a new candidate stencil arrangement is developed for a multi-resolution representation of the local flow scales. A set of candidate stencils ranging from high- to low-order (from large to small stencils) is constructed in a hierarchical manner. Second, the monotonicity-preserving (MP) limiter is introduced as the regularity criterion of the candidate stencils. A candidate stencil, with which the reconstructed cell interface flux locates within the MP lower and upper bounds, is regarded to be smooth. Third, a multi-resolution stencil selection strategy, which prioritizes the stencils with better spectral property or higher-order accuracy meanwhile satisfying the MP criterion, is proposed. If all the candidate stencils are judged to be nonsmooth, the targeted stencil that violates the MP criterion the least is deployed as the final reconstruction instead. With this new framework, the desirable high-order accuracy is restored in the smooth regions while the sharp shock-capturing capability is achieved by selecting the targeted stencil satisfying the MP criterion most. Moreover, the new FMRENO schemes feature low numerical dissipation for resolving the broadband physical fluctuations by adaptively choosing the candidate stencil with better spectra or higher accuracy order based on the local flow regularity. Compared to the standard weighted/targeted essentially non-oscillatory (W/TENO) schemes, the computational efficiency is dramatically enhanced by avoiding the expensive evaluations of the classical smoothness indicators. A set of benchmark simulations demonstrate the performance of the new FMRENO schemes for handling complex fluid problems with a wide range of length scales.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a novel multigrid method based on Newton iteration is proposed to solve nonlinear eigenvalue problems. Instead of handling the eigenvalue \n                      \n                      \\(\\lambda \\)\n                      \n                     and eigenfunction u separately, we treat the eigenpair \n                      \n                      \\((\\lambda , u)\\)\n                      \n                     as one element in a product space \n                      \n                      \\({\\mathbb {R}} \\times H_0^1(\\Omega )\\)\n                      \n                    . Then in the presented multigrid method, only one discrete linear boundary value problem needs to be solved for each level of the multigrid sequence. Because we avoid solving large-scale nonlinear eigenvalue problems directly, the overall efficiency is significantly improved. The optimal error estimate and linear computational complexity can be derived simultaneously. In addition, we also provide an improved multigrid method coupled with a mixing scheme to further guarantee the convergence and stability of the iteration scheme. More importantly, we prove convergence for the residuals after each iteration step. For nonlinear eigenvalue problems, such theoretical analysis is missing from the existing literatures on the mixing iteration scheme.",

Comparing with the traditional second-order SAV approach (Shen et al. in J Comput Phys 353:407–416, 2018), we only use a first-order method to approximate the auxiliary variable. This treatment does not affect the second-order accuracy of the unknown function \n                      \n                      \\(\\phi \\)\n                      \n                    , and is essentially important for deriving the unconditional energy stability of the proposed BDF2 scheme with variable time steps.

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this work the development of a machine learning-based Reduced Order Model (ROM) for the investigation of hemodynamics in a patient-specific configuration of Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) is proposed. The computational domain is referred to left branches of coronary arteries when a stenosis of the Left Main Coronary Artery (LMCA) occurs. The method extracts a reduced basis space from a collection of high-fidelity solutions via a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) algorithm and employs Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for the computation of the modal coefficients. The Full Order Model (FOM) is represented by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations discretized using a Finite Volume (FV) technique. Both physical and geometrical parametrization are taken into account, the former one related to the inlet flow rate and the latter one related to the stenosis severity. With respect to the previous works focused on the development of a ROM framework for the evaluation of coronary artery disease, the novelties of our study include the use of the FV method in a patient-specific configuration, the use of a data-driven ROM technique and the mesh deformation strategy based on a Free Form Deformation (FFD) technique. The performance of our ROM approach is analyzed in terms of the error between full order and reduced order solutions as well as the speed-up achieved at the online stage.",

The reference model reduction procedure is the directional HiPOD method, which combines Hierarchical Model reduction with a standard Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, according to an offline/online paradigm. In this paper we show that directional HiPOD looses in terms of accuracy when problem data are affected by noise. This is due to the interpolation driving the online phase, since it replicates, by definition, the noise trend. To overcome this limit, we replace interpolation with Machine Learning fitting models which better discriminate relevant physical features in the data from irrelevant unstructured noise.

The main aim of this paper is to propose and study a new matrix maximization model for computing ratios of \n                      \n                      \\(\\sigma _{i,k} / \\sigma _{j,k}\\)\n                      \n                     from \n                      \n                      \\({\\textbf{A}}_{1},\\ldots ,{\\textbf{A}}_{N}\\)\n                      \n                    . The resulting optimization problem can be solved by using Newton method on Lie Groups, and the convergence of the Newton method with well defined initial value can also be established. Numerical examples for synthetic data and mRNA expression data sets are reported to demonstrate the fast performance of the proposed method for solving the optimization model with other existing state-of-the-art algorithms and Riemannian Newton method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe design a multilevel correction type of adaptive finite element method based on the moving mesh technique for solving nonlinear eigenvalue problems. In this paper, we take the ground state of Bose–Einstein condensates as the example of a nonlinear eigenvalue problem to show the solving process. For this aim, we propose a non-nested augmented subspace method for the nonlinear eigenvalue problems since the sequence of finite element spaces generated by the r-adaptive method has non-nested property. The new method proposed in this paper can improve the efficiency for solving nonlinear eigenvalue problems by the corresponding theoretical analysis and numerical examples.",
