However, the Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM)-based algorithm used in [33] lacks the convergence guarantee. In this work, we propose an iterative support shrinking algorithm with proximal linearization for multi-phase image labeling problems, which is theoretically proven to be globally convergent. A key step is that we prove a lower bound theory for the nonzero entries of the gradient of the iterative sequence when both box constraint and simplex constraint are involved in the target energy minimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical attempt at the non-Lipschitz piecewise constant Mumford–Shah model. Numerical experiments are conducted on both two-phase and multi-phase labeling problems to indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

          "description": "Abstract\nSquare-root Lasso problems have already be shown to be robust regression problems. Furthermore, square-root regression problems with structured sparsity also plays an important role in statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we focus on the numerical computation of large-scale linearly constrained sparse group square-root Lasso problems. In order to overcome the difficulty that there are two nonsmooth terms in the objective function, we propose a dual semismooth Newton (SSN) based augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) for it. That is, we apply the ALM to the dual problem with the subproblem solved by the SSN method. To apply the SSN method, the positive definiteness of the generalized Jacobian is very important. Hence we characterize the equivalence of its positive definiteness and the constraint nondegeneracy condition of the corresponding primal problem. In numerical implementation, we fully employ the second order sparsity so that the Newton direction can be efficiently obtained. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

This paper proposes a new Nesterov’s Accelerated Riemannian Gradient algorithm using efficient orthographic retraction and tangent space projection. The subspace relationship between iterative and extrapolated sequences on the low-rank matrix manifold provides computational convenience. With perturbation analysis of truncated singular value decomposition and two retractions, we systematically analyze the local convergence of gradient algorithms and Nesterov’s variants in the Euclidean and Riemannian settings. Theoretically, we estimate the exact rate of local linear convergence under different parameters using the spectral radius in a closed form and give the optimal convergence rate and the corresponding momentum parameter. When the parameter is unknown, the adaptive restart scheme can avoid the oscillation problem caused by high momentum, thus approaching the optimal convergence rate. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the estimations of convergence rate and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive with first-order methods for matrix completion and matrix sensing.",

          "description": "Abstract\nA stabilized element-free Galerkin (EFG) method is developed and analyzed in this paper for the meshless numerical solution of Stokes problems. To accelerate the solution procedure and recover the optimal convergence impaired by Gauss integration, integration constraints of Galerkin numerical methods for Stokes problems are derived, and then the inherently consistent reproducing kernel gradient smoothing integration is incorporated into the EFG method with explicit quadrature rules in the reference space. By using Nitsche’s method to satisfy the Dirichlet boundary condition, the inf-sup stability, the existence and uniqueness, and the error estimation of the EFG solution with numerical integration are derived rigorously. Theoretical results reveal that the EFG error essentially comes from not only the meshless approximations of velocity and pressure, but also numerical integration of the Galerkin weak forms. It turns out a procedure on how to choose quadrature rules to ensure that the optimal convergence is not affected by the integration error. Numerical results demonstrate the consistency, efficiency and optimal convergence of the method, and support the theoretical results.",

In the new framework, the antiderivative of the nonlinear diffusion matrix is not needed. This allows a simple definition of the numerical flux, which can be used for general diffusion equations with no further modification. We also present the nonlinear stability analyses of the new direct discontinuous Galerkin methods and perform several numerical experiments to evaluate their performance. The numerical tests show that the symmetric and the interface correction versions of the method achieve optimal convergence and are superior to the nonsymmetric version, which demonstrates optimal convergence only for problems with diagonal diffusion matrices but loses order for even degree polynomials with a non-diagonal diffusion matrix. Singular or blow up solutions are also well captured with the new direct discontinuous Galerkin methods.",

By introducing an auxiliary function, we rewrite the original problem as an equivalent fourth-order coupled form in spherical coordinates. Using the properties of spherical harmonic and Laplace–Beltrami operator, we further decompose the original problem into a series of decoupled one-dimensional fourth-order linear eigenvalue problems, for which a new mixed variational formulation and its discretization is developed. For error estimates of numerical eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, we recall the spectral theory of compact operators. Towards this end, we derive the essential polar conditions, define a class of weighted Sobolev spaces, and most importantly, prove a sequence of two compact embedding properties for the weighted Sobolev spaces, based on which the spectral theory of compact operators for the variational formulation and discrete system can be established. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to confirm the theoretical error analysis and the efficiency of our algorithm.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, the stability analysis and optimal error estimates are presented for a kind of fully discrete schemes for solving one-dimensional linear convection–diffusion equation with periodic boundary conditions. The fully discrete schemes are defined with local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) spatial discretization methods coupled with implicit–explicit (IMEX) temporal discretization methods based on backward difference formulas (BDF). By combining an improved multiplier technique used in the stability analysis for multistep methods and the technique to deal with derivative and jump in LDG methods, we establish a general framework of stability analysis for the corresponding fully discrete LDG–IMEX–BDF schemes up to fifth order in time. The considered schemes are proved to be unconditionally stable, in the sense that a properly defined “discrete energy” is dissipative if the time step is upper bounded by a constant which is independent of the mesh size.

Some essential key properties of the weights of SFTR are explored for the first time. Based on these properties, we rigorously demonstrate the discrete energy decay property and maximum-principle preservation for the scheme. Numerical investigations show that the scheme can resolve the intrinsic initial singularity of such nonlinear fractional equations as tFAC equation on uniform meshes without any correction.

          "description": "Abstract\nWe study a class of constrained sparse optimization problems with cardinality penalty, where the feasible set is defined by box constraint, and the loss function is convex but not necessarily smooth. First, we propose an accelerated smoothing hard thresholding (ASHT) algorithm for solving such problems, which combines smoothing approximation, extrapolation technique and iterative hard thresholding method. The extrapolation coefficients can be chosen to satisfy \n                      \n                      \\(\\sup _k \\beta _k=1\\)\n                      \n                    . We discuss the convergence of ASHT algorithm with different extrapolation coefficients, and give a sufficient condition to ensure that any accumulation point of the iterates is a local minimizer of the original problem. For a class of special updating schemes on the extrapolation coefficients, we obtain that the iterates are convergent to a local minimizer of the problem, and the convergence rate is \n                      \n                      \\(o(\\ln ^{\\sigma } k/k)\\)\n                      \n                     with \n                      \n                      \\(\\sigma \\in (1/2, 1]\\)\n                      \n                     on the loss and objective function values. Second, we consider the case in which the loss function is Lipschitz continuously differentiable, and develop an accelerated hard thresholding (AHT) algorithm to solve it. We prove that the iterates of AHT algorithm converge to a local minimizer of the problem that satisfies a desirable lower bound property.

In this work we apply ML to accelerate a numerical discretization scheme: the radial basis function time domain (RBF-TD) method. The RBF-TD method uses scattered nodes in both space and time to time-step PDEs. Here we investigate replacing a costly L1 minimization step in the original RBF-TD method with an ensemble ML model known as an extremely randomized trees regressor (ERT). We show that an ERT model trained on a simple PDE can maintain the high order accuracy of the original method with often significant speed up, while generalizing to a variety of convection-dominated PDEs. Through this work, we also extend the RBF-TD method to problems in 2-D space plus time. This study illustrates a novel opportunity to use ML to augment finite difference-related approximations while maintaining high order convergence under node refinement.",

We address the problem of approximating the moments of the solution, [math], of an Itô stochastic differential equation (SDE) with drift and diffusion terms over a time grid [math]. In particular, we assume an explicit numerical scheme for the generation of sample paths [math] and then obtain recursive equations that yield any desired noncentral moment of [math] as a function of the initial condition [math]. The core of the methodology is the decomposition of the numerical solution [math] into a “central part” and an “effective noise” term. The central term is computed deterministically from the ordinary differential equation (ODE) that results from eliminating the diffusion term in the SDE, while the effective noise accounts for the stochastic deviation from the numerical solution of the ODE. For simplicity, we describe the proposed methodology based on an Euler–Maruyama integrator, but other explicit numerical schemes can be exploited in the same way. We also apply the moment approximations to construct estimates of the 1-dimensional marginal probability density functions of [math] based on a Gram–Charlier expansion. Both for the approximation of moments and 1-dimensional densities, we describe how to handle the cases in which the initial condition is fixed (i.e., [math] for some deterministic and known [math]) or random. In the latter case, we resort to polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) schemes in order to approximate the target moments. The methodology has been inspired by the PCE and differential algebra methods used for uncertainty propagation in astrodynamics problems. Hence, we illustrate its application for the quantification of uncertainty in a 2-dimensional Keplerian orbit perturbed by a Wiener noise process.",

By approximating the system as a compositional map between the gain and loss dynamics, the underlying nonlinear dynamics can be shown to be driven by energy balances in the systems. The gain-loss iterative mapping is similar to a normal form encoding for the pattern forming instabilities generated in such spatially extended systems. Similar to mode-locked lasers and rotating detonation engines, the underlying bifurcations persist for general forms of the loss and gain, both of which admit explicit representations in our approximation.

This work makes explicit the degrees of freedom involved in modeling the dynamics of a network, or some other first-order property of a network, such as a measurement function. In previous work, an admissible function in a network was constructed through the evaluation of what we called oracle components. These oracle components are defined through some minimal properties that they are expected to obey. This is a high-level description in the sense that it is not clear how one could design such an object. The goal is to obtain a low-level representation of these objects by unwrapping them into their degrees of freedom. To achieve this, we introduce two decompositions. The first one is the more intuitive one and allows us to define the important concept of coupling order. The second decomposition is built on top of the first one and is valid for the class of coupling components that have finite coupling order. Despite this requirement, we show that this is still a very useful tool for designing coupling components with infinite coupling orders, through a limit approach.",

The synchronization stability of a complex network system of coupled phase oscillators is discussed. In case the network is affected by disturbances, a stochastic linearized system of the coupled phase oscillators may be used to determine the fluctuations of phase differences in the lines between the nodes and to identify the vulnerable lines that may lead to desynchronization. The main result is the derivation of the asymptotic variance matrices of the phase differences which characterizes the severity of the fluctuations. It is found that the cycle space of the graph of the system plays a role in this characterization. With theory of the cycle space, the effect of forming small cycles on the fluctuations is evaluated. It is proven that adding a new line or increasing the coupling strength of a line affects the fluctuations in the lines in any cycle including this line, while it does not affect the fluctuations in the other lines. In particular, if the phase differences at the synchronous state are not changed by these actions, then the affected fluctuations reduce.",

This study formally adapts the time-domain linear sampling method (TLSM) for ultrasonic imaging of stationary and evolving fractures in safety-critical components. The TLSM indicator is then applied to the laboratory test data of [F. Pourahmadian and H. Yue, Inverse Problems, 37 (2021), 055012; F. Pourahmadian, Mech. Syst. Signal Process., 161 (2021), 108029] and the obtained reconstructions are compared to their frequency-domain counterparts. The results highlight the unique capability of the time-domain imaging functional for high-fidelity tracking of evolving damage, and its relative robustness to sparse and reduced-aperture data at moderate noise levels. A comparative analysis of the TLSM images against the multifrequency LSM maps of [F. Pourahmadian and H. Yue, Inverse Problems, 37 (2021), 055012] further reveals that thanks to the full-waveform inversion in time and space, the TLSM generates images of remarkably higher quality with the same dataset.",

In this paper, we study a stochastic optimization control problem for carbon emission reduction with two control variables, one of which is the stochastic emission reduction control strategy, and the other is the auction amount of carbon allowances. We optimize the total emission reduction cost by a two- step process. Fixing the auction amount, we optimize the emission reduction control strategy, and then relate the value function to a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. The existence and uniqueness of the classical solution of the equation are proved so as to describe the optimal control strategy. After that, we find the optimal auction amount by determining the zero point of the derivative. We then show that the auction amount minimizing the total cost is unique in a special case. Finally, the relationships between the optimal auction amount and the total cost and various parameters are discussed through numerical results.",

We study the dynamics of unsaturated flows within a fluid-infused wet patch in a thin porous layer, coupled with the transport of passive particles, partly inspired by some art practice and environmental and industrial activities. The role of wetting and capillary forces and the influence of evaporation are both emphasized. Two coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) are first derived to describe the time evolution of the fluid saturation and concentration of passive particles. Three dimensionless parameters are identified after appropriate nondimensionalization of the coupled PDEs, the influence of which is demonstrated through asymptotic and numerical solutions at both the early and late times. With evaporation, in particular, the fluid front first arrives at a maximum location after an initial period of spreading. Thereafter, the front starts to recede until the fluid drains out at a finite time. Correspondingly, the concentration of particles blows up at a finite time, when the size of the wet region shrinks to zero. Meanwhile, the spatial distribution of particles evolves towards a universal curve near the front at late times, as the particles gradually accumulate at the front of the wet patch. It is recognized that, while the spreading of fluid within a porous layer behaves similar to that of a viscous gravity current subject to volume loss, the frontal structure for the concentration of particles, to some extent, is similar to that of an intruding inviscid gravity current.",

In this paper we present a framework in which one can rigorously study the effect of spatio-temporal noise on traveling waves, stationary patterns, and oscillations that are invariant under the action of a finite-dimensional set of continuous isometries (such as translation or rotation). This formalism can accommodate patterns, waves, and oscillations in reaction-diffusion systems and neural field equations. To do this, we define the phase by precisely projecting the infinite-dimensional system onto the manifold of isometries. We outline a precise stochastic differential equation for the phase. The phase is then used to show that the probability of the system leaving the attracting basin of the manifold after an exponentially long period of time (in [math], the magnitude of the noise) is exponentially unlikely.",

We provide finite sample guarantees for the classical Chow–Liu algorithm [Chow and Liu, IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 14 (1968), pp. 462–467] to learn a tree-structured graphical model of a distribution. For a distribution [math] on [math] and a tree [math] on [math] nodes, we say [math] is an [math]-approximate tree for [math] if there is a [math]-structured distribution [math] such that [math] is at most [math] more than the best possible tree-structured distribution for [math]. We show that if [math] itself is tree-structured, then the Chow–Liu algorithm with the plug-in estimator for mutual information with [math] independent and identically distributed samples outputs an [math]-approximate tree for [math] with constant probability. In contrast, for a general [math] (which may not be tree-structured), [math] samples are necessary to find an [math]-approximate tree. Our upper bound is based on a new conditional independence tester that addresses an open problem posed by Canonne et al. [Proceedings of the 50th Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM, 2018, pp. 735–748]: we prove that for three random variables [math] each over [math], testing if [math] is 0 or [math] is possible with [math] samples. Finally, we show that for a specific tree [math], with [math] samples from a distribution [math] over [math], one can efficiently learn the closest [math]-structured distribution in KL divergence by applying the add-1 estimator at each node.",
