          "description": "Abstract\nIn the current research, we analyze dissipation and dispersion characteristics of the most accurate two and three-stage Gauss–Legendre implicit Runge–Kutta (R-K) methods. These methods, known for their A-stability and high stage order, are observed to carry minimum dissipation error along with the highest possible dispersive order in their respective classes. Investigation reveals that these schemes are inherently optimized to carry low phase error only at small wavenumber. It is noticed that a unique scheme, although usually sought, might not be best across diverse temporal step sizes. As larger temporal step size is imperative in conjunction with implicit R-K methods for physical problems, we thoroughly investigate to derive a class of minimum dissipation and optimally low dispersion implicit R-K schemes. Schemes are obtained by cutting down amplification error and maximum reduction of weighted phase error, suggest better accuracy for relatively bigger and varied CFL numbers. A potentially generalizable algorithm is used to design stable implicit R-K methods. As the work focuses on two and three-stage schemes, a comprehensive comparison using numerical test cases document only modest gain in accuracy or efficiency over Gauss methods.",

          "description": "Abstract\nFor differential equations with multiple order spatial derivatives, there are some shortcomings by the classical high order compact (HOC) discretization. At least one of them is reducing the computational efficiency due to the multiple inverse manipulation of matrices. This motivates us to design a new kind of compact method what is called combined high order compact methods. The basic idea lying in this kind of method is to solve all the spatial derivatives simultaneously. Then, it is used to solve coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (CNLS) equations which contain both the first and second order derivatives. This scheme is not only more compact and accurate than standard HOC scheme and standard finite difference method with the same order, but also it can construct structure-preserving schemes. It preserves the symplectic structure and mass, and sometimes energy and momentum. Numerical experiments indicate that the new scheme can simulate the CNLS equations very accurately and efficiently. The mass and momentum are exactly preserved. The energy is preserved in some especially cases.",

          "description": "Abstract\nA structure-preserving numerical method is presented and analyzed to simulate the motion of closed curves governed by area-conserved generalized curvature flow. We first propose a variational formulation and rigorously prove that it preserves two geometric structures of enclosed area conservation and perimeter decrease. Then the parametric finite element method is adopted to develop a semi-discrete scheme. Both the area conservation and perimeter decrease structure properties are strictly proven for the semi-discrete scheme by utilizing the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality and power mean inequality. On this basis, a fully discrete scheme is established by further taking the backward Euler method in the temporal direction and discretizing the unit normal vector appropriately. We give a rigorous proof that the scheme is structure-preserving at the discretized level. Finally, numerical results verify the structure-preserving property and reveal that the proposed method has second-order accuracy and enjoys asymptotic equal mesh distribution during the evolution.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we focus on a finite element projection method for inductionless magnetohydrodynamics equations. A fully discrete projection method based on Euler semi-implicit scheme is proposed in which continuous elements are used to approximate the Navier–Stokes equations and the divergence-conforming element is used to approximate the current density. The key of the projection method is that it must be compatible with two different spaces for calculating velocity, which leads to solve the pressure by solving a Poisson equation. The results show that the proposed projection scheme meets a discrete energy stability and the discrete current density keeps charge conservation property. In addition, this paper provides a rigorous optimal error analysis of velocity, pressure and current density.

          "description": "Abstract\nRecovering temporal image sequences (videos) based on indirect, noisy, or incomplete data is an essential yet challenging task. We specifically consider the case where each data set is missing vital information, which prevents the accurate recovery of the individual images. Although some recent (variational) methods have demonstrated high-resolution image recovery based on jointly recovering sequential images, there remain robustness issues due to parameter tuning and restrictions on the type of sequential images. Here, we present a method based on hierarchical Bayesian learning for the joint recovery of sequential images that incorporates prior intra- and inter-image information. Our method restores the missing information in each image by “borrowing” it from the other images. More precisely, we couple sequential images by penalizing their pixel-wise difference. The corresponding penalty terms (one for each pixel and pair of subsequent images) are treated as weakly-informative random variables that favor small pixel-wise differences but allow occasional outliers. As a result, all of the individual reconstructions yield improved accuracy. Our method can be used for various data acquisitions and allows for uncertainty quantification. Some preliminary results indicate its potential use for sequential deblurring and magnetic resonance imaging.",

          "description": "Abstract\nParallel-in-time methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) have been the subject of intense development over recent decades, particularly for diffusion-dominated problems. It has been widely reported in the literature, however, that many of these methods perform quite poorly for advection-dominated problems. Here we analyze the particular iterative parallel-in-time algorithm of multigrid reduction-in-time (MGRIT) for discretizations of constant-wave-speed linear advection problems. We focus on common method-of-lines discretizations that employ upwind finite differences in space and Runge-Kutta methods in time. Using a convergence framework we developed in previous work, we prove for a subclass of these discretizations that, if using the standard approach of rediscretizing the fine-grid problem on the coarse grid, robust MGRIT convergence with respect to CFL number and coarsening factor is not possible. This poor convergence and non-robustness is caused, at least in part, by an inadequate coarse-grid correction for smooth Fourier modes in space-time known as characteristic components. We propose an alternative coarse-grid operator that provides a better correction of these modes. This coarse-grid operator is related to previous work and uses a semi-Lagrangian discretization combined with an implicitly treated truncation error correction. Theory and numerical experiments show the proposed coarse-grid operator yields fast MGRIT convergence for many of the method-of-lines discretizations considered, including for both implicit and explicit discretizations of high order. Parallel results demonstrate speed-up over sequential time-stepping.",

The QB2X method uses both local complex Taylor expansions and plane wave type expansions to achieve a resulting representation which is numerically accurate for all target points inside a leaf box in the fast multipole method (FMM) hierarchical tree structure. The QB2X method explicitly includes nonlinear dependency of the boundary geometry in the plane wave expansions, thereby providing for higher-order representations of both the boundary geometry and density functions in the integrand, with its convergence following standard FMM error analysis.

These methods allow the use of standard finite elements for the solution of the problem while simultaneously removing a spurious pressure influence in the approximation error of the velocity of the fluid, or the displacement of an incompressible solid. To this end, reconstruction operators are utilized mapping discretely divergence free functions to divergence free functions. This work shows that the modifications proposed for Stokes equation by Linke (Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 268:782–800, 2014) also yield gradient robust methods for nearly incompressible elastic materials without the need to resort to discontinuous finite elements methods as proposed in Fu et al.

The spatial discretization is based on high order finite differences with summation-by-parts properties. Previously presented solution methods for this problem, based on the simultaneous approximation term (SAT) method, have shown to introduce significant stiffness. This can lead to highly inefficient schemes. Here, two new methods of imposing the interface conditions to avoid the stiffness problems are presented: (1) a projection method and (2) a hybrid between the projection method and the SAT method. Numerical experiments are performed using traditional and order-preserving interpolation operators. Both of the novel methods retain the accuracy and convergence behavior of the previously developed SAT method but are significantly less stiff.",

Two common governing equations are considered: reactive Euler equations and Navier–Stokes equations. Based on our recently developed high-order bound-preserving discontinuous Galerkin method in Du and Yang (J Comput Phys 469:111548, 2022), we add an extra damping term into this scheme to control the spurious oscillations. With the careful construction of the damping term, the proposed method not only achieves non-oscillatory property without sacrificing any order of accuracy but also preserves the conservative property which is the key ingredient of the bound-preserving technique developed in Du and Yang (2022). Therefore, the proposed OFDG method is well-compatible with the bound-preserving limiter in Du and Yang (2022). Similar to Liu et al. (SIAM J Sci Comput 44:A230–A259, 2022), the conservative modified exponential Runge–Kutta method is used to relax the restriction of time step sizes and preserve the conservative property of the fully discrete schemes.

Fully resolving dynamics of materials with rapidly varying features involves expensive fine-scale computations which need to be conducted on macroscopic scales. The theory of homogenization provides an approach for deriving effective macroscopic equations which eliminates the small scales by exploiting scale separation. An accurate homogenized model avoids the computationally expensive task of numerically solving the underlying balance laws at a fine scale, thereby rendering a numerical solution of the balance laws more computationally tractable. In complex settings, homogenization only defines the constitutive model implicitly, and machine learning can be used to learn the constitutive model explicitly from localized fine-scale simulations. In the case of one-dimensional viscoelasticity, the linearity of the model allows for a complete analysis. We establish that the homogenized constitutive model may be approximated by a recurrent neural network that captures the memory. The memory is encapsulated in the evolution of an appropriate finite set of hidden variables, which are discovered through the learning process and dependent on the history of the strain. Simulations are presented which validate the theory. Guidance for the learning of more complex models, such as arise in plasticity, using similar techniques, is given.",

Optimal balance is a nonasymptotic numerical method for computing a point on an elliptic slow manifold for two-scale dynamical systems with strong gyroscopic forces. It works by solving a modified differential equation as a boundary value problem in time, where the nonlinear terms are adiabatically ramped up from zero to the fully nonlinear dynamics. A dedicated boundary value solver, however, is often not directly available. The most natural alternative is a nudging solver, where the problem is repeatedly solved forward and backward in time and the respective boundary conditions are restored whenever one of the temporal end points is visited. In this paper, we show quasi-convergence of this scheme in the sense that the termination residual of the nudging iteration is as small as the asymptotic error of the method itself, i.e., under appropriate assumptions exponentially small. This confirms that optimal balance in its nudging formulation is an effective algorithm. Further, it shows that the boundary value problem formulation of optimal balance is well posed up to at most a residual error as small as the asymptotic error of the method itself. The key step in our proof is a careful two-component Gronwall inequality.",

Precisely, we show that the dominant part of the heat around the nanoparticle is the electric field multiplied by a constant which is explicitly and solely dependent on the permittivity and quantities related to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the magnetization (or the Newtonian) operator, defined on the nanoparticle, and inversely proportional to the distance to the nanoparticle. The nanoparticles are described via the Lorentz model. If the used incident frequency is chosen related to the plasmonic frequency [math] (via the magnetization operator), then the nanoparticle behaves as a plasmonic one; if it is chosen related to the undamped resonance frequency [math] (via the Newtonian operator), then it behaves as a dielectric one. The two regimes exhibit different optical behaviors. In both cases, we estimate the generated heat and discuss advantages of each incident frequency regime.

          "description": "Multiscale Modeling & Simulation, Volume 21, Issue 2, Page 513-541, June 2023. \n Abstract. Numerical multiscale methods usually rely on some coupling between a macroscopic and a microscopic model. The macroscopic model is incomplete as effective quantities, such as the homogenized material coefficients or fluxes, are missing in the model. These effective data need to be computed by running local microscale simulations followed by a local averaging of the microscopic information. Motivated by the classical homogenization theory, it is a common practice to use local elliptic cell problems for computing the missing homogenized coefficients in the macro model. Such a consideration results in a first order error [math], where [math] represents the wavelength of the microscale variations and [math] is the size of the microscopic simulation boxes. This error, called “resonance error,” originates from the boundary conditions used in the microproblem and typically dominates all other errors in a multiscale numerical method. Optimal decay of the resonance error remains an open problem, although several interesting approaches reducing the effect of the boundary have been proposed over the last two decades. In this paper, as an attempt to resolve this problem, we propose a computationally efficient, fully elliptic approach with exponential decay of the resonance error.",

We develop a model for investigating the impact of rainstorm variability on the formation of banded vegetation patterns in dryland ecosystems. Water input, during rare rainstorms, is modeled as an instantaneous kick to the soil water. The redistribution, from surface water to soil moisture, accounts for the impact of vegetation on infiltration rate and downslope overland flow speed. These two positive feedbacks between water and biomass distributions act on the fast timescales of rain storms. During dry periods, a classic reaction-diffusion framework is used for the slow processes associated with soil water and biomass. This pulsed-precipitation model predicts that the preferred spacing of the vegetation bands is determined by the characteristic distance that a storm pulse of water travels overland before infiltrating into the soil. In this way, the vegetation pattern is determined by the fast ecohydrological processes and may be attuned with its dryland precipitation pattern. We demonstrate how this modeling framework, suited for stochastic rain inputs, can be used to investigate possible collapse of a dryland pattern-forming ecosystem under different precipitation patterns with identical low annual mean. Model simulations suggest, for instance, that shorter rainy seasons and greater variability in storm depth may both hasten ecosystem collapse.",

A reduced order modeling strategy is proposed that can accurately capture the behavior of strongly perturbed nonlinear dynamical systems, i.e., those that are subject to general, large magnitude inputs. In contrast to standard variational approaches which consider dynamics in the neighborhood of a single reference trajectory, the proposed methodology augments the dynamics with an additional variable that continuously selects from a family of reference trajectories in order to limit truncation errors that result from neglected nonlinear terms. Provided the reference trajectories contract sufficiently rapidly in some directions, a reduced order set of equations can be obtained by choosing an appropriate coordinate system. Direct numerical approaches for computation of the necessary terms of the associated reduced order equations are provided. Crucially, because the proposed reduction strategy does not require the existence of a persistent, stable fixed point or periodic orbit, it can be implemented in situations where external inputs cause the dynamics to transition through a bifurcation. Two examples with relevance to neural control are provided. In the first, the proposed reduction strategy allows for the formulation of a numerically tractable control problem to identify energy-optimal inputs that eliminate tonic firing in a neural model. In the second example, the proposed reduction framework accurately captures successive transitions between quiescence and tonic firing across the boundary of a saddle-node on invariant circle bifurcation.",

Because of the high dimensionality of reaction-diffusion systems on networks, exploration for the bifurcation properties of such systems has been far less thorough than their corresponding parabolic PDE systems. With the overcoming of this long-standing difficulty, we consider the steady state bifurcation for the general network-organized reaction-diffusion system and derive the algorithm of calculating the perturbation incorporated restricted system associated with the simple zero singularity, through seeking out the parameter dependent center manifolds belonging to the unique zero eigenvalue. Rigorous theoretical analysis for the third-order truncated restricted system shows that the complex underlying networks can trigger some bifurcation types differing from the usual supercritical and subcritical pitchfork bifurcations and so enrich the dynamical behaviors of reaction-diffusion process in networks. To illustrate the application for our obtained theoretical results, we conduct a strict steady state bifurcation analysis for a metapopulation epidemic system defined on four typical connected undirected underlying networks, and find that there exist some new multistability phenomena and hysteresis effects in the irregular small-word and scale-free lattice network.",

Optimal packing is applied in physics for investigation of macroscopic properties of composites and porous media. The present paper demonstrates that the optimal packing of perfectly conducting disks on the plane corresponds to the minimal effective conductivity for macroscopically isotropic composites. Such an optimal location is studied and compared to the pure geometric problem for [math] disks packing on the flat torus. The hexagonal (triangular) array of disks solves the problem for the triangle lattice numbers [math]. The rest of the cases [math] are investigated separately by minimization of structural sums constructed by means of the Eisenstein functions.",

In this article, we study the problem of stabilizing the traffic flow on a ring road to a uniform steady-state using autonomous vehicles (AV). Traffic is represented at a microscopic level via a Bando-Follow-the-Leader model capable of reproducing phantom jams. For the single-lane case, a single AV can stabilize an arbitrary large ring road with an arbitrary large number of cars. Moreover, this stabilization is exponentially quick with a decay rate independent of the number of cars and a control gain also independent of the number of cars. On the other side, the stabilization domain and stabilization time depend on the number of cars. Two types of controller algorithms are proposed: a proportional control and a proportional-integral control. In both cases, the measurements used by the controller only depend on the local data around the AV, enabling an easy implementation. After numerical tests of the single-lane case, a multilane model is described using a safety-incentive mechanism for lane change. Numerical simulations for the multilane ring road suggest that the control strategy is also very efficient in such a setting, even with a single AV.",

The breaking of a detailed balance in fluids through Coriolis forces or odd-viscous stresses has profound effects on the dynamics of surface waves. Here we explore both weakly and strongly nonlinear waves in a three-dimensional fluid with vertical odd viscosity with and without the Coriolis effect. Our model describes the free surface of a shallow fluid composed of nearly vertical vortex filaments, which all stand perpendicular to the surface. We find that the odd viscosity in this configuration induces previously unexplored nonlinear effects in shallow-water waves, arising from both stresses on the surface and stress gradients in the bulk. By assuming weak nonlinearity, we find reduced equations including Korteweg–de Vries, Ostrovsky, and Kadomtsev–Petviashvilli equations with modified coefficients. At sufficiently large odd viscosity, the dispersion changes sign, allowing for compact two-dimensional solitary waves. We show that odd viscosity and surface tension have the same effect on the free surface, but distinct signatures in the fluid flow. Our results describe the collective dynamics of many-vortex systems, which can also occur in oceanic and atmospheric geophysics.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Volume 83, Issue 3, Page 966-984, June 2023. \n Abstract. A generalization of the Schwarz integral formula in the class of multiply connected circular domains is constructed. A classical Schwarz integral formula retrieves, up to an imaginary constant, an analytic function in a domain given its real part on the boundary of a domain; Poisson integral formulas are well-known examples for simply connected domains. The generalized integral formulas derived here retrieve an analytic function given more general linear combinations of its real and imaginary parts on each boundary component of a multiply connected domain. Those linear combinations can be different on each boundary component. The chief mathematical tool is the prime function of a multiply connected circular domain. A Schwarz integral formula for such domains, retrieving an analytic function given its real part on all boundary components, was derived in terms of the prime function by Crowdy [Complex Var. Elliptic Equ., 53 (2008), pp. 221–236]. The present paper combines those formulas with use of radial-slit conformal mappings, also expressible in terms of the prime function, to produce integral expressions for analytic functions where more general linear combinations of their real and imaginary parts are specified on the boundary components of a multiply connected domain. We refer to the resulting expressions as generalized Schwarz integral formulas. Their usefulness and versatility are showcased by application to three topical problems: finding the potential around periodic interdigitated electrodes, solving the free boundary problem for hollow vortex wakes behind a bluff body, and determining the two-phase flow over a so-called liquid-infused surface.",
