However, in many applications this minimization problem cannot be solved exactly, and instead, a numerical method which computes an approximate minimum over a suitable subfamily of Borel functions has to be used. The quality of the result depends on the adequacy of the subfamily and the performance of the numerical method. In this paper, we derive an expected value representation of the minimal mean squared distance which in many applications can efficiently be approximated with a standard Monte Carlo average. This enables us to provide guarantees for the accuracy of any numerical approximation of a given conditional expectation. We illustrate the method by assessing the quality of approximate conditional expectations obtained by linear, polynomial and neural network regression in different concrete examples.",

Solutions for GNEPs are called generalized Nash equilibria (GNEs). In this paper, we propose a numerical method for finding GNEs of GNEPs of polynomials based on the polyhedral homotopy continuation and the Moment-SOS hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations. We show that our method can find all GNEs if they exist, or detect the nonexistence of GNEs, under some genericity assumptions.

          "description": "Abstract\nDynamical systems that involve non-linearity of the dynamics is a major challenge encountered in learning these systems. Similarly, the lack of adequate models for phenomena that reflect the governing physics can be an obstacle to an appropriate analysis. Nonetheless, some numerically or experimentally measured data can be found. Based on this data, and using a data-driven method such as the Loewner framework, it is possible to manage this data to derive a high fidelity reduced dynamical system that mimics the behaviour of the original data. In this paper, we tackle the issue of large amount of data presented by samples of transfer functions in a frequency-domain. The main step in this framework consists in computing singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Loewner matrix which provides accurate reduced systems. However, the large amount of data prevents this decomposition from being computed properly. We exploit the fact that the Loewner and shifted Loewner matrices, the key tools of Loewner framework, satisfy certain large scale Sylvester matrix equations. Using an extended block Krylov subspace method, a good approximation in a factored form of the Loewner and shifted Loewner matrices can be obtained and a minimal computation cost of the SVD is ensured. This method facilitates the process of a large amount of data and guarantees a good quality of the inferred model at the end of the process. Accuracy and efficiency of our method are assessed in the final section.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we first deduce an improved chemotaxis-fluid system by introducing a chemotactic stress force, which can be used to describe the chemotactic movement of bacteria in a viscous fluid. Compared with the classical chemotaxis-Navier–Stokes system, the newly modified system obeys the law of energy dissipation. To solve such a chemotaxis-fluid system, we develop a linear, decoupled fully-discrete finite element scheme by combining the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach, implicit-explicit (IMEX) scheme and pressure-projection method. The unconditional energy stability of the developed scheme is proved rigorously, and we further prove the optimal error estimates for the fully discrete scheme, especially for the pressure bound. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to verify the accuracy, energy stability and performance of the proposed numerical scheme.",

We use an algebraic equivalent transformation of the centering equation of the system which defines the central path. The algebraic transformation plays an essential role in the calculation of the new search directions. We prove that the iteration complexity of the algorithm coincides with the best known ones for interior-point methods (IPMs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first corrector-predictor interior-point algorithm that uses the search directions obtained from the desired algebraic transformation for semidefinite optimization.

We first motivate our work with realistic examples from nano-electronics, high field magnets and ophthalmology. We then define a general framework stemming from the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin method that accounts naturally for the IBC and we provide a complete analysis at continuous and discrete levels. The implementation in the Feel++framework is then detailed and the convergence and scalability properties are verified.

The element is similar to [C. Taylor and P. Hood, Comput. & Fluids, 1(1973), 73–100] in the Stokes flow. Using a uniform discrete B-B inequality for the mixed finite element pairs, we show the optimal rate of convergence that is robust in the incompressible limit. By a new regularity result that is uniform in both the materials parameter and the incompressibility, we prove the method converges with 1/2 order to the solution with strong boundary layer effects. Moreover, we estimate the convergence rate of the numerical solution to the unperturbed second-order elliptic system. Numerical results for both smooth solutions and the solutions with sharp layers confirm the theoretical prediction.",

The proposed schemes are constructed by using a flux-limiting technique that combines a positivity-violating entropy stable method of arbitrary order of accuracy and a novel first-order positivity-preserving entropy stable finite volume-type scheme discretized on the same Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto grid points used for constructing the high-order discrete operators. The positivity-preserving and excellent discontinuity-capturing properties are achieved by adding an artificial dissipation in the form of the low- and high-order Brenner–Navier–Stokes diffusion operators. Furthermore, the new schemes are entropy conservative for smooth inviscid flows and freestream preserving.

          "description": "Abstract\nNon-affine parametric dependencies, nonlinearities and advection-dominated regimes of the model of interest can result in a slow Kolmogorov n-width decay, which precludes the realization of efficient reduced-order models based on linear subspace approximations. Among the possible solutions, there are purely data-driven methods that leverage autoencoders and their variants to learn a latent representation of the dynamical system, and then evolve it in time with another architecture. Despite their success in many applications where standard linear techniques fail, more has to be done to increase the interpretability of the results, especially outside the training range and not in regimes characterized by an abundance of data. Not to mention that none of the knowledge on the physics of the model is exploited during the predictive phase. In order to overcome these weaknesses, we implement the non-linear manifold method introduced by Lee and Carlberg (J Comput Phys 404:108973, 2020) with hyper-reduction achieved through reduced over-collocation and teacher–student training of a reduced decoder. We test the methodology on a 2d non-linear conservation law and a 2d shallow water models, and compare the results obtained with a purely data-driven method for which the dynamics is evolved in time with a long-short term memory network.",

In the latter, the level-set method is employed for topography simulations of semiconductor device fabrication processes, being driven by complicated physical and chemical models. These models tend to produce surfaces with critical points where accuracy is paramount. To efficiently increase the accuracy in regions neighboring these critical points, automatic hierarchical domain refinement is required, guided by robust feature detection. Feature detection has to be computationally efficient and sufficiently accurate to reliably detect the critical points. To that end, we present a fast parallel geometric feature detection algorithm for three-dimensional level-set functions. Our approach is based on two different, complementary curvature calculation methods of the zero level-set and an optimized feature detection parameter to detect features. For performance reasons, our algorithm can be in principal linked to different curvature calculation methods, however, as will be discussed, two particularly attractive options are available: (i) A novel extension of the standard curvature calculation method for level-set functions, and (ii) an often disregarded method for calculating the curvature due to its purported low numerical accuracy. We show, however, that the latter is still a viable option, and that our algorithm is able to reliably detect features on geometries stemming from complicated, practically relevant geometries. Our algorithm and findings are applicable to other fields of applications such as surface simplification.",

We study an optimal transportation approach for recovering parameters in dynamical systems with a single smoothly varying attractor. We assume that the data are not sufficient for estimating time derivatives of state variables but enough to approximate the long-time behavior of the system through an approximation of its physical measure. Thus, we fit physical measures by taking the Wasserstein distance from optimal transportation as a misfit function between two probability distributions. In particular, we analyze the regularity of the resulting loss function for general transportation costs and derive gradient formulas. Physical measures are approximated as fixed points of suitable PDE-based Perron–Frobenius operators. Test cases discussed in the paper include common low-dimensional dynamical systems.",

We study stochastic perturbations of ODEs with stable limit cycles — referred to as stochastic oscillators — and investigate the response of the asymptotic (in time) frequency of oscillations to changing noise amplitude. Unlike previous studies, we do not restrict our attention to the small-noise limit, and we account for the fact that large deviation events may push the system out of its oscillatory regime. To do so, we consider stochastic oscillators conditioned on their remaining in an oscillatory regime for all time. This leads us to use the theory of quasi-ergodic measures, and to define quasi-asymptotic frequencies as conditional, long-time average frequencies. We show that quasi-asymptotic frequencies exist under minimal assumptions, though they may or may not be observable in practice. Our discussion recovers and expands upon previous results on stochastic oscillators in the literature. In particular, existing results imply that the asymptotic frequency of a stochastic oscillator depends quadratically on the noise amplitude. We describe scenarios where this prediction holds, though we also show that it is not true in general — potentially, even for small noise.",

Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is an efficient tool for decomposing spatio-temporal data into a set of low-dimensional modes, yielding the oscillation frequencies and the growth rates of physically significant modes. In this paper, we propose a novel DMD model that can be used for dynamical systems affected by multiplicative noise. We first derive a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator for the data-based model decomposition of a linear dynamical system corrupted by certain multiplicative noise. Applying penalty relaxation to the MAP estimator, we obtain the proposed DMD model whose epigraphical limits are the MAP estimator and the conventional optimized DMD model. We also propose an efficient alternating gradient descent method for solving the proposed DMD model and analyze its convergence behavior. The proposed model is demonstrated on both the synthetic data and the numerically generated one-dimensional combustor data and is shown to have superior reconstruction properties compared to state-of-the-art DMD models. Considering that multiplicative noise is ubiquitous in numerous dynamical systems, the proposed DMD model opens up new possibilities for accurate data-based modal decomposition.",

We study the qualitative behavior of a model to represent local regulation in a metabolic network. The model is based on the end-product control structure introduced in [A. Goelzer et al., BMC Syst.

We suppose the input to the pathway to switch between zero and a positive value according to the concentration of the metabolite effector. Considering the switching system as a differential inclusion, we prove that it converges to a globally uniformly asymptotically stable equilibrium point, reaches the sliding mode, or oscillates around the sliding mode depending on the positive value of the input. Finally, we show that in any case the solution of the switching system is the limit of solutions of equation sequences with smooth or piecewise linear inputs.",

The angular value of dimension [math] measures the maximal average rotation which an [math]-dimensional subspace of the phase space experiences through the dynamics of a discrete-time linear system. Our main results relate the notion of angular value to the well-known dichotomy (or Sacker–Sell) spectrum and its associated spectral bundles. In particular, we prove a reduction theorem which shows that instead of maximizing over all subspaces, it suffices to maximize over so-called trace spaces which have their basis in the spectral fibers. The reduction leads to an algorithm for computing angular values of dimensions one and two. We apply the algorithm to several systems of dimension up to [math] and demonstrate its efficiency to detect the fastest rotating subspace even if it is not dominant under the forward dynamics.",

The diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal arising from biological tissues can be numerically simulated by solving the Bloch–Torrey partial differential equation. Numerical simulations can facilitate the investigation of the relationship between the diffusion MRI signals and cellular structures. With the rapid advance of available computing power, the diffusion MRI community has begun to employ numerical simulations for model formulation and validation, as well as for imaging sequence optimization. Existing simulation frameworks use the finite difference method, the finite element method, or the Matrix Formalism method to solve the Bloch–Torrey partial differential equation. We propose a new method based on the efficient evaluation of layer potentials. In this paper, the mathematical framework and the numerical implementation of the new method are described. We demonstrate the convergence of our method via numerical experiments and analyze the errors linked to various model and simulation parameters.

First, we derive a hierarchy of models describing the evolution of the microbial populations, each with decreasing complexity. This sequential order reduction reveals the connections between several popular classes of models used in this context. Second, we demonstrate the analytical insight the order reduction provides by studying the optimal control of such a reduced-order system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Appealing to Pontryagin’s maximum principle, we find different optimal control structures within different regions of the parameter space. Explicit solutions are obtained in a subset of parameter space, while, for the remainder of parameter space, closed-form solutions are obtained that depend on a scalar value that solves a particular transcendental equation.

In this paper, we introduce two new techniques to analyze the complexity of promise CSPs: one is based on topology and the other on adjunction. We apply these techniques, together with the previously introduced algebraic approach, to obtain new unconditional NP-hardness results for a significant class of approximate graph coloring and promise graph homomorphism problems.",

We consider the problem of computing a (pure) Bayes–Nash equilibrium in the first-price auction with continuous value distributions and discrete bidding space. We prove that when bidders have independent subjective prior beliefs about the value distributions of the other bidders, computing an [math]-equilibrium of the auction is PPAD-complete, and computing an exact equilibrium is FIXP-complete. We also provide an efficient algorithm for solving a special case of the problem for a fixed number of bidders and available bids.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. Let [math] be a family of sets in some metric space. In the [math]-chasing problem, an online algorithm observes a request sequence of sets in [math] and responds (online) by giving a sequence of points in these sets. The movement cost is the distance between consecutive such points. The competitive ratio is the worst case ratio (over request sequences) between the total movement of the online algorithm and the smallest movement one could have achieved by knowing in advance the request sequence. The family [math] is said to be chaseable if there exists an online algorithm with finite competitive ratio. In 1991, Linial and Friedman conjectured that the family of convex sets in Euclidean space is chaseable. We prove this conjecture.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. We prove the existence of an oblivious routing scheme that is [math]-competitive in terms of [math], thus resolving a well-known question in oblivious routing. Concretely, consider an undirected network and a set of packets each with its own source and destination. The objective is to choose a path for each packet, from its source to its destination, so as to minimize [math], defined as follows: The dilation is the maximum path hop length, and the congestion is the maximum number of paths that include any single edge. The routing scheme obliviously and randomly selects a path for each packet independent of (the existence of) the other packets. Despite this obliviousness, the selected paths have [math] within a [math] factor of the best possible value. More precisely, for any integer hop constraint [math], this oblivious routing scheme selects paths of length at most [math] and is [math]-competitive in terms of congestion in comparison to the best possible congestion achievable via paths of length at most [math] hops. These paths can be sampled in polynomial time. This result can be viewed as an analogue of the celebrated oblivious routing results of Räcke [Proceedings of the 43rd Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2002; Proceedings of the 40th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2008], which are [math]-competitive in terms of congestion but are not competitive in terms of dilation.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. Submodular function minimization (SFM) and matroid intersection are fundamental discrete optimization problems with applications in many fields. It is well known that both of these can be solved making [math] queries to a relevant oracle (evaluation oracle for SFM and rank oracle for matroid intersection), where [math] denotes the universe size. However, all known polynomial query algorithms are highly adaptive, requiring at least [math] rounds of querying the oracle. A natural question is whether these can be efficiently solved in a highly parallel manner, namely, with [math] queries using only polylogarithmic rounds of adaptivity. An important step towards understanding the adaptivity needed for efficient parallel SFM was taken recently in the work of Balkanski and Singer who showed that any SFM algorithm making [math] queries necessarily requires [math] rounds. This left open the possibility of efficient SFM algorithms in polylogarithmic rounds. For matroid intersection, even the possibility of a constant round, [math] query algorithm was not hitherto ruled out. In this work, we prove that any, possibly randomized, algorithm for submodular function minimization or matroid intersection making [math] queries requires (Throughout the paper, we use the usual convention of using [math] to denote [math] and using [math] to denote [math] for some unspecified constant [math]) [math] rounds of adaptivity. In fact, we show a polynomial lower bound on the number of rounds of adaptivity even for algorithms that make at most [math] queries for any constant [math]. Therefore, even though SFM and matroid intersection are efficiently solvable, they are not highly parallelizable in the oracle model.",
