          "description": "Abstract\nA novel approach for the stabilization of the discontinuous Galerkin method based on the Dafermos entropy rate crition is presented. The approach is centered around the efficient solution of linear or nonlinear optimization problems in every timestep as a correction to the basic discontinuous Galerkin scheme. The thereby enforced Dafermos criterion results in improved stability compared to the basic method while retaining a high order of accuracy in numerical experiments for scalar conservation laws. Further modification of the optimization problem allows also to enforce classical entropy inequalities for the scheme. The proposed stabilization is therefore an alternative to flux-differencing to enforce entropy inequalities. As the shock-capturing abilities of the scheme are also enhanced is the method also an alternative to finite-volume subcells, artificial viscosity, modal filtering, and other shock capturing procedures in one space dimension. Tests are carried out for Burgers’ equation.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper presents a new strategy to deal with the excessive diffusion that standard finite volume methods for compressible Euler equations display in the limit of low Mach number. The strategy can be understood as using centered discretizations for the acoustic part of the Euler equations and stabilizing them with a leap-frog-type (“sequential explicit”) time integration, a fully explicit method. This time integration takes inspiration from time-explicit staggered grid numerical methods. In this way, advantages of staggered methods carry over to collocated methods. The paper provides a number of new collocated schemes for linear acoustic/Maxwell equations that are inspired by the Yee scheme. They are then extended to an all-speed method for the full Euler equations on Cartesian grids. By taking the opposite view and taking inspiration from collocated methods, the paper also suggests a new way of staggering the variables which increases the stability as compared to the traditional Yee scheme.",

          "description": "Abstract\nProper orthogonal decomposition (POD) allows reduced-order modeling of complex dynamical systems at a substantial level, while maintaining a high degree of accuracy in modeling the underlying dynamical systems. Advances in machine learning algorithms enable learning POD-based dynamics from data and making accurate and fast predictions of dynamical systems. This paper extends the recently proposed heavy-ball neural ODEs (HBNODEs) (Xia et al. NeurIPS, 2021] for learning data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) in the POD context, in particular, for learning dynamics of time-varying coefficients generated by the POD analysis on training snapshots constructed by solving full-order models. HBNODE enjoys several practical advantages for learning POD-based ROMs with theoretical guarantees, including 1) HBNODE can learn long-range dependencies effectively from sequential observations, which is crucial for learning intrinsic patterns from sequential data, and 2) HBNODE is computationally efficient in both training and testing. We compare HBNODE with other popular ROMs on several complex dynamical systems, including the von Kármán Street flow, the Kurganov-Petrova-Popov equation, and the one-dimensional Euler equations for fluids modeling.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe diffusive-viscous wave equation (DVWE) is widely used in seismic exploration since it can explain frequency-dependent seismic reflections in a reservoir with hydrocarbons. Most of the existing numerical approximations for the DVWE are based on domain truncation with ad hoc boundary conditions. However, this would generate artificial reflections as well as truncation errors. To this end, we directly consider the DVWE in unbounded domains. We first show the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of the solution of the DVWE. We then develop a Hermite spectral Galerkin scheme and derive the corresponding error estimate showing that the Hermite spectral Galerkin approximation delivers a spectral rate of convergence provided sufficiently smooth solutions. Several numerical experiments with constant and discontinuous coefficients are provided to verify the theoretical result and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, We verify the error estimate for both smooth and non-smooth source terms and initial conditions. In view of the error estimate and the regularity result, we show the sharpness of the convergence rate in terms of the regularity of the source term. We also show that the artificial reflection does not occur by using the present method.",

The well trained ResNet solvers obtain 2nd, 3rd and 5th orders of one step errors and behave just as its counterpart finite difference method for linear and nonlinear ODEs with regular solutions. In particular, we carry out (1) architecture study in terms of number of hidden layers and neurons per layer to obtain optimal network structure; (2) target study to verify the ResNet solver is as accurate as its finite difference method counterpart; (3) solution trajectory simulations. A sequence of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and capability of ResNet solver.",

We start from a drift-diffusion equation in which the drift term describes the effect of bubble traps and is modeled by a short-range potential with an attractive term and a repulsive core. The interaction of the particles attracted by the bubble surface is simulated by the Lennard–Jones potential that simplifies the capture due to the hydrophobic properties of the ions. In our model, the effect of the potential is replaced by a suitable boundary condition derived by mass conservation and asymptotic analysis. The potential is assumed to have a range of small size [math]. An asymptotic expansion in the [math] is considered, and the boundary conditions are obtained by retaining the lowest-order terms in the expansion. Another aspect we investigate is the saturation effect coming from high concentrations in the proximity of the bubble surface. The validity of the model is carefully checked with several tests in one and two dimensions and different geometries.",

This paper is concerned with the inverse elastic scattering problem for a random potential in three dimensions. Interpreted as a distribution, the potential is assumed to be a microlocally isotropic Gaussian random field whose covariance operator is a classical pseudodifferential operator. Given the potential, the direct scattering problem is shown to be well-posed in the sense of distributions by studying the equivalent Lippmann–Schwinger integral equation. For the inverse scattering problem, we demonstrate that the microlocal strength of the random potential can be uniquely determined with probability one by a single realization of the high frequency limit of the averaged compressional or shear backscattered far-field pattern of the scattered wave. The analysis employs the integral operator theory, the Born approximation in the high frequency regime, the microlocal analysis for the Fourier integral operators, and the ergodicity of the wave field.",

Dynamic contact angle hysteresis is of critical importance for many two-phase flow problems with moving contact lines. It is induced by inhomogeneity or roughness of the substrates. In this paper, we present theoretical studies on the time averaging of a reduced model for wetting on rough surfaces and also the analysis on the effect of stochastic thermal forces. We derive equations for the averaged dynamics and show that the apparent contact angle depends on the harmonic averaging of the geometric and chemical properties of the substrates as well as the contact line velocity. The contact angle hysteresis can be determined quantitatively by the equations. The averaging results are proved rigorously by multi-scale analysis and verified by some numerical examples.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 52, Issue 2, Page 412-451, April 2023. \n Abstract. In the [math]-Consensus-Halving problem, a fundamental problem in fair division, there are [math] agents with valuations over the interval [0,1], and the goal is to divide the interval into pieces and assign a label “[math]” or “[math]” to each piece, such that every agent values the total amount of “[math]” and the total amount of “[math]” almost equally. The problem was recently proven by Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg [Proceedings of the 50th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2018, pp. 51–64; Proceedings of the 51st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2019, pp. 638–649] to be the first “natural” complete problem for the computational class PPA, answering a decade-old open question. In this paper, we examine the extent to which the problem becomes easy to solve if one restricts the class of valuation functions. To this end, we provide the following contributions. First, we obtain a strengthening of the PPA-hardness result of Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg [Proceedings of the 51st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2019, pp. 638–649] to the case when agents have piecewise uniform valuations with only two blocks. We obtain this result via a new reduction, which is in fact conceptually much simpler than the corresponding one in Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg [Proceedings of the 51st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2019, pp. 638–649]. Then, we consider the case of single-block (uniform) valuations and provide a parameterized polynomial-time algorithm for solving [math]-Consensus-Halving for any [math], as well as a polynomial-time algorithm for [math]. Finally, an important application of our new techniques is the first hardness result for a generalization of Consensus-Halving, the Consensus-[math]-Division problem [F. W. Simmons and F. E. Su, Math. Social Sci., 45 (2003), pp. 15–25]. In particular, we prove that [math]-Consensus-[math]-Division is PPAD-hard.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. A tensor network is a diagram that specifies a way to “multiply” a collection of tensors together to produce another tensor (or matrix). Many existing algorithms for tensor problems (such as tensor decomposition and tensor PCA), although they are not presented this way, can be viewed as spectral methods on matrices built from simple tensor networks. In this work we leverage the full power of this abstraction to design new algorithms for certain continuous tensor decomposition problems. An important and challenging family of tensor problems comes from orbit recovery, a class of inference problems involving group actions (inspired by applications such as cryo-electron microscopy). Orbit recovery problems over finite groups can often be solved via standard tensor methods. However, for infinite groups, no general algorithms are known. We give a new spectral algorithm based on tensor networks for one such problem: continuous multi-reference alignment over the infinite group SO(2). Our algorithm extends to the more general heterogeneous case.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. We introduce a new technique for proving membership of problems in FIXP: the class capturing the complexity of computing a fixed point of an algebraic circuit. Our technique constructs a “pseudogate,” which can be used as a black box when building FIXP circuits. This pseudogate, which we term the “OPT-gate,” can solve most convex optimization problems. Using the OPT-gate, we prove new FIXP-membership results, and we generalize and simplify several known results from the literature on fair division, game theory, and competitive markets. In particular, we prove complexity results for two classic problems: Computing a market equilibrium in the Arrow–Debreu model with general concave utilities is in FIXP, and computing an envy-free division of a cake with very general valuations is FIXP-complete. We further showcase the wide applicability of our technique by using it to obtain simplified proofs and extensions of known FIXP-membership results for equilibrium computation for various types of strategic games as well as the pseudomarket mechanism of Hylland and Zeckhauser.",
