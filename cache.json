          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a priori and a posteriori error estimates of the tangential-displacement normal-normal-stress (TDNNS) method for linear elasticity problem with strongly symmetric stress tensors are proposed. The error estimator is established by decomposing the stress error into two components via the introduction of an auxiliary problem. The local efficiency of the error estimator is proved via bubble function techniques. Then, we derive a priori error estimates under minimal regularity. Classical methodologies rely on Galerkin orthogonality, which hinges on the well-defined trace variables on the inter-element boundaries. In order to circumvent the Galerkin orthogonality, an alternative methodology in the spirit of the medius analysis is established to prove the convergence error estimates for \n                      \n                      \\(L^2\\)\n                      \n                    -error of stress, mesh-dependent energy error of displacement and \n                      \n                      \\(L^2\\)\n                      \n                    -error of displacement.

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this series of works, we develop a discrete-velocity-direction model (DVDM) with collisions of BGK-type for simulating rarefied flows. Unlike the conventional kinetic models (both BGK and discrete-velocity models), the new model restricts the transport to finite fixed directions but leaves the transport speed to be a 1-D continuous variable. Analogous to the BGK equation, the discrete equilibriums of the model are determined by minimizing a discrete entropy. In this first paper, we introduce the DVDM and investigate its basic properties, including the existence of the discrete equilibriums and the H-theorem. We also show that the discrete equilibriums can be efficiently obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. The proposed model provides a new way in choosing discrete velocities for the computational practice of the conventional discrete-velocity methodology. It also facilitates a convenient multidimensional extension of the extended quadrature method of moments. We validate the model with numerical experiments for two benchmark problems at moderate computational costs.",

Specifically, we propose a mesh-free discretization technique based on the theory of reproducing kernels and the theory of transport mappings, in a way that is reminiscent of Lagrangian methods in computational fluid dynamics. We introduce kernel-based discretizations of a variety of differential and discrete operators (gradient, divergence, Laplacian, Leray projection, extrapolation, interpolation, polar factorization). The proposed algorithms are nonlinear in nature and enjoy quantitative error estimates based on the notion of discrepancy error, which allows one to evaluate the relevance and accuracy of, both, the given data and the numerical solutions. Our strategy is relevant when a large number of degrees of freedom are present as is the case in mathematical finance and machine learning. We consider the Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov system (relevant for problems arising in finance and material dynamics) and a class of neural networks based on support vector machines.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper we consider a steady phase change problem for non-isothermal incompressible viscous flow in porous media with an enthalpy-porosity-viscosity coupling mechanism, and introduce and analyze a Banach spaces-based variational formulation yielding a new mixed-primal finite element method for its numerical solution. The momentum and mass conservation equations are formulated in terms of velocity and the tensors of strain rate, vorticity, and stress; and the incompressibility constraint is used to eliminate the pressure, which is computed afterwards by a postprocessing formula depending on the stress and the velocity. The resulting continuous formulation for the flow becomes a nonlinear perturbation of a perturbed saddle point linear system. The energy conservation equation is written as a nonlinear primal formulation that incorporates the additional unknown of boundary heat flux. The whole mixed-primal formulation is regarded as a fixed-point operator equation, so that its well-posedness hinges on Banach’s theorem, along with smallness assumptions on the data. In turn, the solvability analysis of the uncoupled problem in the fluid employs the Babuška–Brezzi theory, a recently obtained result for perturbed saddle-point problems, and the Banach–Nečas–Babuška Theorem, all them in Banach spaces, whereas the one for the uncoupled energy equation applies a nonlinear version of the Babuška–Brezzi theory in Hilbert spaces. An analogue fixed-point strategy is employed for the analysis of the associated Galerkin scheme, using in this case Brouwer’s theorem and assuming suitable conditions on the respective discrete subspaces. The error analysis is conducted under appropriate assumptions, and selecting specific finite element families that fit the theory. We finally report on the verification of theoretical convergence rates with the help of numerical examples.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe propose a reduced-order model (ROM) based on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) for efficient reduced-order modeling of parameterized time-dependent partial differential equations. Given high-fidelity solutions for training time and parameter sets, a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is first used to extract the POD modes and the projection coefficients onto the modes. After that, a DMD model is built for each parameter value based on the corresponding projection coefficients. These DMD models are used to predict the projection coefficients over a larger time region than the training time region. We rearrange these predicted coefficients as a new matrix and perform POD again to decompose the matrix into time-dependent and parameter-dependent parts, which are approximated using cubic spline interpolation (CSI) and Gaussian process regression (GPR), respectively. Finally, the ROM solutions at any given time or parameter value are estimated by a simple multiplication of the POD modes and the approximated projection coefficients. The proposed method is tested through several benchmark problems, and the impact of using CSI and GPR to model the time-dependent part on the model accuracy is analyzed. In addition, numerical results for a PDE with 19 parameters demonstrate the great potential of the proposed method in the construction of a ROM for problems with high dimensional parameters.",

Then we propose a domain decomposition method for efficiently solving such a large complex system. Robin boundary conditions are used to decouple the Dual-Porosity equations from the Navier–Stokes equations in the coupled system. Based on the two decoupled sub-problems, a parallel Robin-Robin domain decomposition method is constructed and then discretized by finite elements. We analyze the convergence of the domain decomposition method with the finite element discretization and investigate the effect of Robin parameters on the convergence, which also provide instructions for how to choose the Robin parameters in practice. Three cases of Robin parameters are studied, including a difficult case which was not fully addressed in the literature, and the optimal geometric convergence rate is obtained. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the theoretical conclusions, illustrate how the theory can provide instructions on choosing Robin parameters, and show the features of the proposed model and domain decomposition method.",

Barnett has provided new bounds on the rate of ill-conditioning (Barnett in SIAM Rev 64:105–131, 2022). In this paper we focus on the corresponding singular value decomposition. The singular vectors can be computed from the so-called periodic discrete prolate spheroidal sequences, named in analogy to spheroidal wave functions which are associated with the continuous Fourier transform. Their numerical computation is hampered by the clustering of singular values. We collect and expand known results on the stable numerical computation of the singular value decomposition of Fourier submatrices. The prolate sequences are eigenvectors of a tridiagonal matrix whose spectrum is free of clusters and this enables their computation. We collect these observations in a simple and convenient algorithm. The corresponding singular values can be accurately computed as well, except when they are small. Even then, small singular values can be computed in high-precision arithmetic with modest computational effort, even for large and extremely ill-conditioned submatrices. We illustrate the computations and point out a few applications in which Fourier submatrices arise.",

          "description": "Abstract\nGaussian processes (GPs) are used for numerous different applications, including uncertainty quantification and optimization. Ill-conditioning of the covariance matrix for GPs is common with the use of various kernels, including the Gaussian, rational quadratic, and Matérn kernels. A common approach to overcome this problem is to add a nugget along the diagonal of the covariance matrix. For GPs that are not constructed with gradients, it is straightforward to derive a nugget value that guarantees the condition number of the covariance matrix to be below a user-set threshold. However, for gradient-enhanced GPs, there are no existing practical bounds to select a nugget that guarantee that the condition number of the gradient-enhanced covariance matrix is below a user-set threshold. In this paper a novel approach is taken to bound the condition number of the covariance matrix for GPs that use the Gaussian kernel. This is achieved by using non-isotropic rescaling for the data and a modest nugget value. This non-intrusive method works for GPs applied to problems of any dimension and it allows all data points to be kept. The method is applied to a Bayesian optimizer using a gradient-enhanced GP to achieve deep convergence. Without this method, the high condition number constrains the hyperparameters for the GP and this is shown to impede the convergence of the optimizer. It is also demonstrated that applying this method to the rational quadratic and Matérn kernels alleviates the ill-conditioning of their gradient-enhanced covariance matrices. Implementation of the method is straightforward and clearly described in the paper.",

This is the second paper in a series in which we develop machine learning (ML) moment closure models for the radiative transfer equation (RTE). In our previous work [J. Huang, Y. Cheng, A. J. Christlieb, and L. F. Roberts, J. Comput. Phys., 453 (2022), 110941], we proposed an approach to directly learn the spatial gradient of the unclosed high-order moment, which performs much better than learning the moment itself and the conventional [math] closure. However, the ML moment closure model in [J. Huang, Y. Cheng, A. J. Christlieb, and L. F. Roberts, J. Comput. Phys., 453 (2022), 110941] is not able to guarantee hyperbolicity and long time stability. We propose in this paper a method to enforce the global hyperbolicity of the ML closure model. The main idea is to seek a symmetrizer (a symmetric positive definite matrix) for the closure system and derive constraints such that the system is globally symmetrizable hyperbolic. It is shown that the new ML closure system inherits the dissipativeness of the RTE and preserves the correct diffusion limit as the Knudsen number goes to zero. Several benchmark tests including the Gaussian source problem and the two-material problem show the good accuracy, long time stability, and generalizability of our globally hyperbolic ML closure model.",

Reaction coordinates (RCs) are indicators of hidden, low-dimensional mechanisms that govern the long-term behavior of high-dimensional stochastic processes. We present a novel and general variational characterization of optimal RCs and provide conditions for their existence. Optimal RCs are minimizers of a certain loss function, and reduced models based on them guarantee a good approximation of the statistical long-term properties of the original high-dimensional process. We show that for slow-fast systems, metastable systems, and other systems with known good RCs, the novel theory reproduces previous insight. Remarkably, for reversible systems, the numerical effort required to evaluate the loss function scales only with the variability of the underlying, low-dimensional mechanism, and not with that of the full system. The theory provided lays the foundation for an efficient and data-sparse computation of RCs via modern machine learning techniques.",

The implication for the underlying biological system is robustness in the concentration of one of the species independent of the initial conditions as well as independent of the concentration of all other species. Identifying network conditions for dynamic ACR is a challenging problem. We lay the groundwork in this paper by studying small reaction networks, those with two reactions and two species.

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. Investigation of biological systems often requires reconstruction of an unobservable continuous process from discrete time-series data sampled from a related process or processes. When the reconstructed process cannot be validated with experimental data, it is particularly important to quantify the uncertainty on the inferred process, and new methodologies are needed to support both the inference and uncertainty quantification. This work derives a novel statistical model that combines an established differential model of intra- and extravascular C-peptide dynamics with a Gaussian process model of insulin secretion rate (ISR) in order to provide clinical measures of beta-cell function with quantified uncertainty. These measures are computed from the ISR that is inferred from measured C-peptide data. The model is first validated using synthetic data, and then applied to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) data from youth participants with and without cystic fibrosis (CF). Because CF is characterized by scarring and fibrosis of the pancreas, impairment of beta-cell function, rather than reduced insulin sensitivity, is implicated in the early etiology of CF-related diabetes (CFRD). ISR-derived measures of beta-cell function show worsening beta-cell function from healthy control to CF to CFRD groups consistent with previous reports on dysglycemia in CF. However, the model additionally allows uncertainty in the data to be propagated to ISR and ISR-derived measures of beta-cell function. These results provide insight into uncertainty in ISR-derived measures of beta cell function, characterize interindividual variability in CFRD etiology, and provide novel metrics to quantify the pathogenesis of CFRD.",

We propose an extension of the well-known Klausmeier model of vegetation to two plant species that consume water at different rates. Rather than competing directly, the plants compete through their intake of water, which is a shared resource between them. In semiarid regions, the Klausmeier model produces vegetation spot patterns. We are interested in how the competition for water affects the coexistence and stability of patches of different plant species. We consider two plant types—a “thirsty” species and a “frugal” species—that only differ by the amount of water they consume per unit growth, while being identical in other aspects. We find that there is a finite range of precipitation rate for which two species can coexist. Outside of that range (when the rate is either sufficiently low or high), the frugal species out-competes the thirsty species. As the precipitation rate is decreased, there is a sequence of stability thresholds such that thirsty plant patches are the first to die off, while the frugal spots remain resilient for longer. The pattern consisting of only frugal spots is the most resilient. The next most resilient pattern consists of all-thirsty patches, with the mixed pattern being less resilient than either of the homogeneous patterns. We also examine numerically what happens for very large precipitation rates. We find that for a sufficiently high rate, the frugal plant takes over the entire range, out-competing the thirsty plant.",

Let [math], [math], be a family of functions in [math], and [math] be a reconstruction of [math] from its discrete Radon transform data. Here [math] is both the data sampling rate and the parameter of the family. We study the resolution of reconstruction when [math] has a jump discontinuity along a nonsmooth curve [math]. The assumptions are that (a) [math] is a family of [math]-size perturbations of a smooth curve [math], and (b) [math] is Hölder continuous with some exponent [math]. Thus the size of the perturbation [math] is of the same order of magnitude as the data sampling rate. We compute the discrete transition behavior (DTB) defined as the limit [math], where [math] is generic. We illustrate the DTB by two sets of numerical experiments. In the first set, the perturbation is a smooth, rapidly oscillating sinusoid, and in the second, a fractal curve. The experiments reveal that the match between the DTB and reconstruction is worse as [math] gets rougher. This is in agreement with the proof of the DTB, which suggests that the rate of convergence to the limit is [math]. We then propose a new DTB, which exhibits an excellent agreement with reconstructions. Investigation of this phenomenon requires computing the rate of convergence for the new DTB. This, in turn, requires completely new approaches. We obtain a partial result along these lines and formulate a conjecture that the rate of convergence of the new DTB is [math].",

In this paper we investigate some electric, thermal, and thermoelectric properties of suspended monolayer graphene. By means of a numerical experiment, which was made employing a previously developed macroscopic model for charge and energy transport in graphene, we analyze how fast a suspended graphene sheet heats up when it is subject to a constant homogeneous electric field and how it reaches the equilibrium state once the electric field is turned off. We consider electrons and all phonon branches and show that the influence of the out-of-plane acoustical phonons on the final equilibrium temperature is notable due to their great surface heat capacity. The influence of the electrons on the equilibrium temperature depends on their density; in fact the higher it is, the more energy they gain from the electric field. The behavior of the system can be theoretically justified on the basis of two important physical properties: the conservation of the total energy and the increase of the total entropy of the electron-phonon system; of the latter we give an almost explicit expression. After that, we study the electronic thermal and electric conductivity and the thermopower by finding formulas which express them as functions of the electron and phonon temperatures and the electron density by using a suitable recasting of the macroscopic model in the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics.",

Boundary value problems for diffusion in singularly perturbed domains is a topic of considerable current interest. Applications include intracellular diffusive transport and the spread of pollutants or heat from localized sources. In a previous paper, we introduced a new method for characterizing the approach to steady state in the case of two-dimensional (2D) diffusion. This was based on a local measure of the relaxation rate known as the accumulation time [math]. The latter was calculated by solving the diffusion equation in Laplace space using a combination of matched asymptotics and Green’s function methods. We thus obtained an asymptotic expansion of [math] in powers of [math], where [math] specifies the relative size of the holes. In this paper, we develop the corresponding theory for three-dimensional (3D) diffusion. The analysis is a nontrivial extension of the 2D case due to differences in the singular nature of the Laplace transformed Green’s function. In particular, the asymptotic expansion of the solution of the 3D diffusion equation in Laplace space involves terms of order [math], where [math] is the Laplace variable. These [math]-singularities have to be removed by partial series resummations in order to obtain an asymptotic expansion of [math] in powers of [math].",

A family of results, referred to as inheritance results, tell us which enlargements of a chemical reaction network (CRN) preserve its capacity for nontrivial behaviours such as multistationarity and oscillation. In this paper, the following inheritance result is proved: under mild assumptions, splitting chemical reactions and inserting complexes involving some new chemical species preserves the capacity of a mass action CRN for multiple nondegenerate equilibria and/or periodic orbits. The claim has been proved previously for equilibria alone; however, the generalisation to include oscillation involves extensive development of rather different techniques. Several inheritance results for multistationarity and oscillation in mass action CRNs, including the main result of this paper, are gathered into a single theorem. Examples are presented showing how these results can be used together to make claims about reaction networks based on knowledge of their subnetworks.

The reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) is a lattice-based stochastic model for spatially resolved cellular processes.

Analyzing and understanding the relation between different mathematical models for reaction-diffusion dynamics is a research topic of steady interest. In this work, we explore a route to the hydrodynamic limit of the RDME which uses gradient structures. Specifically, we elaborate on a method introduced in [J. Maas and A. Mielke, J. Stat.

Asymptotic methods are employed to analyze earlier two-phase steady-state Euler–Euler models that were originally intended as simplified representations for gas-solid flow in an ironmaking blast furnace; more generally, however, they can be thought of as models for two-phase flow in countercurrent moving bed reactors. A scaling analysis, based around the fact that the solid velocity is typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the gas velocity, indicates that the effects of viscosity and inertia are basically negligible compared with those of gravity and interphase momentum transfer. The resulting reduced model yields quasi-analytical expressions for the solid fraction and the gas velocity, with the former being directly related to the shapes of the reactor and any stagnant zone that may form as a consequence of solids or granular materials being able to withstand substantial amounts of shear; in ironmaking blast furnaces, this occurs near the bottom of the reactor, and the zone is commonly known as the deadman. On the other hand, the solid velocity can be found via a numerical solution of Laplace’s equation; nevertheless, the solution is different to that obtained from earlier potential flow models in blast furnace modeling. Most significantly, the current model would form the basis of a computationally efficient approach for modeling transient heat and mass transfer with chemical reactions in a countercurrent moving bed reactor.",

In this paper, we theoretically and computationally show that the increase of heterogeneity signals predeterioration during tumor progression by unified random ordinary differential equations (RODEs). Tumor formation results from a systematic change in organisms, and its causality is complex. Heterogeneity may be one of the key factors under some conditions. Specifically, the interactions between cell populations are modeled by random community matrices in normal tissues, benign tumors, and malignant tumors, and then we prove that the RODEs system describing the cell density of normal tissues or benign tumors becomes unstable as heterogeneity of cell populations or species increases. The increase of heterogeneity is an important signal. Heterogeneity can be viewed as a feature to distinguish benign tumors from malignant tumors under certain circumstances. Furthermore, we show that with the increase of heterogeneity, the divergence speed of the RODEs system becomes faster, which implies that malignant tumors with higher heterogeneity may develop faster and have poorer prognoses. Our theoretical findings can explain some noteworthy phenomena in various datasets in tumor patients and our biological experiments in mice from a mathematical viewpoint. Particularly, clinical data and mutation information from the cancer genome atlas and our experiments in mice revealed that tumors with higher heterogeneity usually show shorter survival time, whereas tumors with lower heterogeneity tend to have better prognosis, which also indicates that heterogeneity can be used as a potential biomarker in future clinical diagnosis. Targeting the heterogeneity may be a potential strategy for the cancer treatment.",

We propose a mathematical theory of acoustic wave scattering in one-dimensional finite high-contrast media.

We prove the existence of subwavelength resonances, which are the counterparts of the well-known Minnaert resonances in three-dimensional systems. One of the main contribution of the paper is to show that the resonant frequencies as well as the transmission and reflection properties of the system can be accurately predicted by a “capacitance” eigenvalue problem, analogously to the three-dimensional setting. Moreover, we discover new properties which are peculiar to the one-dimensional setting, notably the tridiagonal structure of the capacitance matrix as well as the fact that the first resonant frequency is always exactly zero, implying a low-pass filtering property of a one-dimensional chain of resonators. Numerical results considering different situations with [math] to [math] resonators are provided to support our mathematical analysis and to illustrate the various possibilities offered by high-contrast resonators to manipulate waves at subwavelength scales.",

Then the approximations of the unknown functions can be obtained from a system of linear algebraic equations. Accuracy of the numerical procedure is studied.

Social insects are ecologically and evolutionarily the most successful organisms on earth and can achieve robust collective behaviors through local interactions among group members. Colony migration has been considered as a leading example of collective decision making in social insects. In this paper, a piecewise colony migration system with recruitment switching is proposed to explore underlying mechanisms and synergistic effects of colony size and quorum on the outcomes of collective decision. The dynamical behavior of the nonsmooth system is studied, and sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of equilibrium are provided. The theoretical results suggest that large colonies are more likely to emigrate to a new site. More interesting findings include but are not limited to that (a) the system may exhibit oscillation when the colony size is below a critical level and (b) the system may also exhibit a bistable state, i.e., the colony migrates to a new site or the old nest depending on the initial size of recruiters. Bifurcation analysis shows that the variations of colony size and quorum threshold greatly impact the dynamics. The results suggest that it is important to distinguish between two populations of recruiters in modeling.

Cell-cell adhesion is one the most fundamental mechanisms regulating collective cell migration during tissue development, homeostasis, and repair, allowing cell populations to self-organize and eventually form and maintain complex tissue shapes. Cells interact with each other via the formation of protrusions or filopodia and they adhere to other cells through binding of cell surface proteins. The resulting adhesive forces are then related to cell size and shape and, often, continuum models represent them by nonlocal attractive interactions. In this paper, we present a new continuum model of cell-cell adhesion which can be derived from a general nonlocal model in the limit of short-range interactions. This new model is local, resembling a system of thin-film type equations, with the various model parameters playing the role of surface tensions between different cell populations. Numerical simulations in one and two dimensions reveal that the local model maintains the diversity of cell sorting patterns observed both in experiments and in previously used nonlocal models. In addition, it also has the advantage of having explicit stationary solutions, which provides a direct link between the model parameters and the differential adhesion hypothesis.",

By introducing the so called “minimal state variable” and using semigroup theories, the system is proved to be well-posed. It is found that this kind of memory term still acts as a damping to some extent under certain conditions, but its damping effect is too weak to indirectly stabilize the system exponentially. Based on frequency domain analysis, it is further proved that this system can be indirectly stabilized polynomially by only one friction-type infinite memory term located on one of these strongly coupled PDEs.

We study the Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow with a common noise on the density manifold of a finite graph. Under the framework of the stochastic variational principle, we first develop the formulation of stochastic Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow and show the local existence of a unique solution. We also establish a sufficient condition for the global existence of the solution. Consequently, we obtain the global well-posedness for the nonlinear Schrödinger equations with common noise on a graph. In addition, using Wong–Zakai approximation of common noise, we prove the existence of the minimizer for an optimal control problem with common noise. We show that its minimizer satisfies the stochastic Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow on a graph as well.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Volume 83, Issue 2, Page 460-483, April 2023. \n Abstract. Modeling diffusive processes via a constant effective diffusivity value taken to represent realistic uncertainty or heterogeneity is entrenched in scientific and engineering applications. This brings forth the question, to what extent does the flow pattern changes when symmetry is broken by anisotropy. This study supplies the answer by deriving a class of tridimensional solutions to the steady nonlinear diffusion equation in a spherical domain divided into an arbitrary number of meridian sectors with distinct diffusivities and generation rates. The new family of solutions permits flexible modeling, where traditionally only isotropic radial transport was considered. The flow patterns support an extensive variety of topological terrain via tesseral and sectoral harmonics. The anisotropy gives rise to an unconventional type of a fixed point combining both node and saddle attributes. The contours are nonsmooth on the contiguity planes between sectors and might or might not be localized in the polar angle [math] and/or azimuthal angle [math], implying a particle might remain confined to a relatively small neighborhood or meander over the sphere. The impact on motion trajectories and thus transport efficiency implies that the energy required to sustain a steady flow is starkly underestimated when symmetry is assumed for simplicity despite the presence of anisotropy.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Volume 83, Issue 2, Page 436-459, April 2023. \n Abstract. Mean-field equations have been developed recently to approximate the dynamics of the Deffuant model of opinion formation. These equations can describe both fully mixed populations and the case where individuals interact only along edges of a network. In each case, interactions only occur between individuals whose opinions differ by less than a given parameter, called the confidence bound. The size of the confidence bound parameter is known to strongly affect both the dynamics and the number and location of opinion clusters. In this work, we carry out a mathematical analysis of the mean-field equations to investigate the role of the confidence bound and boundaries on these important observables of the model. We consider the limit in which the confidence bound interval is small, and we identify the key mechanisms driving opinion evolution. We show that linear stability analysis can predict the number and location of opinion clusters. Comparison with numerical simulations of the model illustrates that the early-time dynamics and the final cluster locations can be accurately approximated for networks composed of two degree classes, as well as for the case of a fully mixed population.",

Our algorithm revolves around dynamically maintaining the augmenting electrical flows at the core of the interior point method based algorithm from Ma̧dry [Proceedings of the 57th IEEE Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2016, pp. 593–602].

We show that these problems are all polynomial-time equivalent, creating bridges between problems traditionally studied in myriad research areas. This prompts us to define the complexity class [math], namely problems that reduce to the tensor isomorphism problem in polynomial time. Our main technical result is a polynomial-time reduction from [math]-tensor isomorphism to 3-tensor isomorphism. In the context of quantum information, this result gives a multipartite-to-tripartite entanglement transformation procedure that preserves equivalence under stochastic local operations and classical communication.",

We prove that for every decision tree, the absolute values of the Fourier coefficients of a given order [math] sum to at most [math], where [math] is the number of variables, [math] is the tree depth, and [math] is an absolute constant. This bound is essentially tight and settles a conjecture due to Tal [Towards optimal separations between quantum and randomized query complexities, in Proceedings of the Sixty-First Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2020, pp. 228–239]. The bounds prior to our work degraded rapidly with [math], becoming trivial already at [math]. As an application, we obtain, for every integer [math], a partial Boolean function on [math] bits that has bounded-error quantum query complexity at most [math] and randomized query complexity [math]. This separation of bounded-error quantum versus randomized query complexity is best possible, by the results of Aaronson and Ambainis [SIAM J. Comput., 47 (2018), pp. 982–1038] and Bravyi et al. [Classical Algorithms for Forrelation, arXiv preprint, 2021]. Prior to our work, the best known separation was polynomially weaker: [math] versus [math] for any [math] [A. Tal, Towards optimal separations between quantum and randomized query complexities, in Proceedings of the Sixty-First Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2020, pp. 228–239]. As another application, we obtain an essentially optimal separation of [math] versus [math] for bounded-error quantum versus randomized communication complexity for any [math]. The best previous separation was polynomially weaker: [math] versus [math] (this is implicit in [A. Tal, Towards optimal separations between quantum and randomized query complexities, in Proceedings of the Sixty-First Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2020, pp. 228–239]).",
