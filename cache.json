          "description": "Abstract\nTransfer learning for partial differential equations (PDEs) is to develop a pre-trained neural network that can be used to solve a wide class of PDEs. Existing transfer learning approaches require much information about the target PDEs such as its formulation and/or data of its solution for pre-training. In this work, we propose to design transferable neural feature spaces for the shallow neural networks from purely function approximation perspectives without using PDE information. The construction of the feature space involves the re-parameterization of the hidden neurons and uses auxiliary functions to tune the resulting feature space. Theoretical analysis shows the high quality of the produced feature space, i.e., uniformly distributed neurons. We use the proposed feature space as the pre-determined feature space of a random feature model, and use existing least squares solvers to obtain the weights of the output layer. Extensive numerical experiments verify the outstanding performance of our method, including significantly improved transferability, e.g., using the same feature space for various PDEs with different domains and boundary conditions, and the superior accuracy, e.g., several orders of magnitude smaller mean squared error than the state of the art methods.",

          "description": "Abstract\nFirst-order hydrostatic reconstruction (HR) schemes for shallow water equations are highly diffusive whereas high-order schemes can produce entropy-violating solutions. Our goal is to develop a flux correction with maximum antidiffusive fluxes to obtain entropy solutions of shallow water equations with variable bottom topography. For this purpose, we consider a hybrid explicit HR scheme whose flux is a convex combination of first-order Rusanov flux and high-order flux. The conditions under which the explicit first-order HR scheme for shallow water equations satisfies the fully discrete entropy inequality have been studied. The flux limiters for the hybrid scheme are calculated from a corresponding optimization problem. Constraints for the optimization problem consist of inequalities that are valid for the first-order HR scheme and applied to the hybrid scheme. We apply the discrete cell entropy inequality with the proper numerical entropy flux to single out a physically relevant solution to the shallow water equations. A nontrivial approximate solution of the optimization problem yields expressions to compute the required flux limiters. Numerical results of testing various HR schemes on different benchmarks are presented.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe develop a distributed Block Chebyshev-Davidson algorithm to solve large-scale leading eigenvalue problems for spectral analysis in spectral clustering. First, the efficiency of the Chebyshev-Davidson algorithm relies on the prior knowledge of the eigenvalue spectrum, which could be expensive to estimate. This issue can be lessened by the analytic spectrum estimation of the Laplacian or normalized Laplacian matrices in spectral clustering, making the proposed algorithm very efficient for spectral clustering. Second, to make the proposed algorithm capable of analyzing big data, a distributed and parallel version has been developed with attractive scalability. The speedup by parallel computing is approximately equivalent to \n                      \n                      \\(\\sqrt{p}\\)\n                      \n                    , where p denotes the number of processes.

          "description": "Abstract\nWe propose an Eulerian–Lagrangian (EL) Runge–Kutta (RK) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for a linear hyperbolic system. The method is designed based on the ELDG method for transport problems (J Comput Phys 446:110,632, 2021), which tracks solutions along approximations to characteristics in the DG framework, allowing extra large time stepping sizes with stability with respect to the classical RKDG method. Considering each characteristic family, a straightforward application of ELDG for the hyperbolic system will be to transform to the characteristic variables, evolve them on associated characteristic-related space–time regions, and transform them back to the original variables. However, the conservation could not be guaranteed in a general setting. In this paper, we formulate a conservative semi-discrete ELDG method by decomposing each variable into two parts, each of them associated with a different characteristic family. As a result, four different quantities are evolved in EL fashion and recombined to update the solution. The fully discrete scheme is formulated by using method-of-lines RK methods, with intermediate RK solutions updated on the background mesh. Numerical results for 1D and 2D wave equations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed ELDG method. These include the high order spatial and temporal accuracy, stability with extra large time stepping size, and conservative property.",

          "description": "Abstract\nFor magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, the existing entropy stable (ES) flux effectively eliminates the spurious oscillation, but it still has potential for improvement such as the resolution of discontinuous solutions. We propose a high-resolution scheme based on a moving mesh strategy for approximating solutions of ideal MHD and shallow water MHD (SWMHD) in this paper. Firstly, a new S-M flux limiter is constructed to weigh the ES flux and the anti-diffusive flux to obtain a new flux with high resolution and entropy stability properties. By adjusting the amplitude of anti-diffusive flux adaptively, the new flux can reduce its dissipation in smooth regions and increase dissipation at discontinuities, which is more consistent with physical laws. Secondly, we introduce the moving mesh strategy to optimize mesh generation and eliminate the defects of structured mesh. A new monitor function is defined to identify structural features of solutions at each particular time level and to assign appropriate weights to all regions with large numerical solution gradients, to construct a mesh evolution equation and increase the mesh density of these regions. Finally, we combine the moving mesh strategy with the high-resolution ES scheme and evaluate more accurate solutions according to the order of “mesh redistribution-update of solution-equation solving on new mesh”. Numerical results show that the new algorithm can achieve strong robustness and high resolution, and can track various waves effectively (especially the shock and rarefaction waves).",

The approach is based on the combination of Nyström discretization, analytical singular integrals and kernel-splitting method, which results in a high-order solver for smooth boundaries. It is then combined with the recursively compressed inverse preconditioning (RCIP) method to solve elastic scattering problems from cornered domains. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy, with stabilized errors close to machine precision in various geometric configurations. The algorithm is further applied to investigate the asymptotic behavior of density functions associated with boundary integral operators near corners, and the numerical results are highly consistent with the theoretical formulas.",

The aim of this work is to establish a novel framework of Monte Carlo integration over simplices, throughout from sampling to variance reduction. Namely, we develop a uniform sampling method on the standard simplex consisting of two independent procedures and construct theories on change of measure on each of the two independent elements in the developed sampling technique with a view towards variance reduction by importance sampling. We provide illustrative figures and numerical results to support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the strong potential of the developed framework for effective implementation and acceleration of Monte Carlo integration over simplices.",

We mimic the continuous entropy analysis on the semi-discrete level with the DGSEM constructed on Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto (LGL) nodes. The use of LGL nodes endows the collocated nodal DGSEM with the summation-by-parts property that is key in the discrete analysis. The approximation exploits an equivalent flux differencing formulation for the volume contributions, which generate an entropy conservative split-form of the governing equations. A specific combination of a numerical surface flux and discretization of the nonconservative terms is then applied to obtain a high-order path-conservative scheme that is entropy conservative. Furthermore, we find that this combination yields an analogous discretization for the pressure and nonconservative terms such that the numerical method is well-balanced for discontinuous bathymetry on curvilinear domains. Dissipation is added at the interfaces to create an entropy stable approximation that satisfies the second law of thermodynamics in the discrete case, while maintaining the well-balanced property. We conclude with verification of the theoretical findings through numerical tests and demonstrate results about convergence, entropy stability and well-balancedness of the scheme.",

Our variables allow for a well-suited formulation in action-angle type coordinates associated with the averaged angles, which provide geometric insight into the problem. After introducing extra fictitious variables and through a symplectic transformation, we move to a singularity-free quaternionic triple-chart. This choice allows for a global chart to avoid the classical singularities associated with angles and renders all the invariants as homogeneous quadratic polynomials. Additionally, it permits one to quickly write the Hamiltonian of the system in terms of the invariants and the Poisson structure at each stage of the reduction process. In contrast with existing literature, the geometrical approach of this research completely describes all the dynamical aspects of the full reduced space since it involves the relative position of the rotational and orbital angular momenta and their orientation, which has yet to be considered in previous studies. Our program includes a preliminary parametric analysis of relative equilibria and a complete description of the fibers in the reconstruction of the reduced system.",

We analyze and quantify the amount of heat generated by a nanoparticle, injected in a background medium, while excited by incident electromagnetic waves. These nanoparticles are dispersive with electric permittivity following the Lorentz model. The purpose is to determine the quantity of heat generated extremely close to the nanoparticle (at a distance proportional to the radius of the nanoparticle). This study extends our previous results, derived in the 2D TM and TE regimes, to the full Maxwell system. We show that by exciting the medium with incident frequencies close to the plasmonic or Dielectric resonant frequencies, we can generate any desired amount of heat close to the injected nanoparticle while the amount of heat decreases away from it. These results offer a wide range of potential applications in the areas of photo-thermal therapy, drug delivery, and material science, to cite a few. To do so, we employ time-domain integral equations and asymptotic analysis techniques to study the corresponding mathematical model for heat generation. This model is given by the heat equation where the body source term comes from the modulus of the electric field generated by the used incident electromagnetic field. Therefore, we first analyze the dominant term of this electric field by studying the full Maxwell scattering problem in the presence of plasmonic or all-dielectric nanoparticles. As a second step, we analyze the propagation of this dominant electric field in the estimation of the heat potential. For both the electromagnetic and parabolic models, the presence of the nanoparticles is translated into the appearance of large scales in the contrasts for the heat-conductivity (for the parabolic model) and the permittivity (for the full Maxwell system) between the nanoparticle and its surroundings.",

Perhaps more importantly, we provide the first numerical calculations of scattering phases for nonradial scatterers.

In particular, the conditions that can ensure the occurrence of approximate cloaks and shields for general geometries are also established.

In the Maximum Independent Set problem we are asked to find a set of pairwise nonadjacent vertices in a given graph with the maximum possible cardinality. In general graphs, this classical problem is known to be NP-hard and hard to approximate within a factor of [math] for any [math]. Due to this, investigating the complexity of Maximum Independent Set in various graph classes in hope of finding better tractability results is an active research direction. In [math]-free graphs, that is, graphs not containing a fixed graph [math] as an induced subgraph, the problem is known to remain NP-hard and APX-hard whenever [math] contains a cycle, a vertex of degree at least four, or two vertices of degree at least three in one connected component. For the remaining cases, where every component of [math] is a path or a subdivided claw, the complexity of Maximum Independent Set remains widely open, with only a handful of polynomial-time solvability results for small graphs [math] such as [math], [math], the claw, or the fork. We prove that for every such “possibly tractable” graph [math] there exists an algorithm that, given an [math]-free graph [math] and an accuracy parameter [math], finds an independent set in [math] of cardinality within a factor of [math] of the optimum in time exponential in a polynomial of [math] and [math]. Furthermore, an independent set of maximum size can be found in subexponential time [math]. That is, we show that for every graph [math] for which Maximum Independent Set is not known to be APX-hard and SUBEXP-hard in [math]-free graphs, the problem admits a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme and a subexponential-time exact algorithm in this graph class. Our algorithms also work in the more general weighted setting, where the input graph is supplied with a weight function on vertices and we are maximizing the total weight of an independent set.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 53, Issue 1, Page 1-46, February 2024. \n Abstract. We consider the problem of finding nearly optimal solutions of optimization problems with random objective functions. Such problems arise widely in the theory of random graphs, theoretical computer science, and statistical physics. Two concrete problems we consider are (a) optimizing the Hamiltonian of a spherical or Ising [math]-spin glass model and (b) finding a large independent set in a sparse Erdős–Rényi graph. The following families of algorithms are considered: (a) low-degree polynomials of the input—a general framework that captures many prior algorithms; (b) low-depth Boolean circuits; (c) the Langevin dynamics algorithm, a canonical Monte Carlo analogue of the gradient descent algorithm. We show …",
