          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper introduces a conjugate gradients (CG) acceleration of the coordinate descent algorithm (CD) for linear systems. It is shown that the Kaczmarz algorithm (KACZ) can simulate CD exactly, so CD can be accelerated by CG similarly to the CG acceleration of KACZ (Björck and Elfving in BIT 19:145–163, 1979). Experimental results were carried out on large sets of problems of reconstructing bandlimited functions from random sampling. The randomness causes extreme variance between different instances of these problems, thus causing extreme variance in the advantage of CGCD over CD. The reduction of the number of iterations by CGCD varies from about 50–90% and beyond. The implementation of CGCD is simple. CGCD can also be used for the parallel solution of linear systems derived from partial differential equations, and for the efficient solution of multiple right-hand-side problems and matrix inversion.",

We derive residual a posteriori error estimates for each friction model, following (Chouly et al., in IMA J Numer Anal 38: 921–954, 2018). For the incomplete variant of Nitsche, we prove an upper bound for the dual norm of the residual, for Tresca and Coulomb friction, without any extra regularity and without a saturation assumption.

          "description": "Abstract\nWe design a monotone meshfree finite difference method for linear elliptic equations in the non-divergence form on point clouds via a nonlocal relaxation method. The key idea is a novel combination of a nonlocal integral relaxation of the PDE problem with a robust meshfree discretization on point clouds. Minimal positive stencils are obtained through a local \n                      \n                      \\(l_1\\)\n                      \n                    -type optimization procedure that automatically guarantees the stability and, therefore, the convergence of the meshfree discretization for linear elliptic equations. A major theoretical contribution is the existence of consistent and positive stencils for a given point cloud geometry. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of positive stencils by finding neighbors within an ellipse (2d) or ellipsoid (3d) surrounding each interior point, generalizing the study for Poisson’s equation by Seibold (Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 198(3–4):592–601, 2008). It is well-known that wide stencils are in general needed for constructing consistent and monotone finite difference schemes for linear elliptic equations. Our result represents a significant improvement in the stencil width estimate for positive-type finite difference methods for linear elliptic equations in the near-degenerate regime (when the ellipticity constant becomes small), compared to previously known works in this area. Numerical algorithms and practical guidance are provided with an eye on the case of small ellipticity constant. At the end, we present numerical results for the performance of our method in both 2d and 3d, examining a range of ellipticity constants including the near-degenerate regime.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThis work focuses on the robust and high-order numerical simulations of weakly compressible two-phase flows by using the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method combined with an explicit strong-stability-preserving Runge–Kutta scheme. In order to improve the computational robustness under large density ratios, a nonlinear weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) limiter and a positivity-preserving limiter are specially designed and applied with the aim of dampening the nonphysical oscillations around the phase interface and preventing the occurrence of negative density, respectively. More importantly, we theoretically prove that the present method is able to satisfy the uniform-pressure–velocity criterion which states that uniform pressure and velocity profiles around an isolated phase interface should be preserved during the simulation. The performance of the present method is validated by a range of benchmark test cases with density ratios up to 1000:1. The results demonstrate that the present method possesses a good capability of simulating weakly compressible two-phase flows with large density ratios.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a hybrid Hermite weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme is proposed for nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations which may contain discontinuity in the solution. The present scheme is constructed by applying the hybrid HWENO method based on the zero- and first-order moment with DDG flux to discrete the diffusion term in spatial direction and the third-order TVD Runge–Kutta method in temporal direction. A troubled-cell indicator is first used to identify the cells in which the discontinuity may exist, then the first-order moment in the troubled-cell is reconstructed by fifth-order HWENO scheme. To avoid spurious oscillation, the HWENO reconstruction is performed when the reconstruction stencils contain troubled-cell, otherwise linear reconstruction is performed straightforwardly. Compared with WENO schemes, the present scheme has advantages: (1) compactness, only immediate neighbor cells are used in the reconstruction procedure; (2) accuracy, the numerical errors by the present scheme are smaller than those by WENO schemes. Some benchmarks for one- and two-dimensional parabolic equations to demonstrate the high order accuracy and non-oscillatory performance of the present scheme.",

The new method is cast in a Bayesian framework and uses a prior that simultaneously incorporates intra-image information to promote sparsity in each individual edge map with inter-image information to promote similarities in any unchanged regions. By treating both the edges as well as the similarity between adjacent images as random variables, there is no need to separately form regions of change. Thus we avoid both additional computational cost as well as any information loss resulting from pre-processing the image. Our numerical examples demonstrate that our new method compares favorably with more standard SBL approaches.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a new limiter namely the compact weighted biased average procedure (CWBAP) is proposed for the shock capturing of high-order finite volume methods on unstructured girds. The new feature of this limiter is that all its operations are based on the information within a compact stencil. This limiter is an improvement of the original weighted biased average procedure (WBAP) which is not compact due to its successive limiting feature when applied to high-order schemes. This improvement mainly relies on two new techniques: a successive secondary reconstruction and a two-step WBAP limiter. The new limiter can preserve the original order of accuracy of the high-order finite volume schemes when simulating smooth flow without shock waves, and it shows improvements in accuracy, resolution and convergence property over the original WBAP limiter according to the numerical results of a number of test cases. Furthermore, the compactness of this limiter reduces the amount of data transfer in parallel computing. When implemented into the newly developed high-order finite volume schemes based on the compact stencil, the efficiency of the parallel computing can be effectively improved.",

          "description": "Abstract\nRestoring natural images corrupted by Cauchy noise is a challenging issue in image processing. In the existing methods, the traditional model-driven and filter-based methods can not recover the images well, and the learning-based plug-and-play method lacks convergence guarantees. In this paper, we propose a convergent plug-and-play method with outliers detection (C-PnPO) to remove Cauchy noise. The outlier detection is based on an outlier map regularized by maximum entropy. Due to the statistical properties of Cauchy distribution and the implicit deep image priors, the problem is non-convex and implicit. We present a convergent algorithm to address these issues by an adaptively relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers. Theoretically, we give some useful mathematical properties, including the existence of solutions under mild assumptions, and the global linear convergence of the proposed method by an adaptive relaxation strategy. Experimental results show that the outliers can be successfully detected, and the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-art traditional and learning-based methods both in terms of quantitative and qualitative comparisons.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we develop a new free-stream preserving (FP) method for high-order upwind conservative finite-difference (FD) schemes on curvilinear grids. This FP method is constructed by subtracting a reference cell-face flow state from each cell-center value in the local stencil of the original upwind schemes, which effectively leads to a reformulated dissipation. It is convenient to implement this method, as it only approximates the cell-center fluxes and conservative variables before reconstructions rather than performs the FP techniques for the central and dissipation parts individually, which avoids introducing considerable complexities to the original reconstruction procedures. In addition, the proposed method removes the constraint in the traditional FP conservative FD schemes that require a consistent scheme for the metrics discretization and the central part of fluxes discretization. With this, the proposed method is more flexible in simulating the engineering problems which usually require a low-order scheme for their low-quality mesh, while the high-order schemes can be applied to approximate the flow states to improve the resolution. After demonstrating the strict FP property and the order of accuracy by two simple test cases, we consider various validation cases, including the supersonic flow around the cylinder, the subsonic flow past the three-element airfoil, and the transonic flow around the ONERA M6 wing, etc., to show that the method is suitable for a wide range of fluid dynamic problems containing complex geometries.",

Anal., 52 (2014), pp. 1525–1550] to compute ground states of Bose–Einstein condensates by finding discrete minimizers of the Gross–Pitaevskii energy functional. The established convergence rates for the method appeared, however, suboptimal compared to numerical observations and a proof of optimal rates in this setting remained open. In this paper we shall close this gap by proving optimal order error estimates for the [math]- and [math]-errors between the exact ground state and discrete minimizers, as well as error estimates for the ground state energy and the ground state eigenvalue. In particular, the achieved convergence rates for the energy and the eigenvalue are of 6th order with respect to the mesh size on which the discrete LOD space is based, without making any additional regularity assumptions. These high rates justify the use of very coarse meshes, which significantly reduces the computational effort for finding accurate approximations of ground states. In addition, we include numerical experiments that confirm the optimality of the new theoretical convergence rates, for both smooth and discontinuous potentials.",

Multisite phosphorylation is a signaling mechanism well known to give rise to multiple steady states, a property termed multistationarity. When phosphorylation occurs in a sequential and distributive manner, we obtain a family of networks indexed by the number of phosphorylation sites [math]. This work addresses the problem of understanding the parameter region where this family of networks displays multistationarity, by focusing on the projection of this region onto the set of kinetic parameters. The problem is phrased in the context of real algebraic geometry and reduced to studying whether a polynomial, defined as the determinant of a parametric matrix of size three, attains negative values over the positive orthant. The coefficients of the polynomial are functions of the kinetic parameters. For any [math], we provide sufficient conditions for the polynomial to be positive and, hence, preclude multistationarity, and also sufficient conditions for it to attain negative values and, hence, enable multistationarity. These conditions are derived by exploiting the structure of the polynomial and its Newton polytope and employing circuit polynomials. A relevant consequence of our results is that the sets of kinetic parameters that enable or preclude multistationarity are both connected for all [math].",

For a mechanical system consisting of a rotator and a pendulum coupled via a small, time-periodic Hamiltonian perturbation, the Arnold diffusion problem asserts the existence of “diffusing orbits” along which the energy of the rotator grows by an amount independent of the size of the coupling parameter, for all sufficiently small values of the coupling parameter. There is a vast literature on establishing Arnold diffusion for such systems. In this work, we consider the case when an additional, dissipative perturbation is added to the rotator-pendulum system with coupling. Therefore, the system obtained is not symplectic but conformally symplectic. We provide explicit conditions on the dissipation parameter, so that the resulting system still exhibits energy growth. The fact that Arnold diffusion may play a role in systems with small dissipation was conjectured by Chirikov. In this work, the coupling is carefully chosen, but the mechanism we present can be adapted to general couplings, and we will deal with the general case in future work.",

These graphs generalize the notion of classical square infinite lattices and our results complement those for bistable lattice equations on [math]. Using comparison principles and explicit lower and upper solutions, we show that wave solutions are pinned for small diffusion parameters. Upon increasing the diffusion, the wave starts to travel with nonzero speed, in a direction that depends on the detuning parameter. However, once the diffusion is sufficiently strong, the wave propagates in a single direction up the tree irrespective of the detuning parameter. In particular, our results imply that changes to the diffusion parameter can lead to a reversal of the propagation direction.",

The overexploitation of natural resources by our industrial society questions its long-term sustainability. Recently, a simple nature-society interrelation model, called the HANDY (Human And Nature DYnamics) model, has been proposed by Motesharrei, Rivas, and Kalnay [Ecol. Econ., 101 (2014), pp. 90–102] to address this concern with a special emphasis on the role of the stratification of the society. In this paper we analyze the dynamics of this model, and we explore the influence of two parameters: the nature depletion rate and the inequality factor. We characterize the asymptotic states of the system through a bifurcation analysis, and we derive several quantitative predictions. We show that some collapses are irreversible and, depending on the wealth production factor, bistability regimes can be obtained. In particular, a sustainable equilibrium can coexist with cycles of prosperity and collapse. We discuss the possible policies to prevent undesirable fates.",

The paper discusses the long-term asymptotic behavior of solutions and its dependence on the structure and parameters of perturbations. In particular, it is shown that perturbed trajectories can tend to the equilibrium of the limiting system or that new stochastically stable states can arise.

How does a group of agents break indecision when deciding about options with qualities that are hard to distinguish? Biological and artificial multiagent systems, from honeybees and bird flocks to bacteria, robots, and humans, often need to overcome indecision when choosing among options in situations in which the performance or even the survival of the group is at stake. Breaking indecision is also important because in a fully indecisive state, where agents are not biased toward any specific option, the agent group is maximally sensitive and prone to adapt to inputs and changes in its environment. Here, we develop a mathematical theory to study how decisions arise from the breaking of indecision. Our approach is grounded in both equivariant and network bifurcation theory. We model decision from indecision as synchrony-breaking in influence networks in which each node is the value assigned by an agent to an option. First, we show that three universal decision behaviors, namely, deadlock, consensus, and dissensus, are the generic outcomes of synchrony-breaking bifurcations from a fully synchronous state of indecision in influence networks. Second, we show that all deadlock and consensus value patterns and some dissensus value patterns are predicted by the symmetry of the influence networks. Third, we show that there are also many “exotic” dissensus value patterns. These patterns are predicted by network architecture but not by network symmetries through a new synchrony-breaking branching lemma. This is the first example of exotic solutions in an application. Numerical simulations of a novel influence network model illustrate our theoretical results.",

The goal of this study is to develop a computer-assisted method for proving the existence of periodic solutions for state-dependent delayed perturbations of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We assume that the unperturbed ODE has an isolated periodic orbit, and derive a set of polynomial inequalities which, if satisfied, imply the existence and uniqueness of a periodic solution in the perturbed system. A general procedure is given, which facilitates the computation of the polynomial coefficients and the optimization of the inputs necessary to satisfy the inequalities on an explicit range of the perturbing parameter. Our approach uses tools from validated numerics and interval arithmetic together with Chebyshev series expansions to obtain the periodic orbit of the ODE as well as the solution of the variational equations. The general procedure is illustrated by proving the existence of some periodic orbits in state-dependent delayed perturbations of the van der Pol equation.",

Fluids subject to both thermal and compositional variations can undergo doubly diffusive convection when these properties both affect the fluid density and diffuse at different rates. A variety of patterns can arise from these buoyancy-driven flows, including spatially localized states known as convectons, which consist of convective fluid motion localized within a background of quiescent fluid. We consider these states in a vertical slot with the horizontal temperature and solutal gradients providing competing effects to the fluid density while allowing the existence of a conduction state. In this configuration, convectons have been studied with specific parameter values where the onset of convection is subcritical, and the states have been found to lie on a pair of secondary branches that undergo homoclinic snaking in a parameter regime below the onset of linear instability. In this paper, we show that convectons persist into parameter regimes in which the primary bifurcation is supercritical and there is no bistability, despite coexistence between the stable conduction state and large-amplitude convection. We detail this transition by considering spatial dynamics and observe how the structure of the secondary branches becomes increasingly complex owing to the increased role of inertia at low Prandtl numbers.",

Precise conditions are provided for the existence and criticality of Turing bifurcations in a general class of activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion equations on a one-dimensional infinite domain. The class includes generalized Schnakenberg and Brusselator models, as well as other models with cubic autocatalytic nonlinear terms. Previous numerical work suggests the existence of a bifurcation structure containing localized patterns due to the so-called homoclinic snaking mechanism. This paper provides explicit calculations to justify those results. Two distinct scalings of parameters that lead to tractable normal-form coefficients are considered in the limit that the diffusion ratio [math]. First, under a small-parameter scaling, the Turing bifurcation is shown to be always subcritical. Second, a large-parameter scaling reveals the Turing bifurcation to be supercritical, leading, by continuity, to the existence of a codimension-two degenerate bifurcation. The sign of a fifth-order normal form coefficient is also computed, which is shown to have the correct sign for the local birth of homoclinic snaking. For the case of the Brusselator, two such codimension-two points can be found explicitly, as can the leading-order expression for the Maxwell point, in a parameter wedge about which localized patterns emerge. Numerical results are found to be consistent with the theory.",

A unified method for analyzing the dynamics and topological structure associated with a class of Floquet topological insulators is presented. The method is applied to a system that describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves through the bulk of a two-dimensional lattice that is helically driven in the direction of propagation. Tight-binding approximations are employed to derive reduced dynamical systems. Further asymptotic approximations, valid in the high-frequency driving regime, yield a time-averaged system which governs the leading order behavior of the wave. From this follows an analytic calculation of the Berry connection, curvature, and Chern number via analyzing the local behavior of the eigenfunctions near the critical points of the spectrum. Examples include honeycomb, Lieb, kagome, and 1/5-depleted lattices. In the nonlinear regime, novel equations governing slowly varying wave envelopes are derived. For the honeycomb lattice, numerical simulations show that for relatively small nonlinear effects a striking spiral pattern occurs; as nonlinearity increases, localized structures emerge, and for somewhat higher nonlinearity the waves appear to collapse.",

Classical gene expression models assume exponential switching time distributions between the active and inactive promoter states. However, recent experiments have shown that many genes in mammalian cells may produce nonexponential switching time distributions, implying the existence of multiple promoter states and molecular memory in the promoter switching dynamics. Here we analytically solve a gene expression model with random bursting and complex promoter switching, and derive the time-dependent distributions of the mRNA and protein copy numbers, generalizing the steady-state solution obtained in [T. Zhou and J. Zhang, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 72 (2012), pp. 789–818] and [U. Herbach, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 79 (2019), pp. 1007–1029]. Using multiscale simplification techniques, we find that molecular memory has no influence on the time-dependent distribution when promoter switching is very fast or very slow, while it significantly affects the distribution when promoter switching is neither too fast nor too slow. By analyzing the dynamical phase diagram of the system, we also find that molecular memory in the inactive gene state weakens transient and stationary bimodality of the copy number distribution, while molecular memory in the active gene state enhances such bimodality.",

When ions are crowded, the effect of steric repulsion between ions (which can produce oscillations in charge density profiles) becomes significant and the conventional Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) equation should be modified. Several modified PB equations were developed but the associated total ionic charge density has no oscillation. This motivates us to derive a general model of PB equations called the PB-steric equations with a parameter [math], which not only include the conventional and modified PB equations but also have oscillatory total ionic charge density under different assumptions of steric effects and chemical potentials. As [math], the PB-steric equation becomes the conventional PB equation, but as [math], the concentrations of ions and solvent molecules are determined by the Lambert type functions. To approach the modified PB equations, we study the asymptotic limit of PB-steric equations with the Robin boundary condition as [math] goes to infinity. Our theoretical results show that the PB-steric equations (for [math]) may include the conventional and modified PB equations. On the other hand, we use the PB-steric equations to find oscillatory total ionic charge density which cannot be obtained in the conventional and modified PB equations.",

Furthermore, we perform quantitative analyses for the eigenvalues and the slopes of two conical dispersion surfaces near each Dirac point based on a combination of the layer potential technique and asymptotic analysis.

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. Biological systems are known to be inherently uncertain and complex, and it is often difficult to justify rigorously functional forms used in a mathematical model. Generally, one chooses some simple function having qualitatively correct behavior without concern for the precise choice of function; the assumption has been that qualitatively similar functions will produce qualitatively similar behavior from the model. However, it has been shown that, in some cases, the qualitative predictions from a model are sensitive to the particular functional form used; this property is known as structural sensitivity. A promising tool for quantification of structural sensitivity is the use of partially specified models, in which some number of functions in equations are not defined explicitly. However, in this approach we cannot rely on the traditional parameter-based framework, where all functional forms are well defined but contain parameters to be determined. The main difficulties are that, mathematically, we need to deal with an infinite-dimensional function space and that a well-defined measure on that space is needed. We propose a novel framework to reveal the structural sensitivity and quantify uncertainty in partially specified biological models based on ordinary differential equations backed up by empirical data. Our method uses path integration, previously introduced in theoretical physics. As an insightful example, we explore structural sensitivity of a well-known tritrophic food chain model in which the functional response of the predator is uncertain, using available experimental data on protozoan predation on bacteria. For the mentioned model, we compare the novel framework with the classical methods of parameter-based sensitivity analysis and demonstrate distinct outcomes for the two approaches. Finally, we discuss a further extension of the proposed framework.",
