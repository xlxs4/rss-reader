          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we study stochastic regularized Newton methods to find zeros of nonlinear equations, whose exact function information is normally expensive to calculate but approximations can be easily accessed via calls to stochastic oracles. To handle the potential singularity of Jacobian approximations, we compute a regularized Newton step at each iteration. Then we take a unit step if it can be accepted by an inexact line search condition, and a preset step otherwise. We investigate the global convergence properties and the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm with high probability. We also propose a stochastic regularized Newton method incorporating a variance reduction technique and establishing the corresponding sample complexities in terms of total numbers of stochastic oracle calls to find an approximate solution. Finally, we report some numerical results and demonstrate the promising performances of the two proposed algorithms.",

          "description": "Abstract\nA high-order finite-volume scheme with anisotropic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is combined with a parallel inexact Newton method for the solution of steady compressible fluid flows governed by the Euler and Navier–Stokes equations on three-dimensional multi-block body-fitted hexahedral meshes. The proposed steady flow solution method combines a family of robust and accurate high-order central essentially non-oscillatory (CENO) spatial discretization schemes with both a scalable and efficient Newton–Krylov–Schwarz (NKS) algorithm and a block-based anisotropic AMR method. The CENO scheme is based on a hybrid solution reconstruction procedure that provides high-order accuracy in smooth regions (even for smooth extrema) and non-oscillatory transitions at discontinuities and makes use of a high-order representation of the mesh and a high-order treatment of boundary conditions. In the proposed Newton method, the resulting linear systems of equations are solved using the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) algorithm preconditioned by a domain-based additive Schwarz technique. The latter uses the domain decomposition provided by the block-based AMR scheme leading to a fully parallel implicit approach with an efficient scalability of the overall scheme. The anisotropic AMR method is based on a binary tree data structure and permits local anisotropic refinement of the grid in preferred directions as directed by appropriately specified physics-based refinement criteria. Numerical results are presented for a range of inviscid and viscous steady problems and the computational performance of the combined scheme is demonstrated and assessed.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this work we study various continuous finite element discretization for two dimensional hyperbolic partial differential equations, varying the polynomial space (Lagrangian on equispaced, Lagrangian on quadrature points (Cubature) and Bernstein), the stabilization techniques (streamline-upwind Petrov–Galerkin, continuous interior penalty, orthogonal subscale stabilization) and the time discretization (Runge–Kutta (RK), strong stability preserving RK and deferred correction). This is an extension of the one dimensional study by Michel et al. (J Sci Comput 89(2):31, 2021. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-021-01632-7), whose results do not hold in multi-dimensional frameworks. The study ranks these schemes based on efficiency (most of them are mass-matrix free), stability and dispersion error, providing the best CFL and stabilization coefficients. The challenges in two-dimensions are related to the Fourier analysis. Here, we perform it on two types of periodic triangular meshes varying the angle of the advection, and we combine all the results for a general stability analysis. Furthermore, we introduce additional high order viscosity to stabilize the discontinuities, in order to show how to use these methods for tests of practical interest. All the theoretical results are thoroughly validated numerically both on linear and non-linear problems, and error-CPU time curves are provided. Our final conclusions suggest that Cubature elements combined with SSPRK and OSS stabilization is the most promising combination.",

          "description": "Abstract\nTackling new machine learning problems with neural networks always means optimizing numerous hyperparameters that define their structure and strongly impact their performances. In this work, we study the use of goal-oriented sensitivity analysis, based on the Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC), for hyperparameter analysis and optimization. Hyperparameters live in spaces that are often complex and awkward. They can be of different natures (categorical, discrete, boolean, continuous), interact, and have inter-dependencies. All this makes it non-trivial to perform classical sensitivity analysis. We alleviate these difficulties to obtain a robust analysis index that is able to quantify hyperparameters’ relative impact on a neural network’s final error. This valuable tool allows us to better understand hyperparameters and to make hyperparameter optimization more interpretable. We illustrate the benefits of this knowledge in the context of hyperparameter optimization and derive an HSIC-based optimization algorithm that we apply on MNIST and Cifar, classical machine learning data sets, but also on the approximation of Runge function and Bateman equations solution, of interest for scientific machine learning. This method yields neural networks that are both competitive and cost-effective.",

We first reduce the problem in an exterior domain to a bounded domain using the exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. Next, we formulate the reduced problem into an equivalent problem in an annulus by using a fictitious domain approach. Then, we apply the Fourier-spectral method in the radial direction to reduce the problem in an annulus to a sequence of 1-D Bessel-type equations, each with a one-sided open boundary condition that are to be determined by the boundary condition of the original Helmholtz equation. We solve these 1-D Bessel-type equations by the Legendre-spectral method, and determine the open boundary conditions with a least square approach. We derive a wave number explicit error estimate for the special case of a circular obstacle, and provide ample numerical results to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The goal of this work is to introduce a new online data driven modeling solution for tracking the dynamics of systems, the behavior of which is governed by (nonlinear) partial differential equations (PDEs). In order to reach this goal, this paper introduces a recursive algorithm for black box time varying model identification along with an online algorithm for reducing the order of the identified model. The resulting system model is a linear time varying low order state space representation usable, e.g., for controller design or prediction. The model reduction step relies on the recursive determination of the orthonormal basis of a specific data based proper orthogonal decomposition. The system identification procedure is initialized with the dynamic mode decomposition with control and updated recursively via the introduction of a specific recursive least squares algorithm. In both steps, a forgetting factor is used to focus on the most recent variations of the system. As case studies, a linear heat diffusion equation with a time varying diffusion parameter is first considered. The Burgers equation, a nonlinear hyperbolic PDE, is then utilized to assess the introduced methods applicability with nonlinear systems. Identification results based on simulation show the high accuracy of this new approach.",

This paper presents a framework to perform bifurcation analysis in laboratory experiments or simulations. We employ control-based continuation to study the dynamics of a macroscopic variable of a microscopically defined model, exploring the potential viability of the underlying feedback control techniques in an experiment. In contrast to previous experimental studies that used iterative root-finding methods on the feedback control targets, we propose a feedback control law that is inherently noninvasive. That is, the control discovers the location of equilibria and stabilizes them simultaneously. We call the proposed control zero-in-equilibrium feedback control and we prove that it is able to stabilize branches of equilibria, except at singularities of codimension [math], where [math] is the number of state space dimensions the feedback can depend on. We apply the method to a simulated evacuation scenario where pedestrians have to reach an exit after maneuvering left or right around an obstacle. The scenario shows a hysteresis phenomenon with bistability and tipping between two possible steady pedestrian flows in microscopic simulations. We demonstrate for the evacuation scenario that the proposed control law is able to uniformly discover and stabilize steady flows along the entire branch, including points where other noninvasive approaches to feedback control become singular.",

We study the paraxial wave equation with a randomly perturbed index of refraction, which can model the propagation of a wave beam in a turbulent medium. The random perturbation is a stationary and isotropic process with a general form of the covariance that may or may not be integrable. We focus attention mostly on the nonintegrable case, which corresponds to a random perturbation with long-range correlations, that is, relevant for propagation through a cloudy turbulent atmosphere. The analysis is carried out in a high-frequency regime where the forward scattering approximation holds. It reveals that the randomization of the wave field is multiscale: The travel time of the wave front is randomized at short distances of propagation, and it can be described by a fractional Brownian motion. The wave field observed in the random travel time frame is affected by the random perturbations at long distances, and it is described by a Schrödinger-type equation driven by a standard Brownian field. We use these results to quantify how scattering leads to decorrelation of the spatial and spectral components of the wave field and to a deformation of the pulse emitted by the source. These are important questions for applications, such as imaging and free space communications with pulsed laser beams through a turbulent atmosphere. We also compare the results with those used in the optics literature, which are based on the Kolmogorov model of turbulence. We show explicitly that the commonly used approximations for the decorrelation of spatial and spectral components are appropriate for the Kolmogorov model but fail for models with long-range correlations.",

Traveling waves propagating on a taut cable resting on an elastic substrate are investigated by an equivalent mechanical model based on the classical Klein–Gordon equation. The formulation is devised for an elastic response of generally arbitrary shape, and permits one to compute the propagation wave velocity without solving the equation of motion, thus providing a unified theoretical framework for a large class of response functions, linear or nonlinear, smooth or nonsmooth. The general solution is then applied to the cases of a general polynomial substrate, a bilinear substrate, a bilinear substrate with a cubic correction, and a negative linear stiffness substrate, all of them falling within the realm of nonsmooth systems when a piecewise continuous stiffness is chosen; in the second one, we recover results present in the literature and obtained by employing a method based on matching conditions, which are spared in the approach used in this paper.

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 52, Issue 1, Page 1-37, February 2023. \n Abstract. We propose a new algorithm for Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problems (PCSPs). It is a combination of the Constraint Basic LP relaxation and the Affine IP relaxation (CLAP). We give a characterization of the power of CLAP in terms of a minion homomorphism. Using this characterization, we identify a certain weak notion of symmetry which, if satisfied by infinitely many polymorphisms of PCSPs, guarantees tractability. We demonstrate that there are PCSPs solved by CLAP that are not solved by any of the existing algorithms for PCSPs; in particular, not by the [math] algorithm of Brakensiek et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 49 (2020), pp. 1232--1248] and not by a reduction to tractable finite-domain CSPs.",
