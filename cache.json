          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose and analyze an efficient implicit–explicit second-order backward differentiation formulation (BDF2) scheme with variable time steps for gradient flow problems using a scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach. Comparing with the traditional second-order SAV approach (Shen et al. in J Comput Phys 353:407–416, 2018), we only use a first-order method to approximate the auxiliary variable. This treatment does not affect the second-order accuracy of the unknown function \n                      \n                      \\(\\phi \\)\n                      \n                    , and is essentially important for deriving the unconditional energy stability of the proposed BDF2 scheme with variable time steps. We prove the unconditional energy stability of the scheme for a modified discrete energy with the adjacent time step ratio \n                      \n                      \\(\\gamma _{n+1}:=\\tau _{n+1}/\\tau _{n}\\le 4.8645\\)\n                      \n                    .

Based on this uniform bound of the numerical solution, a rigorous error estimate of the proposed scheme is carried out on the nonuniform temporal mesh. Finally, serval numerical tests are provided to validate the theoretical claims. With the application of an adaptive time-stepping strategy, the efficiency of our proposed scheme can be clearly observed in the coarsening dynamics simulation.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this work the development of a machine learning-based Reduced Order Model (ROM) for the investigation of hemodynamics in a patient-specific configuration of Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) is proposed. The computational domain is referred to left branches of coronary arteries when a stenosis of the Left Main Coronary Artery (LMCA) occurs. The method extracts a reduced basis space from a collection of high-fidelity solutions via a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) algorithm and employs Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for the computation of the modal coefficients. The Full Order Model (FOM) is represented by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations discretized using a Finite Volume (FV) technique. Both physical and geometrical parametrization are taken into account, the former one related to the inlet flow rate and the latter one related to the stenosis severity. With respect to the previous works focused on the development of a ROM framework for the evaluation of coronary artery disease, the novelties of our study include the use of the FV method in a patient-specific configuration, the use of a data-driven ROM technique and the mesh deformation strategy based on a Free Form Deformation (FFD) technique. The performance of our ROM approach is analyzed in terms of the error between full order and reduced order solutions as well as the speed-up achieved at the online stage.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe propose a new approach to generate a reliable reduced model for a parametric elliptic problem, in the presence of noisy data. The reference model reduction procedure is the directional HiPOD method, which combines Hierarchical Model reduction with a standard Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, according to an offline/online paradigm. In this paper we show that directional HiPOD looses in terms of accuracy when problem data are affected by noise. This is due to the interpolation driving the online phase, since it replicates, by definition, the noise trend. To overcome this limit, we replace interpolation with Machine Learning fitting models which better discriminate relevant physical features in the data from irrelevant unstructured noise. The numerical assessment, although preliminary, confirms the potentialities of the new approach.",

The main idea of the scheme is first to introduce an quadratic auxiliary variable to transform the Hamiltonian energy into a modified quadratic energy and the original system is then reformulated into an equivalent system which satisfies the mass, modified energy as well as two linear invariants. The symplectic Runge-Kutta method in time, together with the Fourier pseudo-spectral method in space is employed to compute the solution of the reformulated system. The main benefit of the proposed schemes is that it can achieve arbitrarily high-order accurate in time and conserve the three invariants: mass, Hamiltonian energy and two linear invariants. In addition, an efficient fixed-point iteration is proposed to solve the resulting nonlinear equations of the proposed schemes.

          "description": "Abstract\nMembrane problems commonly encountered in engineering and biological applications involve large deformations and complex configurations. Immersed boundary (IB) method, formulated by the fluid equations in which the fluid-structure interaction is described in terms of the Dirac function, is one of the most powerful tools to simulate such problems. However, the IB method suffers from severe time step restrictions to maintain stability if the discretization lacks conservation of energy, especially for two-phase flows. In this paper, we develop an energy stable IB method for solving deformable membrane problems with non-uniform density and viscosity. Unlike the classic IB formulation, the evolution of membrane, including elastic tension and bending force, is controlled by its tangent angle and arc length. After minor modifications, it is shown that the model satisfies the continuous energy law. Thus, for the reformulated model, we proposed an implicit unconditionally energy stable scheme, where the energy of the scheme is proved to be dissipative. The resultant system is solved iteratively and the numerical results show that the proposed scheme is energy stable and capable of predicting the dynamics of extensible and inextensible interface problems with non-uniform density and viscosity.",

In this first part, we will introduce a simple interpolation method named Spherical Interpolation of orDER n (SIDER-n) that gives a \n                      \n                      \\(C^{n}\\)\n                      \n                     interpolant given \n                      \n                      \\(n \\ge 2\\)\n                      \n                    . The idea generalizes the construction of the Bézier curves developed for \n                      \n                      \\(\\mathbb {R}\\)\n                      \n                    . The second part incorporates the ENO philosophy and develops a new Spherical Essentially Non-Oscillatory (SENO) interpolation method. When the underlying curve on \n                      \n                      \\(\\mathbb {S}^2\\)\n                      \n                     has kinks or sharp discontinuity in the higher derivatives, our proposed approach can reduce spurious oscillations in the high-order reconstruction. We will give multiple examples to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper develops a new coupled enriched Galerkin (EG) scheme for Biot’s poroelasticity model based on the displacement-pressure formulation. The aim of this work is to provide a stable and robust numerical method for a wide range of physical and numerical parameters. The finite-dimensional solution spaces are enriched linear Lagrange spaces, and the inf-sup condition between the two spaces is achieved by adding a stabilization term. The resulting coupled EG method is locally conservative and provides stable solutions without spurious oscillations or overshoots/undershoots. The well-posedness and optimal a priori error estimates are established. Numerical results in various scenarios are provided.",

          "description": "Abstract\nOur recent work (Kang and Wang in J Sci Comput 82:1–33, 2020) performed a complete asymptotic analysis and proposed a modified Filon-type method for a class of oscillatory infinite Bessel transform with a general oscillator. In this paper, we present and analyze a different method by converting the integration path to the complex plane for this class of oscillatory infinite Bessel transform. In particular, we establish a series of new quadrature rules for this transform and carry out rigorous analysis, including the cases that the oscillator g(x) has either zeros or stationary points. The error analysis shows the advantages that this approach exhibits high asymptotic order, and the accuracy improves significantly as either the frequency \n                      \n                      \\(\\omega \\)\n                      \n                     or the number of nodes n increases. Furthermore, the constructed method shows higher accuracy and error order by comparing with the existing modified Filon-type method in our recent work (Kang and Wang 2020) at the same computational cost. Some numerical experiments are provided to verify the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe propose a novel use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) (i) to make predictions in time (PredGAN) and (ii) to assimilate measurements (DA-PredGAN). In the latter case, we take advantage of the natural adjoint-like properties of generative models and the ability to simulate forwards and backwards in time. GANs have received much attention recently, after achieving excellent results for their generation of realistic-looking images. We wish to explore how this property translates to new applications in computational modelling and to exploit the adjoint-like properties for efficient data assimilation. We apply these methods to a compartmental model in epidemiology that is able to model space and time variations, and that mimics the spread of COVID-19 in an idealised town. To do this, the GAN is set within a reduced-order model, which uses a low-dimensional space for the spatial distribution of the simulation states. Then the GAN learns the evolution of the low-dimensional states over time. The results show that the proposed methods can accurately predict the evolution of the high-fidelity numerical simulation, and can efficiently assimilate observed data and determine the corresponding model parameters.",
