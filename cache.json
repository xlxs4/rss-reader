          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper addresses a simple energy-based overset finite element method (EbO-FEM) to solve pseudo-static deformation problems consisting of overlapped meshes based on the domain composition method (DCM). This scheme is a non-iterative equation-based method for enforcing the continuity of the displacement field. Hence, the scheme consumes possible minimal computational costs for deformation problems with non-conforming overlapping meshes. The system’s total energy is augmented with continuity constraint energy (CCE) which is a function of the gaps in the displacement field between two overlapping regions. Subsequently, two conventional integration schemes, the Gauss-point projection, and the point-to-point projection, are utilized to discretize the CCE. It is confirmed that both schemes can yield accurate and unique solutions in the overlapped region of the finite element meshes. Further, we proposed a dimensionless relative penalty parameter (DRP). We found that DRP ranging between 1 to 10 is appropriate to robustly obtain accurate solutions for a wide range of scales, stiffness, and geometries, which is supported by three numerical simulations without increasing computational costs after assembling the global matrices and vectors.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe present the first implementation of the Active Flux method on adaptively refined Cartesian grids. The Active Flux method is a third order accurate finite volume method for hyperbolic conservation laws, which is based on the use of point values as well as cell average values of the conserved quantities. The resulting method has a compact stencil in space and time and good stability properties. The method is implemented as a new solver in ForestClaw, a software for parallel adaptive mesh refinement of patch-based solvers. On each Cartesian grid patch the single grid Active Flux method can be applied. The exchange of data between grid patches is organised via ghost cells. The local stencil in space and time and the availability of the point values that are used for the reconstruction, leads to an efficient implementation. The resulting method is third order accurate, conservative and allows the use of subcycling in time.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we study stochastic regularized Newton methods to find zeros of nonlinear equations, whose exact function information is normally expensive to calculate but approximations can be easily accessed via calls to stochastic oracles. To handle the potential singularity of Jacobian approximations, we compute a regularized Newton step at each iteration. Then we take a unit step if it can be accepted by an inexact line search condition, and a preset step otherwise. We investigate the global convergence properties and the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm with high probability. We also propose a stochastic regularized Newton method incorporating a variance reduction technique and establishing the corresponding sample complexities in terms of total numbers of stochastic oracle calls to find an approximate solution. Finally, we report some numerical results and demonstrate the promising performances of the two proposed algorithms.",

          "description": "Abstract\nA high-order finite-volume scheme with anisotropic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is combined with a parallel inexact Newton method for the solution of steady compressible fluid flows governed by the Euler and Navier–Stokes equations on three-dimensional multi-block body-fitted hexahedral meshes. The proposed steady flow solution method combines a family of robust and accurate high-order central essentially non-oscillatory (CENO) spatial discretization schemes with both a scalable and efficient Newton–Krylov–Schwarz (NKS) algorithm and a block-based anisotropic AMR method. The CENO scheme is based on a hybrid solution reconstruction procedure that provides high-order accuracy in smooth regions (even for smooth extrema) and non-oscillatory transitions at discontinuities and makes use of a high-order representation of the mesh and a high-order treatment of boundary conditions. In the proposed Newton method, the resulting linear systems of equations are solved using the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) algorithm preconditioned by a domain-based additive Schwarz technique. The latter uses the domain decomposition provided by the block-based AMR scheme leading to a fully parallel implicit approach with an efficient scalability of the overall scheme. The anisotropic AMR method is based on a binary tree data structure and permits local anisotropic refinement of the grid in preferred directions as directed by appropriately specified physics-based refinement criteria. Numerical results are presented for a range of inviscid and viscous steady problems and the computational performance of the combined scheme is demonstrated and assessed.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this work we study various continuous finite element discretization for two dimensional hyperbolic partial differential equations, varying the polynomial space (Lagrangian on equispaced, Lagrangian on quadrature points (Cubature) and Bernstein), the stabilization techniques (streamline-upwind Petrov–Galerkin, continuous interior penalty, orthogonal subscale stabilization) and the time discretization (Runge–Kutta (RK), strong stability preserving RK and deferred correction). This is an extension of the one dimensional study by Michel et al. (J Sci Comput 89(2):31, 2021. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-021-01632-7), whose results do not hold in multi-dimensional frameworks. The study ranks these schemes based on efficiency (most of them are mass-matrix free), stability and dispersion error, providing the best CFL and stabilization coefficients. The challenges in two-dimensions are related to the Fourier analysis. Here, we perform it on two types of periodic triangular meshes varying the angle of the advection, and we combine all the results for a general stability analysis. Furthermore, we introduce additional high order viscosity to stabilize the discontinuities, in order to show how to use these methods for tests of practical interest. All the theoretical results are thoroughly validated numerically both on linear and non-linear problems, and error-CPU time curves are provided. Our final conclusions suggest that Cubature elements combined with SSPRK and OSS stabilization is the most promising combination.",

The approximation of continuity equation is obtained by a piecewise constant discontinuous Galerkin method. The discretization of momentum equation is obtained by conforming Bernardi–Raugel finite elements. The convergence of mixed DG-FEM for nonlinear, isentropic stokes problem is rigorously established by compactness arguments and the existence analysis of Lions on the discrete level. Employing the continuous relative energy functional method and a detailed consistency analysis, we derive two error estimates for the numerical solution of the semi-stationary isentropic stokes system.

We present a data-driven point of view for rare events, which represent conformational transitions in biochemical reactions modeled by overdamped Langevin dynamics on manifolds in high dimensions. We first reinterpret the transition state theory and the transition path theory from the optimal control viewpoint. Given a point cloud probing the manifold, we construct a discrete Markov chain with a [math]-matrix computed from an approximated Voronoi tesselation via the point cloud. We use this [math]-matrix to compute a discrete committor function whose level set automatically orders the point cloud. Then based on the committor function, an optimally controlled random walk on point clouds is constructed and utilized to efficiently sample transition paths, which become an almost sure event in [math] time instead of a rare event in the original reaction dynamics. To compute the mean transition path efficiently, a local averaging algorithm based on the optimally controlled random walk is developed, which adapts the finite temperature string method to the controlled Monte Carlo samples. Numerical examples on sphere/torus including a conformational transition for the alanine dipeptide in vacuum are conducted to illustrate the data-driven solver for the transition path theory on point clouds. The mean transition path obtained via the controlled Monte Carlo simulations highly coincides with the computed dominant transition path in the transition path theory.",

The goal of this work is to introduce a new online data driven modeling solution for tracking the dynamics of systems, the behavior of which is governed by (nonlinear) partial differential equations (PDEs). In order to reach this goal, this paper introduces a recursive algorithm for black box time varying model identification along with an online algorithm for reducing the order of the identified model. The resulting system model is a linear time varying low order state space representation usable, e.g., for controller design or prediction. The model reduction step relies on the recursive determination of the orthonormal basis of a specific data based proper orthogonal decomposition. The system identification procedure is initialized with the dynamic mode decomposition with control and updated recursively via the introduction of a specific recursive least squares algorithm. In both steps, a forgetting factor is used to focus on the most recent variations of the system. As case studies, a linear heat diffusion equation with a time varying diffusion parameter is first considered. The Burgers equation, a nonlinear hyperbolic PDE, is then utilized to assess the introduced methods applicability with nonlinear systems. Identification results based on simulation show the high accuracy of this new approach.",

This paper presents a framework to perform bifurcation analysis in laboratory experiments or simulations. We employ control-based continuation to study the dynamics of a macroscopic variable of a microscopically defined model, exploring the potential viability of the underlying feedback control techniques in an experiment. In contrast to previous experimental studies that used iterative root-finding methods on the feedback control targets, we propose a feedback control law that is inherently noninvasive. That is, the control discovers the location of equilibria and stabilizes them simultaneously. We call the proposed control zero-in-equilibrium feedback control and we prove that it is able to stabilize branches of equilibria, except at singularities of codimension [math], where [math] is the number of state space dimensions the feedback can depend on. We apply the method to a simulated evacuation scenario where pedestrians have to reach an exit after maneuvering left or right around an obstacle. The scenario shows a hysteresis phenomenon with bistability and tipping between two possible steady pedestrian flows in microscopic simulations. We demonstrate for the evacuation scenario that the proposed control law is able to uniformly discover and stabilize steady flows along the entire branch, including points where other noninvasive approaches to feedback control become singular.",

The analysis is carried out in a high-frequency regime where the forward scattering approximation holds. It reveals that the randomization of the wave field is multiscale: The travel time of the wave front is randomized at short distances of propagation, and it can be described by a fractional Brownian motion. The wave field observed in the random travel time frame is affected by the random perturbations at long distances, and it is described by a Schrödinger-type equation driven by a standard Brownian field. We use these results to quantify how scattering leads to decorrelation of the spatial and spectral components of the wave field and to a deformation of the pulse emitted by the source. These are important questions for applications, such as imaging and free space communications with pulsed laser beams through a turbulent atmosphere. We also compare the results with those used in the optics literature, which are based on the Kolmogorov model of turbulence. We show explicitly that the commonly used approximations for the decorrelation of spatial and spectral components are appropriate for the Kolmogorov model but fail for models with long-range correlations.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Volume 83, Issue 1, Page 1-24, February 2023. \n Abstract. Traveling waves propagating on a taut cable resting on an elastic substrate are investigated by an equivalent mechanical model based on the classical Klein–Gordon equation. The formulation is devised for an elastic response of generally arbitrary shape, and permits one to compute the propagation wave velocity without solving the equation of motion, thus providing a unified theoretical framework for a large class of response functions, linear or nonlinear, smooth or nonsmooth. The general solution is then applied to the cases of a general polynomial substrate, a bilinear substrate, a bilinear substrate with a cubic correction, and a negative linear stiffness substrate, all of them falling within the realm of nonsmooth systems when a piecewise continuous stiffness is chosen; in the second one, we recover results present in the literature and obtained by employing a method based on matching conditions, which are spared in the approach used in this paper. Finally, the application to the sine-Gordon equation is considered.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 52, Issue 1, Page 1-37, February 2023. \n Abstract. We propose a new algorithm for Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problems (PCSPs). It is a combination of the Constraint Basic LP relaxation and the Affine IP relaxation (CLAP). We give a characterization of the power of CLAP in terms of a minion homomorphism. Using this characterization, we identify a certain weak notion of symmetry which, if satisfied by infinitely many polymorphisms of PCSPs, guarantees tractability. We demonstrate that there are PCSPs solved by CLAP that are not solved by any of the existing algorithms for PCSPs; in particular, not by the [math] algorithm of Brakensiek et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 49 (2020), pp. 1232--1248] and not by a reduction to tractable finite-domain CSPs.",
