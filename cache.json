          "description": "Abstract\nAll the existing entropy stable (ES) schemes for relativistic hydrodynamics (RHD) in the literature were restricted to the ideal equation of state (EOS), which however is often a poor approximation for most relativistic flows due to its inconsistency with the relativistic kinetic theory. This paper develops high-order ES finite difference schemes for RHD with general Synge-type EOS, which encompasses a range of special EOSs. We first establish an entropy pair for the RHD equations with general Synge-type EOS in any space dimensions. We rigorously prove that the found entropy function is strictly convex and derive the associated entropy variables, laying the foundation for designing entropy conservative (EC) and ES schemes. Due to relativistic effects, one cannot explicitly express primitive variables, fluxes, and entropy variables in terms of conservative variables. Consequently, this highly complicates the analysis of the entropy structure of the RHD equations, the investigation of entropy convexity, and the construction of EC numerical fluxes. By using a suitable set of parameter variables, we construct novel two-point EC fluxes in a unified form for general Synge-type EOS. We obtain high-order EC schemes through linear combinations of the two-point EC fluxes. Arbitrarily high-order accurate ES schemes are achieved by incorporating dissipation terms into the EC schemes, based on (weighted) essentially non-oscillatory reconstructions. Additionally, we derive the general dissipation matrix for general Synge-type EOS based on the scaled eigenvectors of the RHD system. We also define a suitable average of the dissipation matrix at the cell interfaces to ensure that the resulting ES schemes can resolve stationary contact discontinuities accurately. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our schemes for RHD with four special EOSs.",

Based on an operator splitting, the scattering problem is recast into a coupled boundary value problem for the Helmholtz and modified Helmholtz equations. A novel boundary integral formulation is proposed for the coupled problem. By introducing an appropriate regularizer, the well-posedness is established for the system of boundary integral equations. Moreover, the convergence analysis is carried out for the semi- and full-discrete schemes of the boundary integral system by using the collocation method. Numerical results show that the proposed method is highly accurate for both smooth and nonsmooth examples.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe describe novel numerical methods for solving a class of high-order time-dependent PDEs on general geometries, which involve second-order derivatives in time and up-to fourth-order derivatives in space. This type of PDEs are widely used in applications such as the Boussinesq equation and in modeling thin-walled elastic structures such as beams, plates and shells, etc. High-order spatial derivatives together with general geometries bring a number of challenges for many numerical methods. In this paper, we resolve these challenges by discretizing the spatial derivatives in domains with general geometries using the composite overlapping grid method. The discretization on overlapping grids requires numerical interpolations to couple solutions on different component grids. However, the presence of interpolation equations breaks the symmetry of the overall spatial discretization, causing numerical instability in time-stepping schemes. To address this, a fourth-order hyper-dissipation term is included for stabilization. Investigation of incorporating the hyper-dissipation term into several time-stepping schemes for solving the semi-discrete system leads to the development of a series of algorithms. Accurate and stable numerical boundary conditions for Dirichlet and Neumann type boundaries are also developed for general geometries. Quadratic eigenvalue problems for a simplified model problem on 1D overlapping grids are considered to reveal the weak instability caused by interpolation between component grids. This model problem is also investigated for the stabilization effects of the proposed algorithms. Carefully designed numerical experiments and two benchmark problems concerning the Kirchhoff–Love plate model are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our approaches. This work shows that finite difference methods on overlapping grids are well-suited for solving high-order PDEs in complex domains for realistic applications.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe HLLC approximate Riemann solver improves upon the HLL Riemann solver by resolving contact discontinuities. This is a particularly desirable property for multi-material codes in which problems usually contain material interfaces. However, the HLLC solver is known to suffer from the carbuncle phenomenon, a numerical instability most apparent at grid-aligned shocks in multi-dimensional simulations. Many problems of interest, including high energy-density physics applications, require the accurate resolution of both material interfaces and hydrodynamic shocks. A variety of methods have been developed to cure this instability, with varying degrees of complexity. The objective of this work is to describe a simple approach to modify the HLLC Riemann solver and prevent the carbuncle instability. The method is then demonstrated for assorted two-dimensional test problems known to exhibit the shock instability. The performance of the new solver is compared with that of the standard HLL and HLLC Riemann solvers.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe present a family of novel explicit numerical methods for the diffusion or heat equation with Fisher, Huxley and Nagumo-type reaction terms. After discretizing the space variables as in conventional method of lines, our methods do not apply a finite difference approximation for the time derivatives, they instead combine constant- linear- and quadratic-neighbour approximations, which decouple the ordinary differential equations. In the obtained methods, the time step size appears in exponential form in the final expression with negative coefficients. In the case of the pure heat equation, the new values of the variable are convex combinations of the old values, which guarantees unconditional positivity and stability. We analytically prove that the convergence of the methods is fourth order in the time step size for linear ODE systems. We also prove that the concentration values in the case of Fisher’s and Nagumo’s equations lie within the unit interval regardless of the time step size. We construct an adaptive time step size time integrator with an extremely cheap embedded error control method. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that the proposed methods work for nonlinear equations in stiff cases as well. According to the comparisons with other solvers, the new methods can have a significant advantage.",

Retinex-based methods which decompose the images into reflectance and illumination components have been actively studied over the past years. In this paper, we propose a Retinex-based method with dual reflectance estimation. To be precise, we start with a simple reflectance estimation based on the HSV color space, which is then accompanied by another variational-based estimation of both the reflectance and illumination. Finally, we bring a new perspective to the Retinex model by reconstructing the normal-light image with a novel transformation map given by the estimated reflectance and illumination, which we call radiance mapping. Extensive experiments show that our method obtains outstanding results, both numerically and visually, compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe propose a second-order accurate semi-implicit and well-balanced finite volume scheme for the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics including gravitational source terms. The scheme treats all terms associated with the acoustic pressure implicitly while keeping the remaining terms part of the explicit sub-system. This semi-implicit approach makes the method particularly well suited for problems in the low Mach regime. We combine the semi-implicit scheme with the deviation well-balancing technique and prove that it maintains equilibrium solutions for the magnetohydrostatic case up to rounding errors. In order to preserve the divergence-free property of the magnetic field enforced by the solenoidal constraint, we incorporate a constrained transport method in the semi-implicit framework. Second order of accuracy is achieved by means of a standard spatial reconstruction technique with total variation diminishing property, and by an asymptotic preserving time stepping algorithm built upon the implicit-explicit Runge–Kutta time integrators. Numerical tests in the low Mach regime and near magnetohydrostatic equilibria support the low Mach and well-balanced properties of the numerical method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nExponential integrators have been applied successfully in several physics-related differential equations. However, their application in hyperbolic systems with absorbing boundaries, like the ones arising in seismic imaging, still lacks theoretical and experimental investigations. The present work conducts an in-depth study of exponential integration using Faber polynomials, consisting of a generalization of a well-known exponential method that uses Chebyshev polynomials. This allows solving non-symmetric operators that emerge from classic seismic wave propagation problems with absorbing boundaries. Theoretical as well as numerical results are presented for Faber approximations. One of the theoretical contributions is the proposal of a sharp bound for the approximation error of the exponential of a normal matrix. We also show the practical importance of determining an optimal ellipse encompassing the full spectrum of the discrete operator to ensure and enhance the convergence of the Faber exponential series. Furthermore, based on estimates of the spectrum of the discrete operator of the wave equations with a widely used absorbing boundary method, we numerically investigate the stability, dispersion, convergence, and computational efficiency of the Faber exponential scheme. Overall, we conclude that the method is suitable for seismic wave problems and can provide accurate results with large time step sizes, with computational efficiency increasing with the increase of the approximation degree.",

The virtual element method is a recent numerical technology that generalizes finite elements by considering polytopal computational grids, thus allowing more flexibility and accuracy in approximating complex computational domains. This can be an advantage when modeling for instance damaged cardiac tissues or structural heterogeneities. A previous similar study was performed in Anaya et al.

The proposed method has essential applications in Kohn–Sham density functional theory and relies on an extrapolation scheme and the least squares method. Moreover, the proposed solution is easy to implement and can accelerate the convergence of self-consistent field iteration. The main idea is to fit out a polynomial based on the errors of the derived approximate solutions and then extrapolate the errors into zero to obtain a new approximation. The developed scheme can be applied not only to the Kohn–Sham density functional theory but also to accelerate the self-consistent field iterations of other nonlinear equations. Some numerical results for the Kohn–Sham equation and general nonlinear equations are presented to validate the efficiency of the new method.",

Stochastic systems often exhibit multiple viable metastable states that are long-lived. Over very long timescales, fluctuations may push the system to transition between them, drastically changing its macroscopic configuration. In realistic systems, these transitions can happen via multiple physical mechanisms, corresponding to multiple distinct transition channels for a pair of states. In this paper, we use the fact that the transition path ensemble is equivalent to the invariant measure of a gradient flow in pathspace, which can be efficiently sampled via metadynamics. We demonstrate how this pathspace metadynamics, previously restricted to reversible molecular dynamics, is in fact very generally applicable to metastable stochastic systems, including irreversible and time-dependent ones, and allows rigorous estimation of the relative probability of competing transition paths. We showcase this approach on the study of a stochastic partial differential equation describing magnetic field reversal in the presence of advection.",

We provide a rigorous probabilistic framework for describing solutions to this system using that it has the form of a Kolmogorov equation for some Markov process. We then prove statistical stability of the smoothed Wigner transform under the Gaussian approximation.

Two competing types of interactions often play an important part in shaping system behavior, such as activatory and inhibitory functions in biological systems. Hence, signed networks, where each connection can be either positive or negative, have become popular models over recent years. However, the primary focus of the literature is on the unweighted and structurally balanced ones, where all cycles have an even number of negative edges. Hence here, we first introduce a classification of signed networks into balanced, antibalanced, or strictly unbalanced ones, and then characterize each type of signed networks in terms of the spectral properties of the signed weighted adjacency matrix. In particular, we show that the spectral radius of the matrix with signs is smaller than that without if and only if the signed network is strictly unbalanced. These properties are important to understand the dynamics on signed networks, both linear and nonlinear ones. Specifically, we find consistent patterns in a linear and a nonlinear dynamics theoretically, depending on their type of balance. We also propose two measures to further characterize strictly unbalanced networks, motivated by perturbation theory. Finally, we numerically verify these properties through experiments on both synthetic and real networks.",

This paper presents a methodology for the computation of whole sets of heteroclinic connections between isoenergetic slices of center manifolds of center [math] center [math] saddle fixed points of autonomous Hamiltonian systems. It involves (a) computing Taylor expansions of the center-unstable and center-stable manifolds of the departing and arriving fixed points through the parameterization method, using a new style that uncouples the center part from the hyperbolic one, thus making the fibered structure of the manifolds explicit; (b) uniformly meshing isoenergetic slices of the center manifolds, using a novel strategy that avoids numerical integration of the reduced differential equations and makes an explicit three-dimensional representation of these slices as deformed solid ellipsoids; (c) matching the center-stable and center-unstable manifolds of the departing and arriving points in a Poincaré section. The methodology is applied to obtain the whole set of isoenergetic heteroclinic connections from the center manifold of [math] to the center manifold of [math] in the Earth-Moon circular, spatial restricted three-body problem, for nine increasing energy levels that reach the appearance of halo orbits in both [math] and [math].

Connection matrices are a generalization of Morse boundary operators from the classical Morse theory for gradient vector fields. Developing an efficient computational framework for connection matrices is particularly important in the context of a rapidly growing data science that requires new mathematical tools for discrete data. Toward this goal, the classical theory for connection matrices has been adapted to combinatorial frameworks that facilitate computation. We develop an efficient persistence-like algorithm to compute a connection matrix from a given combinatorial (multi) vector field on a simplicial complex. This algorithm requires a single pass, improving upon a known algorithm that runs an implicit recursion executing two passes at each level. Overall, the new algorithm is more simple, direct, and efficient than the state-of-the-art. Because of the algorithm’s similarity to the persistence algorithm, one may take advantage of various software optimizations from topological data analysis.",

Contact defects are time-periodic patterns in one space dimension that resemble spatially homogeneous oscillations with a defect embedded in their core region. For theoretical and numerical purposes, it is important to understand whether these defects persist when the domain is truncated to large spatial intervals, supplemented by appropriate boundary conditions.

Repulsion between individuals within a finite radius is encountered in numerous applications, including cell exclusion, i.e., avoidance of overlapping cells, bird flocks, or microscopic pedestrian models. We define such individual-based particle dynamics in one spatial dimension with minimal assumptions of the repulsion force [math] as well as their external velocity [math] and prove their characteristic properties. Moreover, we are able to perform a rigorous limit from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale, where we could recover the finite interaction radius as a density threshold. Specific choices for the repulsion force [math] lead to well-known nonlinear diffusion equations on the macroscopic scale, as, e.g., the porous medium equation. At both scaling levels, numerical simulations are presented and compared to underline the analytical results.",

We analyze the well-posedness of certain field-only boundary integral equations (BIEs) for frequency domain electromagnetic scattering from perfectly conducting spheres. Starting from the observations that (1) the three components of the scattered electric field [math] and (2) scalar quantity [math] are radiative solutions of the Helmholtz equation, we see that novel boundary integral equation formulations of electromagnetic scattering from perfectly conducting obstacles can be derived using Green’s identities applied to the aforementioned quantities and the boundary conditions on the surface of the scatterer. The unknowns of these formulations are the normal derivatives of the three components of the scattered electric field and the normal component of the scattered electric field on the surface of the scatterer, and thus these formulations are referred to as field-only BIEs. In this paper we use the combined field methodology of Burton and Miller within the field-only BIE approach, and we derive new boundary integral formulations that feature only Helmholtz boundary integral operators, which we subsequently show to be well posed for all positive frequencies in the case of spherical scatterers. Relying on the spectral properties of Helmholtz boundary integral operators in spherical geometries, we show that the combined field-only boundary integral operators are diagonalizable in the case of spherical geometries and their eigenvalues are nonzero for all frequencies. Furthermore, we show that for spherical geometries one of the field-only integral formulations considered in this paper exhibits eigenvalues clustering at one—a property similar to second-kind integral equations.",
