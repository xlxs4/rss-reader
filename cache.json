          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we first derive a theoretical basis for spherical conformal parameterizations between a simply connected closed surface \n                      \n                      \\(\\mathcal {S}\\)\n                      \n                     and a unit sphere \n                      \n                      \\(\\mathbb {S}^2\\)\n                      \n                     by minimizing the Dirichlet energy on \n                      \n                      \\(\\overline{\\mathbb {C}}\\)\n                      \n                     with stereographic projection. The Dirichlet energy can be rewritten as the sum of the energies associated with the southern and northern hemispheres and can be decreased under an equivalence relation by alternatingly solving the corresponding Laplacian equations. Based on this theoretical foundation, we develop a modified Dirichlet energy minimization with nonequivalence deflation for the computation of the spherical conformal parameterization between \n                      \n                      \\(\\mathcal {S}\\)\n                      \n                     and \n                      \n                      \\(\\mathbb {S}^2\\)\n                      \n                    . In addition, under some mild conditions, we verify the asymptotically R-linear convergence of the proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments on various benchmarks confirm that the assumptions for convergence always hold and demonstrate the efficiency, reliability and robustness of the developed modified Dirichlet energy minimization.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we locally construct a conservative flux for finite element solutions of elliptic interface problems with discontinuous coefficients. Since the Discontinuous Galerkin method has built-in conservative flux, we consider in this paper the conforming finite element method and a special type of nonconforming method with arbitrary orders. We also perform our analysis based on Nitsche’s method, which imposes the Dirichlet boundary condition weakly. The construction method is derived based on a mixed problem with one solution coinciding with the finite element solution and with the other solution being naturally used to obtain a conservative flux. We then apply the recovered flux to the a posteriori error estimation and prove the robust reliability and efficiency for conforming elements, under the assumption that the diffusion coefficient is quasi-monotone. Numerical experiments are provided to verify the theoretical results.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose a class of discontinuous Galerkin methods under the scalar auxiliary variable framework (SAV-DG) to solve a biological patterning model in the form of parabolic–elliptic partial differential equation system. In particular, mixed-type discontinuous Galerkin approximations are used for the spatial discretization, aiming to achieve a balance between the high resolution and computational cost. Second and third order backward differentiation formulas are considered under SAV framework for discrete energy stability. Numerical experiments are provided to show the effectiveness of the fully discrete schemes and the governing factors of patterning formation.",
