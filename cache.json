          "description": "Abstract\nWe propose a new approach to generate a reliable reduced model for a parametric elliptic problem, in the presence of noisy data. The reference model reduction procedure is the directional HiPOD method, which combines Hierarchical Model reduction with a standard Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, according to an offline/online paradigm. In this paper we show that directional HiPOD looses in terms of accuracy when problem data are affected by noise. This is due to the interpolation driving the online phase, since it replicates, by definition, the noise trend. To overcome this limit, we replace interpolation with Machine Learning fitting models which better discriminate relevant physical features in the data from irrelevant unstructured noise. The numerical assessment, although preliminary, confirms the potentialities of the new approach.",

The symplectic Runge-Kutta method in time, together with the Fourier pseudo-spectral method in space is employed to compute the solution of the reformulated system. The main benefit of the proposed schemes is that it can achieve arbitrarily high-order accurate in time and conserve the three invariants: mass, Hamiltonian energy and two linear invariants.

          "description": "Abstract\nMembrane problems commonly encountered in engineering and biological applications involve large deformations and complex configurations. Immersed boundary (IB) method, formulated by the fluid equations in which the fluid-structure interaction is described in terms of the Dirac function, is one of the most powerful tools to simulate such problems. However, the IB method suffers from severe time step restrictions to maintain stability if the discretization lacks conservation of energy, especially for two-phase flows. In this paper, we develop an energy stable IB method for solving deformable membrane problems with non-uniform density and viscosity. Unlike the classic IB formulation, the evolution of membrane, including elastic tension and bending force, is controlled by its tangent angle and arc length. After minor modifications, it is shown that the model satisfies the continuous energy law. Thus, for the reformulated model, we proposed an implicit unconditionally energy stable scheme, where the energy of the scheme is proved to be dissipative. The resultant system is solved iteratively and the numerical results show that the proposed scheme is energy stable and capable of predicting the dynamics of extensible and inextensible interface problems with non-uniform density and viscosity.",

In particular, we establish a series of new quadrature rules for this transform and carry out rigorous analysis, including the cases that the oscillator g(x) has either zeros or stationary points.

In the latter case, we take advantage of the natural adjoint-like properties of generative models and the ability to simulate forwards and backwards in time. GANs have received much attention recently, after achieving excellent results for their generation of realistic-looking images. We wish to explore how this property translates to new applications in computational modelling and to exploit the adjoint-like properties for efficient data assimilation. We apply these methods to a compartmental model in epidemiology that is able to model space and time variations, and that mimics the spread of COVID-19 in an idealised town. To do this, the GAN is set within a reduced-order model, which uses a low-dimensional space for the spatial distribution of the simulation states. Then the GAN learns the evolution of the low-dimensional states over time. The results show that the proposed methods can accurately predict the evolution of the high-fidelity numerical simulation, and can efficiently assimilate observed data and determine the corresponding model parameters.",
