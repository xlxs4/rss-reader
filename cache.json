          "description": "Abstract\nIn this work, we propose adaptive deep learning approaches based on normalizing flows for solving fractional Fokker–Planck equations (FPEs). The solution of a FPE is a probability density function (PDF). Traditional mesh-based methods are ineffective because of a unbounded computation domain, a large number of dimensions and a nonlocal fractional operator. To this end, we represent the solution with an explicit PDF model induced by a flow-based deep generative model, which constructs a transport map from a simple distribution to the target distribution. We consider two methods to approximate the fractional Laplacian. One method is the Monte Carlo approximation. The other method is to construct an auxiliary model with Gaussian radial basis functions (GRBFs) to approximate the solution such that we may take advantage of the fact that the fractional Laplacian of a Gaussian is known analytically. Based on these two different ways for the approximation of the fractional Laplacian, we propose two models to approximate stationary FPEs and one model to approximate time-dependent FPEs. To further improve the accuracy, we refine the training set and the approximate solution alternately. A variety of numerical examples is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptive deep density approaches.",

To handle the non-smooth multi-phase labeling model, we introduce a quadratic proximal term, resulting in a strongly convex model. This paper provides theoretical evidence supporting the convergence of the proposed non-overlapping DDMs. Specifically, it is demonstrated that the non-overlapping DDMs for the non-smooth labeling model exhibits an O(1/n) convergence rate of the energy functional, where n is the number of iterations. Moreover, the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (Beck and Teboulle in SIAM J Imaging Sci 2(1):183–202, 2009) is applied to achieve an \n                      \n                      \\(O(1/n^2)\\)\n                      \n                     convergence rate.

By providing a linear error analysis and utilizing a Strang splitting-type approach, we construct them on the basis of orthogonal Runge–Kutta–Chebyshev methods of order 2. Our methods are of weak order 2 and have high computational accuracy for relatively large time-step size, as well as good stability properties. In addition, we take stochastic exponential RK methods of weak order 2 as competitors, and deal with implementation issues on Krylov subspace projection techniques for them. We carry out numerical experiments on a variety of linear and nonlinear problems to check the computational performance of the methods. As a result, it is shown that the proposed methods can be very effective on high-dimensional problems whose drift term has eigenvalues lying near the negative real axis and whose diffusion term does not have very large noise.",

We present a fast direct solver for boundary integral equations on complex surfaces in three dimensions using an extension of the recently introduced recursive strong skeletonization scheme. For problems that are not highly oscillatory, our algorithm computes an [math]-like hierarchical factorization of the dense system matrix, permitting application of the inverse in [math] time, where [math] is the number of unknowns on the surface. The factorization itself also scales linearly with the system size, albeit with a somewhat larger constant. The scheme is built on a level-restricted adaptive octree data structure, and therefore, it is compatible with highly nonuniform discretizations. Furthermore, the scheme is coupled with high-order accurate locally-corrected Nyström quadrature methods to integrate the singular and weakly-singular Green’s functions used in the integral representations. Our method has immediate applications to a variety of problems in computational physics. We concentrate here on studying its performance in acoustic scattering (governed by the Helmholtz equation) at low to moderate frequencies, and provide rigorous justification for compression of submatrices via proxy surfaces.",

Chemical reactions can be modeled by a random time-changed Poisson process on countable states. The macroscopic behaviors, such as large fluctuations, can be studied via the WKB reformulation. The WKB reformulation for the backward equation is Varadhan’s discrete nonlinear semigroup and is also a monotone scheme that approximates the limiting first-order Hamilton–Jacobi equations (HJE). The discrete Hamiltonian is an m-accretive operator, which generates a nonlinear semigroup on countable grids and justifies the well-posedness of the chemical master equation and the backward equation with “no reaction” boundary conditions. The convergence from the monotone schemes to the viscosity solution of HJE is proved by constructing barriers to overcome the polynomial growth coefficients in the Hamiltonian. This implies the convergence of Varadhan’s discrete nonlinear semigroup to the continuous Lax–Oleinik semigroup and leads to the large deviation principle for the chemical reaction process at any single time. Consequently, the macroscopic mean-field limit reaction rate equation is recovered with a concentration rate estimate. Furthermore, we establish the convergence from a reversible invariant measure to an upper semicontinuous viscosity solution of the stationary HJE.",

We study a Stokes system posed in a thin perforated layer with a Navier-slip condition on the internal oscillating boundary from two viewpoints: (1) dimensional reduction of the layer and (2) homogenization of the perforated structure. Assuming the perforations are periodic, both aspects can be described through a small parameter [math], which is related to the thickness of the layer as well as the size of the periodic structure. By letting [math] tend to zero, we prove that the sequence of solutions converges to a limit which satisfies a well-defined macroscopic problem. More precisely, the limit velocity and limit pressure satisfy a two pressure Stokes model, from which a Darcy law for thin layers can be derived. Due to nonstandard boundary conditions, some additional terms appear in Darcy’s law.",

Developing a model to capture all aspects of a complex dynamical system is an immense task, and each model will have deficiencies in some areas, such as global climate models having difficulty in capturing tropical intraseasonal variability such as the Madden–Julian oscillation. Besides complex models, it is possible to create simplified, low-dimensional models to capture specific phenomena while ignoring many aspects of the full system. Here, we propose a strategy to allow complex models to communicate with simplified models throughout a simulation. The communication allows one to leverage the strengths of each model, without needing to change their dynamics, to mitigate model error. Furthermore, to ensure ease of implementation in complex systems, the strategy is based on common data assimilation techniques that are normally used to combine models and real-world data. This strategy is investigated here in a test case that is nonlinear, non-Gaussian, and high-dimensional (approximately [math] degrees of freedom), and the multiple models have different state spaces. In particular, it is an idealized tropical climate model in three spatial dimensions. The multimodel communication strategy is seen to mitigate model error and reproduce statistical features akin to those of the truth model when the communication is sufficiently frequent. In these tests, the low-dimensional model contributes only two degrees of freedom, which suggests that, in some systems, large amounts of model error can possibly be reduced by focusing on a small set of model components.",

We propose a framework to study tipping points in reaction-diffusion equations (RDEs) in one spatial dimension, where the reaction term decays in space (asymptotically homogeneous) and varies linearly with time (nonautonomous) due to an external input. A compactification of the moving-frame coordinate together with Lin’s method to construct heteroclinic orbits along intersections of stable and unstable invariant manifolds allows us to (i) obtain multiple coexisting pulse and front solutions for the RDE by computing heteroclinic orbits connecting equilibria at negative and positive infinity in the compactified moving-frame ordinary differential equation, (ii) detect tipping points as dangerous bifurcations of such heteroclinic orbits, and (iii) obtain tipping diagrams by numerical continuation of such bifurcations. We apply our framework to an illustrative model of a habitat patch that features an Allee effect in population growth and is geographically shrinking or shifting due to human activity or climate change. Thus, we identify two classes of tipping points to extinction: bifurcation-induced tipping (B-tipping) when the shrinking habitat falls below some critical length and rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) when the shifting habitat exceeds some critical speed. We explore two-parameter R-tipping diagrams to understand how the critical speed depends on the size of the habitat patch and the dispersal rate of the population, uncover parameter regions where the shifting population survives, and relate these regions to the invasion speed in an infinite homogeneous habitat. Furthermore, we contrast the tipping instabilities with gradual transitions to extinction found for logistic population growth without the Allee effect.",

We consider the logistic metapopulation model over a stream network and use the metapopulation growth rate and the total biomass (of the positive equilibrium) as metrics for different aspects of population persistence. Our objective is to find distributions of resources that maximize these persistence measures. We begin our study by considering stream networks consisting of three nodes and prove that the strategy to maximize the total biomass is to concentrate all the resources in the most upstream locations. In contrast, when the diffusion rates are sufficiently small, the metapopulation growth rate is maximized when all resources are concentrated in one of the most downstream locations.

We propose a non-local model for contact guidance and steric hindrance depending on a single external cue, namely the extracellular matrix, that affects in a twofold way the polarization and speed of motion of the cells. We start from a microscopic description of the stochastic processes underlying the cell re-orientation mechanism related to the change of cell speed and direction. Then, we formally derive the corresponding kinetic model that implements exactly the prescribed microscopic dynamics, and, from it, it is possible to deduce the macroscopic limit in the appropriate regime. Moreover, we test our model in several scenarios. In particular, we numerically investigate the minimal microscopic mechanisms that are necessary to reproduce cell dynamics by comparing the outcomes of our model with some experimental results related to breast cancer cell migration. This allows us to validate the proposed modeling approach and to highlight its capability of predicting qualitative cell behaviors in diverse heterogeneous microenvironments.",

A homogenized model is developed to describe the interaction between aligned strings and an incompressible, viscous, Newtonian fluid. In the case of many strings, the ratio of string separation to domain width gives a small parameter which can be exploited to simplify the problem. Model derivation using multiscale asymptotics results in a modified Darcy law for fluid flow, with coefficients determined by averaged solutions to microscale problems. Fluid flow is coupled to solid deformation via a homogenized force balance obtained by coarse-graining the balance on each string. This approach offers an alternative method to systematically derive the equations governing the interaction of Stokes flow with many flexible structures. The resulting model of fluid-structure interaction is reduced to a single scalar, linear, partial differential equation by introducing a potential for the pressure. Analytical solutions are presented for a cylindrical geometry subject to time-harmonic motion of the string ends. Scaling laws are identified that describe the variation of shear stress exerted on the string surface with the forcing frequency.",

We consider a phenotype-switching chemotaxis model for aggregation, in which a chemotactic population is capable of switching back and forth between a chemotaxing state (performing chemotactic movement) and a secreting state (producing the attractant). We show that the switching rate provides a powerful mechanism for controlling the densities of spontaneously emerging aggregates. Specifically, in two- and three-dimensional settings it is shown that when both switching rates coincide and are suitably large, the densities of both the chemotaxing and the secreting populations will exceed any prescribed level at some points in the considered domain. This is complemented by two results asserting the absence of such aggregation phenomena in corresponding scenarios in which one of the switching rates remains within some bounded interval.",

Laws of large numbers guarantee that given a large enough sample from some population, the measure of any fixed subpopulation is well-estimated by its frequency in the sample. We study laws of large numbers in sampling processes that can affect the environment they are acting upon and interact with it. Specifically, we consider the sequential sampling model proposed by [O. Ben-Eliezer and E. Yogev, The adversarial robustness of sampling, in Proceedings of the 39th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS), 2020, pp. 49–62] and characterize the classes which admit a uniform law of large numbers in this model: these are exactly the classes that are online learnable. Our characterization may be interpreted as an online analogue to the equivalence between learnability and uniform convergence in statistical (PAC) learning. The sample-complexity bounds we obtain are tight for many parameter regimes, and as an application, we determine the optimal regret bounds in online learning, stated in terms of Littlestone’s dimension, thus resolving the main open question from [S.

We consider the problem of designing fundamental graph algorithms on the model of massively parallel computation (MPC). The input to the problem is an undirected graph [math] with [math] vertices and [math] edges and with [math] being the maximum diameter of any connected component in [math]. We consider the MPC with low local space, allowing each machine to store only [math] words for an arbitrary constant [math] and with linear global space (which is the number of machines times the local space available), that is, with optimal utilization. In a recent breakthrough, Andoni et al. [Parallel graph connectivity in log diameter rounds, 2018] and Behnezhad, Hajiaghayi, and Harris [Exponentially faster massively parallel maximal matching, 2019] designed parallel randomized algorithms that in [math] rounds on an MPC with low local space determine all connected components of a graph, improving on the classic bound of [math] derived from earlier works on PRAM algorithms. In this paper, we show that asymptotically identical bounds can be also achieved for deterministic algorithms: We present a deterministic MPC low local space algorithm that in [math] rounds determines connected components of the input graph. Our result matches the complexity of state-of-the-art randomized algorithms for this task. We complement our upper bounds by extending a recent lower bound for the connectivity on an MPC conditioned on the 1-vs-2-cycles conjecture (which requires [math]) by showing a related conditional hardness of [math] MPC rounds for the entire spectrum of [math], covering a particularly interesting range when [math].",
