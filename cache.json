          "description": "Abstract\nExtreme learning machine (ELM) is a type of randomized neural networks originally developed for linear classification and regression problems in the mid-2000s, and has recently been extended to computational partial differential equations (PDE). This method can yield highly accurate solutions to linear/nonlinear PDEs, but requires the last hidden layer of the neural network to be wide to achieve a high accuracy. If the last hidden layer is narrow, the accuracy of the existing ELM method will be poor, irrespective of the rest of the network configuration. In this paper we present a modified ELM method, termed HLConcELM (hidden-layer concatenated ELM), to overcome the above drawback of the conventional ELM method. The HLConcELM method can produce highly accurate solutions to linear/nonlinear PDEs when the last hidden layer of the network is narrow and when it is wide. The new method is based on a type of modified feedforward neural networks (FNN), termed HLConcFNN (hidden-layer concatenated FNN), which incorporates a logical concatenation of the hidden layers in the network and exposes all the hidden nodes to the output-layer nodes. HLConcFNNs have the interesting property that, given a network architecture, when additional hidden layers are appended to the network or when extra nodes are added to the existing hidden layers, the representation capacity of the HLConcFNN associated with the new architecture is guaranteed to be not smaller than that of the original network architecture. Here representation capacity refers to the set of all functions that can be exactly represented by the neural network of a given architecture. We present ample benchmark tests with linear/nonlinear PDEs to demonstrate the computational accuracy and performance of the HLConcELM method and the superiority of this method to the conventional ELM from previous works.",

          "description": "Abstract\nHigher-order Markov chain plays an important role in analyzing a variety of stochastic processes over time in multi-dimensional spaces. One of the important applications is the study of higher-order PageRank problem. The truncated power method proposed recently provides us with another idea to solve this problem, however, its accuracy and efficiency can be poor in practical computations. In this work, we revisit the higher-order PageRank problem and consider how to solve it efficiently. The contribution of this work is as follows. First, we accelerate the truncated power method for higher-order PageRank. In the improved version, it is neither to form and store the vectors arising from the dangling states, nor to store an auxiliary matrix. Second, we propose a truncated power method with partially updating to further release the overhead, in which one only needs to update some important columns of the approximation in each iteration. However, the truncated power method solves a modified higher-order PageRank model for convenience, which is not mathematically equivalent to the original one. Thus, the third contribution of this work is to propose a sparse power method with partially updating for the original higher-order PageRank problem. The convergence of all the proposed methods are discussed. Numerical experiments on large and sparse real-world and synthetic data sets are performed. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our new algorithms over some state-of-the-art ones for large and sparse higher-order PageRank problems.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIt is quite common that a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) admits multiple distinct solutions and each solution may carry a unique physical meaning. One typical approach for finding multiple solutions is to use the Newton method with different initial guesses that ideally fall into the basins of attraction confining the solutions. In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate numerical method for multiple solutions comprised of three ingredients: (i) a well-designed spectral-Galerkin discretization of the underlying PDE leading to a nonlinear algebraic system (NLAS) with multiple solutions; (ii) an effective deflation technique to eliminate a known (founded) solution from the other unknown solutions leading to deflated NLAS; and (iii) a viable nonlinear least-squares and trust-region (LSTR) method for solving the NLAS and the deflated NLAS to find the multiple solutions sequentially one by one. We demonstrate through ample examples of differential equations and comparison with relevant existing approaches that the spectral LSTR-Deflation method has the merits: (i) it is quite flexible in choosing initial values, even starting from the same initial guess for finding all multiple solutions; (ii) it guarantees high-order accuracy; and (iii) it is quite fast to locate multiple distinct solutions and explore new solutions which are not reported in literature.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe address the solution of large-scale Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) with infinite-dimensional parameter fields. The OED problem seeks to find sensor locations that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) in the solution of the underlying Bayesian inverse problem. Computation of the EIG is usually prohibitive for PDE-based OED problems. To make the evaluation of the EIG tractable, we approximate the (PDE-based) parameter-to-observable map with a derivative-informed projected neural network (DIPNet) surrogate, which exploits the geometry, smoothness, and intrinsic low-dimensionality of the map using a small and dimension-independent number of PDE solves. The surrogate is then deployed within a greedy algorithm-based solution of the OED problem such that no further PDE solves are required. We analyze the EIG approximation error in terms of the generalization error of the DIPNet and show they are of the same order. Finally, the efficiency and accuracy of the method are demonstrated via numerical experiments on OED problems governed by inverse scattering and inverse reactive transport with up to 16,641 uncertain parameters and 100 experimental design variables, where we observe up to three orders of magnitude speedup relative to a reference double loop Monte Carlo method.",

Based on the evolving surface finite element method, the first-order and second-order standard semi-implicit schemes are shown and analyzed to be conditionally stable. The energy dissipation law of the binary fluid-surfactant phase field model does not hold for evolving surfaces with arbitrary surface velocities which can be viewed as an action of external force. Therefore, this paper is dedicated to addressing the difficulties of conditional stability and numerical stiffness caused by the small interfacial parameters instead of energy stability. The first-order and second-order stabilizing approaches are employed to improve the stabilities of semi-implicit schemes. For the efficiency of long time simulation, an adaptive time-stepping technique considering energy evolution and surface velocity is developed. The effectiveness of the proposed stabilizing and adaptive time-stepping approaches is verified by numerical experiments. Various numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, and numerically investigate the behavior of the binary fluid-surfactant on evolving surfaces.",

We investigate the linear stability analysis of a pathway-based diffusion model (PBDM), which characterizes the dynamics of the engineered Escherichia coli populations [X. Xue, C. Xue, and M. Tang, PLoS Comput. Biol., 14 (2018), e1006178]. This stability analysis considers small perturbations of the density and chemical concentration around two nontrivial steady states, and the linearized equations are transformed into a generalized eigenvalue problem. By formal analysis, when the internal variable responds to the outside signal fast enough, the PBDM converges to an anisotropic diffusion model, for which the probability density distribution in the internal variable becomes a delta function. We introduce an asymptotic preserving (AP) scheme for the PBDM that converges to a stable limit scheme consistent with the anisotropic diffusion model. Further numerical simulations demonstrate the theoretical results of linear stability analysis, i.e., the pattern formation, and the convergence of the AP scheme.",

          "description": "Multiscale Modeling & Simulation, Volume 21, Issue 1, Page 309-348, March 2023. \n Abstract. We derive the PDE governing the hydrodynamic limit of a Metropolis rate crystal surface height process in the “rough scaling” regime introduced by Marzuola and Weare. The PDE takes the form of a continuity equation, and the expression for the current involves a numerically computed multiplicative correction term similar to a mobility. The correction accounts for the fact that, unusually, the local equilibrium distribution of the process is not a local Gibbs measure even though the global equilibrium distribution is Gibbs. We give definitive numerical evidence of this fact, originally suggested by Y. Gao, A. E. Katsevich, J.-G. Liu, J. Lu, and J. L. Marzuola [Pure Appl. Anal., 3 (2021), pp. 595–612]. In that paper, an approximate PDE—our PDE, but without the correction term—was derived for the limit of the Metropolis rate process under the assumption of a local Gibbs distribution. Our main contribution is to present a numerical method to compute the corrected macroscopic current, which is given by a function of the third spatial derivative of the height profile. Our method exploits properties of the local equilibrium (LE) state of the third order finite difference process. We find that the LE state of this process is not only useful for deriving the PDE, it also enjoys nonstandard properties which are interesting in their own right. Namely, we demonstrate that the LE state is a “rough LE,” a novel kind of LE state discovered in our recent work on an Arrhenius rate crystal surface process.",

This article considers the minimization of the total number of infected individuals over the course of an epidemic in which the rate of infectious contacts can be reduced by time-dependent nonpharmaceutical interventions. The societal and economic costs of interventions are taken into account using a linear budget constraint which imposes a trade-off between short-term heavy interventions and long-term light interventions. We search for an optimal intervention strategy in an infinite-dimensional space of controls containing multiple consecutive lockdowns, gradually imposed and lifted restrictions, and various heuristic controls based, for example, on tracking the effective reproduction number. Mathematical analysis shows that among all such strategies, the global optimum is achieved by a single constant-level lockdown of maximum possible magnitude. Numerical simulations highlight the need for careful timing of such interventions and illustrate their benefits and disadvantages compared to strategies designed for minimizing peak prevalence. Rather counterintuitively, adding restrictions prior to the start of a well-planned intervention strategy may even increase the total incidence.",

We present an analytical approach to the problem of predicting the finger width of a simple fluid driving a non-Newtonian (power-law) fluid. Our analysis is based on the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation, by representing the deviation from the Newtonian viscosity as a singular perturbation in a parameter, leading to a solvability condition at the finger tip, which selects a unique finger width from the family of solutions. We find that the relation between the dimensionless finger width, [math], and the dimensionless group of parameters containing the viscosity and surface tension, [math], has the form [math] for the shear thinning case and [math] for the shear thickening case, in the limit of small [math]. This theoretical estimate is compared with the existing experimental, finger width data as well as the one computed with the linearized model, and a good agreement is found near the power-law exponent, [math].",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 52, Issue 2, Page 327-357, April 2023. \n Abstract. We study the Generalized Min Sum Set Cover (GMSSC) problem, wherein given a collection of hyperedges [math] with arbitrary covering requirements [math], the goal is to find an ordering of the vertices to minimize the total cover time of the hyperedges; a hyperedge [math] is considered covered by the first time when [math] and many of its vertices appear in the ordering. We give a [math] approximation algorithm for GMSSC, coming close to the best possible bound of 4, already for the classical special case (with all [math]) of Min Sum Set Cover (MSSC) studied by Feige, Lovász, and Tetali, and improving upon the previous best known bound of [math] due to Im, Sviridenko, and van der Zwaan. Our algorithm is based on transforming the LP solution by a suitable kernel and applying randomized rounding. As part of the analysis of our algorithm, we also derive an inequality on the lower tail of a sum of independent Bernoulli random variables, which might be of independent interest and broader utility. Min Sum Vertex Cover (MSVC) is a well-known special case of MSSC in which the input hypergraph is a graph (i.e., [math]) and [math] for every edge [math]. We give a [math] approximation for MSVC and show a matching integrality gap for the natural LP relaxation. This improves upon the previous best [math] approximation of Barenholz, Feige, and Peleg. Finally, we revisit MSSC and consider the [math] norm of cover-time of the hyperedges. Using a dual fitting argument, we show that the natural greedy algorithm achieves tight, up to NP-hardness, approximation guarantees of [math] for all [math], giving another proof of the result of Golovin, Gupta, Kumar, and Tangwongsan, and showing its tightness up to NP-hardness. For [math], this gives yet another proof of the 4 approximation for MSSC.",
