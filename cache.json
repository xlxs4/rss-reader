          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a new class of high-order fast multi-resolution essentially non-oscillatory (FMRENO) schemes is proposed with an emphasis on both the performance and the computational efficiency. First, a new candidate stencil arrangement is developed for a multi-resolution representation of the local flow scales. A set of candidate stencils ranging from high- to low-order (from large to small stencils) is constructed in a hierarchical manner. Second, the monotonicity-preserving (MP) limiter is introduced as the regularity criterion of the candidate stencils. A candidate stencil, with which the reconstructed cell interface flux locates within the MP lower and upper bounds, is regarded to be smooth. Third, a multi-resolution stencil selection strategy, which prioritizes the stencils with better spectral property or higher-order accuracy meanwhile satisfying the MP criterion, is proposed. If all the candidate stencils are judged to be nonsmooth, the targeted stencil that violates the MP criterion the least is deployed as the final reconstruction instead. With this new framework, the desirable high-order accuracy is restored in the smooth regions while the sharp shock-capturing capability is achieved by selecting the targeted stencil satisfying the MP criterion most. Moreover, the new FMRENO schemes feature low numerical dissipation for resolving the broadband physical fluctuations by adaptively choosing the candidate stencil with better spectra or higher accuracy order based on the local flow regularity. Compared to the standard weighted/targeted essentially non-oscillatory (W/TENO) schemes, the computational efficiency is dramatically enhanced by avoiding the expensive evaluations of the classical smoothness indicators. A set of benchmark simulations demonstrate the performance of the new FMRENO schemes for handling complex fluid problems with a wide range of length scales.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a novel multigrid method based on Newton iteration is proposed to solve nonlinear eigenvalue problems. Instead of handling the eigenvalue \n                      \n                      \\(\\lambda \\)\n                      \n                     and eigenfunction u separately, we treat the eigenpair \n                      \n                      \\((\\lambda , u)\\)\n                      \n                     as one element in a product space \n                      \n                      \\({\\mathbb {R}} \\times H_0^1(\\Omega )\\)\n                      \n                    . Then in the presented multigrid method, only one discrete linear boundary value problem needs to be solved for each level of the multigrid sequence. Because we avoid solving large-scale nonlinear eigenvalue problems directly, the overall efficiency is significantly improved. The optimal error estimate and linear computational complexity can be derived simultaneously. In addition, we also provide an improved multigrid method coupled with a mixing scheme to further guarantee the convergence and stability of the iteration scheme. More importantly, we prove convergence for the residuals after each iteration step. For nonlinear eigenvalue problems, such theoretical analysis is missing from the existing literatures on the mixing iteration scheme.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose and analyze an efficient implicit–explicit second-order backward differentiation formulation (BDF2) scheme with variable time steps for gradient flow problems using a scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach. Comparing with the traditional second-order SAV approach (Shen et al. in J Comput Phys 353:407–416, 2018), we only use a first-order method to approximate the auxiliary variable. This treatment does not affect the second-order accuracy of the unknown function \n                      \n                      \\(\\phi \\)\n                      \n                    , and is essentially important for deriving the unconditional energy stability of the proposed BDF2 scheme with variable time steps. We prove the unconditional energy stability of the scheme for a modified discrete energy with the adjacent time step ratio \n                      \n                      \\(\\gamma _{n+1}:=\\tau _{n+1}/\\tau _{n}\\le 4.8645\\)\n                      \n                    .

Based on this uniform bound of the numerical solution, a rigorous error estimate of the proposed scheme is carried out on the nonuniform temporal mesh. Finally, serval numerical tests are provided to validate the theoretical claims. With the application of an adaptive time-stepping strategy, the efficiency of our proposed scheme can be clearly observed in the coarsening dynamics simulation.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this work the development of a machine learning-based Reduced Order Model (ROM) for the investigation of hemodynamics in a patient-specific configuration of Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) is proposed. The computational domain is referred to left branches of coronary arteries when a stenosis of the Left Main Coronary Artery (LMCA) occurs. The method extracts a reduced basis space from a collection of high-fidelity solutions via a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) algorithm and employs Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for the computation of the modal coefficients. The Full Order Model (FOM) is represented by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations discretized using a Finite Volume (FV) technique. Both physical and geometrical parametrization are taken into account, the former one related to the inlet flow rate and the latter one related to the stenosis severity. With respect to the previous works focused on the development of a ROM framework for the evaluation of coronary artery disease, the novelties of our study include the use of the FV method in a patient-specific configuration, the use of a data-driven ROM technique and the mesh deformation strategy based on a Free Form Deformation (FFD) technique. The performance of our ROM approach is analyzed in terms of the error between full order and reduced order solutions as well as the speed-up achieved at the online stage.",

For the first time, we strictly prove that the augmented subspace methods have the second order convergence rate between the two iteration steps, which is better than the existing theoretical results in Lin and Xie (Math Comp 84:71–88, 2015), Xie et al. (SIAM J Numer Anal 57(6):2519–2550, 2019), Xu et al. (SIAM J Sci Comput 42(5):A2655–A2677, 2020) and more consistent with the results of actual numerical test. These sharper estimates explicitly depict the dependence of convergence rate on the coarse spaces, which provides new advantages for the augmented subspace methods.

          "description": "Abstract\nWe propose a new approach to generate a reliable reduced model for a parametric elliptic problem, in the presence of noisy data. The reference model reduction procedure is the directional HiPOD method, which combines Hierarchical Model reduction with a standard Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, according to an offline/online paradigm. In this paper we show that directional HiPOD looses in terms of accuracy when problem data are affected by noise. This is due to the interpolation driving the online phase, since it replicates, by definition, the noise trend.

The main idea of the scheme is first to introduce an quadratic auxiliary variable to transform the Hamiltonian energy into a modified quadratic energy and the original system is then reformulated into an equivalent system which satisfies the mass, modified energy as well as two linear invariants. The symplectic Runge-Kutta method in time, together with the Fourier pseudo-spectral method in space is employed to compute the solution of the reformulated system. The main benefit of the proposed schemes is that it can achieve arbitrarily high-order accurate in time and conserve the three invariants: mass, Hamiltonian energy and two linear invariants. In addition, an efficient fixed-point iteration is proposed to solve the resulting nonlinear equations of the proposed schemes. Several experiments are addressed to validate the theoretical results.",

We first establish global superconvergent error bounds for the postprocessed CG approximations over arbitrary time partitions, and as a by-product, it is shown that the convergence rates of the \n                      \n                      \\(L^2\\)\n                      \n                    -, \n                      \n                      \\(H^1\\)\n                      \n                    - and \n                      \n                      \\(L^\\infty \\)\n                      \n                    -estimates for the CG method with quasi-uniform meshes for smooth solutions are improved by one order.

          "description": "Abstract\nMembrane problems commonly encountered in engineering and biological applications involve large deformations and complex configurations. Immersed boundary (IB) method, formulated by the fluid equations in which the fluid-structure interaction is described in terms of the Dirac function, is one of the most powerful tools to simulate such problems. However, the IB method suffers from severe time step restrictions to maintain stability if the discretization lacks conservation of energy, especially for two-phase flows. In this paper, we develop an energy stable IB method for solving deformable membrane problems with non-uniform density and viscosity. Unlike the classic IB formulation, the evolution of membrane, including elastic tension and bending force, is controlled by its tangent angle and arc length. After minor modifications, it is shown that the model satisfies the continuous energy law. Thus, for the reformulated model, we proposed an implicit unconditionally energy stable scheme, where the energy of the scheme is proved to be dissipative. The resultant system is solved iteratively and the numerical results show that the proposed scheme is energy stable and capable of predicting the dynamics of extensible and inextensible interface problems with non-uniform density and viscosity.",
