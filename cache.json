          "description": "Abstract\nIn this study, we present a second-order time-accurate unconditionally stable numerical method for a gradient flow for the Modica–Mortola functional with an equispaced multiple well potential. The proposed second-order time-accurate unconditionally stable numerical method is based on the operator splitting method. The nonlinear and linear terms in the gradient flow are solved analytically and using the Fourier spectral method, respectively. The numerical solutions in each step are bounded for any time step size and the overall scheme is temporally second-order accurate. We prove theoretically the unconditional stability and boundedness of the numerical solutions. In addition, several numerical tests are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this work, we consider the numerical solutions of a dispersion-managed nonlinear Schrödinger equation (DM-NLS) and a nonlinearity-managed NLS equation (NM-NLS). The two equations arise from the soliton managements in optics and matter waves, and they involve temporal discontinuous coefficients with possible frequent jumps and stiffness which cause numerical difficulties. We analyze to see the order reduction problems of some popular traditional methods, and then we propose a class of exponential-type dispersion-map integrators for both DM-NLS and NM-NLS. The proposed methods are explicit, efficient under Fourier pseudospectral discretizations and second order accurate in time regardless the jumps/jump-period in the dispersion map. The extension to the fast & strong management regime of DM-NLS is made with uniform accuracy.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe derive a fully-discrete finite element scheme to a fractional Timoshenko beam model, which characterizes the mechanical responses of viscoelastic beams, thick beams and beams subject to high-frequency excitations by properly considering the effects of both transverse shear and rotational inertia. We prove high-order regularity of the solutions to the model and then accordingly prove error estimates of the numerical scheme. Numerical experiments are performed to substantiate the numerical analysis results and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the fractional Timoshenko beam model in modeling the mechanical vibrations of different beams, in comparison with its integer-order analogue and the widely-used integer-order and fractional Euler-Bernoulli beam models.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe use trivariate spline functions for the numerical solution of the Dirichlet problem of the 3D elliptic Monge-Ampére equation. Mainly we use the spline collocation method introduced in [SIAM J. Numerical Analysis, 2405-2434,2022] to numerically solve iterative Poisson equations and use an averaged algorithm to ensure the convergence of the iterations. We shall also establish the rate of convergence under a sufficient condition and provide some numerical evidence to show the numerical rates. Then we present many computational results to demonstrate that this approach works very well. In particular, we tested many known convex solutions as well as nonconvex solutions over convex and nonconvex domains and compared them with several existing numerical methods to show the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.",

          "description": "Abstract\nA novel approach for the stabilization of the discontinuous Galerkin method based on the Dafermos entropy rate crition is presented. The approach is centered around the efficient solution of linear or nonlinear optimization problems in every timestep as a correction to the basic discontinuous Galerkin scheme. The thereby enforced Dafermos criterion results in improved stability compared to the basic method while retaining a high order of accuracy in numerical experiments for scalar conservation laws. Further modification of the optimization problem allows also to enforce classical entropy inequalities for the scheme. The proposed stabilization is therefore an alternative to flux-differencing to enforce entropy inequalities. As the shock-capturing abilities of the scheme are also enhanced is the method also an alternative to finite-volume subcells, artificial viscosity, modal filtering, and other shock capturing procedures in one space dimension. Tests are carried out for Burgers’ equation.",
