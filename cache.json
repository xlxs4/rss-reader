We show that the proposed numerical scheme is well-posed, and validates numerically that it has the same properties as classical HDG methods, including optimal convergence, and superconvergence of postprocessed solutions. For polynomial degree zero, dimension one, and vanishing HDG stabilization parameter, W-HDG coincides with the Scharfetter–Gummel finite volume scheme (i.e., it produces the same system matrix). The use of local exponential weights generalizes the Scharfetter–Gummel scheme (the state-of-the-art for finite volume discretization of transport-dominated problems) to arbitrary high-order approximations.",

We present models for both noise-free and noisy scenarios, and rigorously prove the existence of solutions for each case. To solve these models, we adopt a linearization approach inspired by the difference of convex functions algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches in sparse signal recovery across various circumstances, particularly in support detection.",

The solution approximation is sought in a space-parameter separated form. The discretisation in the parameter direction is made evolve in time through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The resulting method is a Bayesian sequential estimation of the parameters.

          "description": "Abstract\nInspired by penalty-free approaches for smooth optimization problems, we propose a sequential linearized proximal gradient method (SLPG) for a class of optimization problems with orthogonality constraints and nonsmooth regularization term. This approach alternatively takes tangential steps and normal steps to improve the optimality and feasibility respectively. In SLPG, the orthonormalization process is invoked only once at the last step if high precision for feasibility is needed, showing that main iterations in SLPG are orthonormalization-free. Besides, both the tangential steps and normal steps do not involve the penalty parameter, and thus SLPG is penalty-free and avoids the inefficiency caused by possible inappropriate penalty parameter. We analyze the global convergence properties of SLPG where the tangential steps are inexactly computed. Numerical experiments illustrate the advantages of SLPG when compared with existing first-order methods.",

At each pseudo time-step of the scheme, the constraints are linearized, which yields a convex minimization problem (at every time-step) with affine equality and inequality constraints. First order conditions are established for the descent scheme at each time-step, under reasonable assumptions on the admissible set. Furthermore, under a mild time-step restriction, we prove energy decrease for the descent scheme, and show that all constraints are satisfied to second order in the time-step, regardless of the total number of time-steps taken. Moreover, we give a modification of the scheme that regularizes the inequality constraints, and establish convergence of the regularized solution. We then discretize the regularized problem with a finite element method using Hermite and Lagrange elements. Several numerical experiments are shown to illustrate the method, including an example that exhibits massive amounts of self-contact for a tightly packed curve inside a sphere.",

          "description": "Abstract\nLax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction (LWFR) is a single-stage, high order, quadrature free method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. We develop a subcell based limiter by blending LWFR with a lower order scheme, either first order finite volume or MUSCL-Hancock scheme. While the blending with a lower order scheme helps to control spurious oscillations, it may not guarantee admissibility of discrete solution, e.g., positivity property of quantities like density and pressure. By exploiting the subcell structure and admissibility of lower order schemes, we devise a strategy to ensure that the blended scheme is admissibility preserving for the mean values and then use a scaling limiter to obtain admissibility of the polynomial solution. For MUSCL-Hancock scheme on non-cell-centered subcells, we develop a slope limiter, time step restrictions and suitable blending of higher order fluxes, that ensures admissibility of lower order updates and hence that of the cell averages. By using the MUSCL-Hancock scheme on subcells and Gauss-Legendre points in flux reconstruction, we improve small-scale resolution compared to the subcell-based RKDG blending scheme with first order finite volume method and Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto points. We demonstrate the performance of our scheme on compressible Euler’s equations, showcasing its ability to handle shocks and preserve small-scale structures.",

Intended for semidiscretizations of hyperbolic partial differential equations, the herein developed approach allows the optimization of stability polynomials with more than hundred stages. A potential application of these high degree stability polynomials are problems with locally varying characteristic speeds as found for non-uniformly refined meshes and spatially varying wave speeds. To demonstrate the applicability of the stability polynomials we construct 2N-storage many-stage Runge–Kutta methods that match their designed second order of accuracy when applied to a range of linear and nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs with smooth solutions.

If the negativity happens at one checking point, a new compression limiter is carried out to ensure that the modified polynomials can achieve the positivity of density and pressure in the whole target cell instead of only at some discrete points. This treatment is easily implemented, owing to a quick and simple way to overestimate the minimum and maximum values of the polynomials of density and pressure in the target cell.

After discretization by, e.g., the finite element method, the full-order model (FOM) is solved by Dirichlet–Neumann iterations between the two sub-problems until interface convergence is reached. We then apply the reduced basis (RB) method to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the solution of each sub-problem. Furthermore, we apply the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) at the interface level to achieve a fully reduced-order representation of the DD techniques implemented. To deal with non-conforming FE interface discretizations, we employ the INTERNODES method combined with the interface DEIM reduction. The reduced-order model (ROM) is then solved by sub-iterating between the two reduced-order sub-problems until the convergence of the approximated high-fidelity interface solutions.

We study the large-scale behavior of a small-strain lattice model for a network composed of elastoplastic springs with random material properties. We formulate the model as an evolutionary rate independent system. In an earlier work we derived a homogenized continuum model, which has the form of linearized elastoplasticity, as an evolutionary [math]-limit as the lattice parameter tends to zero. In the present paper we introduce a periodic representative volume element (RVE) approximation for the homogenized system. As a main result we prove convergence of the RVE approximation as the size of the RVE tends to infinity. We also show that the hysteretic stress-strain relation of the effective system can be described with the help of a generalized Prandtl–Ishlinskii operator, and we prove convergence of a periodic RVE approximation for that operator. We combine the RVE approximation with a numerical scheme for rate-independent systems and obtain a computational scheme that we use to numerically investigate the homogenized system in the specific case when the original network is given by a two-dimensional lattice model. We simulate the response of the system to cyclic and uniaxial, monotonic loading, and numerically investigate the convergence rate of the periodic RVE approximation. In particular, our simulations show that the RVE error decays with the same rate as the RVE error in the static case of linear elasticity.",

          "description": "Multiscale Modeling & Simulation, Volume 22, Issue 1, Page 561-587, March 2024. \n Abstract. The noisy leaky integrate-and-fire (NLIF) model describes the voltage configurations of neuron networks with an interacting many-particles system at a microscopic level. When simulating neuron networks of large sizes, computing a coarse-grained mean-field Fokker–Planck equation solving the voltage densities of the networks at a macroscopic level practically serves as a feasible alternative in its high efficiency and credible accuracy when the interaction within the network remains relatively low. However, the macroscopic model fails to yield valid results of the networks when simulating considerably synchronous networks with active firing events. In this paper, we propose a multiscale solver for the NLIF networks, inheriting the macroscopic solver’s low cost and the microscopic solver’s high reliability. For each temporal step, the multiscale solver uses the macroscopic solver when the firing rate of the simulated network is low, while it switches to the microscopic solver when the firing rate tends to blow up. Moreover, the macroscopic and microscopic solvers are integrated with a high-precision switching algorithm to ensure the accuracy of the multiscale solver.

Nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations play a major role in modeling large systems of interacting particles with a proved effectiveness in describing real world phenomena ranging from classical fields such as fluids and plasma to social and biological dynamics. Their mathematical formulation often has to face physical forces having a significant random component or with particles living in a random environment whose characterization may be deduced through experimental data and leading consequently to uncertainty-dependent equilibrium states. In this work, to address the problem of effectively solving stochastic Fokker–Planck systems, we will construct a new equilibrium preserving scheme through a micro-macro approach based on stochastic Galerkin methods. The resulting numerical method, contrarily to the direct application of a stochastic Galerkin projection in the parameter space of the unknowns of the underlying Fokker–Planck model, leads to a highly accurate description of the uncertainty-dependent large time behavior. Several numerical tests in the context of collective behavior for social and life sciences are presented to assess the validity of the present methodology against standard ones.",

Koopman operator theory provides a way to solve two-dimensional nonlinear systems, under suitable restrictions, by mapping nonlinear dynamics to a linear space using Koopman eigenfunctions. Unfortunately, finding such eigenfunctions is difficult. We introduce a method for constructing Koopman eigenfunctions from a two-dimensional nonlinear ODE’s one-dimensional invariant manifolds. This method, when successful, allows us to find analytical solutions for autonomous, nonlinear systems. Previous data-driven methods have used Koopman theory to construct local Koopman eigenfunction approximations valid in different regions of phase space; our method finds analytic Koopman eigenfunctions that are exact and globally valid. We demonstrate our Koopman method of solving nonlinear systems on one-dimensional and two-dimensional ODEs. The nonlinear examples considered have simple expressions for their codimension-1 invariant manifolds which produce tractable analytical solutions. Thus our method allows for the construction of analytical solutions for previously unsolved ODEs. It also highlights the connection between invariant manifolds and eigenfunctions in nonlinear ODEs and presents avenues for extending this method to solve more nonlinear systems.",

It has become well known that the Koopman generators for control-affine systems also have affine dependence on the input, leading to convenient finite-dimensional bilinear approximations of the dynamics. Yet there are still two main obstacles that limit the scope of current approaches for approximating the Koopman generators of systems with actuation. First, the performance of existing methods depends heavily on the choice of basis functions over which the Koopman generator is to be approximated; and there is currently no universal way to choose them for systems that are not measure preserving. Second, if we do not observe the full state, then it becomes necessary to account for the dependence of the output time series on the sequence of supplied inputs when constructing observables to approximate Koopman operators. To address these issues, we write the dynamics of observables governed by the Koopman generator as a bilinear hidden Markov model and determine the model parameters using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The E step involves a standard Kalman filter and smoother, while the M step resembles control-affine dynamic mode decomposition for the generator. We demonstrate the performance of this method on three examples, including recovery of a finite-dimensional Koopman-invariant subspace for an actuated system with a slow manifold; estimation of Koopman eigenfunctions for the unforced Duffing equation; and model-predictive control of a fluidic pinball system based only on noisy observations of lift and drag.",

Competitive threshold-linear networks have long been known to exhibit multistability, where the activity of the network settles into one of potentially many steady states. In this work, we find conditions that guarantee the absence of steady states, while maintaining bounded activity. These conditions lead us to define a combinatorial family of competitive threshold-linear networks, parametrized by a simple directed graph. By exploring this family, we discover that threshold-linear networks are capable of displaying a surprisingly rich variety of nonlinear dynamics, including limit cycles, quasi-periodic attractors, and chaos. In particular, several types of nonlinear behaviors can co-exist in the same network. Our mathematical results also enable us to engineer networks with multiple dynamic patterns. Taken together, these theoretical and computational findings suggest that threshold-linear networks may be a valuable tool for understanding the relationship between network connectivity and emergent dynamics.",

A set of conservation laws is complete when the corresponding compatibility classes contain a finite number of steady states. Complete sets of conservation laws can be used for model order reduction and for studying the multistationarity of the model. We provide algorithmic methods for computing linear, monomial, and polynomial conservation laws of polynomial ODE models and for testing their completeness. The resulting conservation laws and their completeness are either independent or dependent on the parameters. In the latter case, we provide parametric case distinctions.

Since moment systems consist of a high or even infinite number of coupled equations, an indispensable step in obtaining a low-dimensional representation that is amenable to further analysis is, in many cases, to select a moment closure. A moment closure consists of a set of approximations that express certain higher-order moments in terms of lower-order ones, so that applying those leads to a closed system of equations for only the lower-order moments. Closures are frequently found drawing on intuition and heuristics to come up with quantitatively good approximations. In contrast to that, we propose an alternative approach where we instead focus on closures giving rise to certain qualitative features, such as bifurcations. Importantly, this fundamental change of perspective provides one with the possibility of classifying moment closures rigorously in regard to these features. This makes the design and selection of closures more algorithmic, precise, and reliable. In this work, we carefully study the moment systems that arise in the mean-field descriptions of two widely known network dynamical systems, the SIS epidemic and the adaptive voter model. We derive conditions that any moment closure has to satisfy so that the corresponding closed systems exhibit the transcritical bifurcation that one expects in these systems coming from the stochastic particle model.",

We consider conservation laws with nonlocal velocity and show, for nonlocal weights of exponential type, that the unique solutions converge in a weak or strong sense (dependent on the regularity of the velocity) to the entropy solution of the local conservation law when the nonlocal weight approaches a Dirac distribution. To this end, we first establish a uniform total variation bound on the nonlocal velocity, which can be used to pass to the limit in the weak solution. For the required entropy admissibility, we use a tailored entropy-flux pair and take advantage of a well-known result that a single strictly convex entropy-flux pair is sufficient for uniqueness, given some additional constraints on the velocity. For general weights, we show that the monotonicity of the initial datum is preserved over time, which enables us to prove convergence to the local entropy solution for rather general kernels if the initial datum is monotone. This case covers the archetypes of local conservation laws: shock waves and rarefactions. These results suggest that a “nonlocal in the velocity” approximation might be better suited to approximating local conservation laws than a nonlocal in the solution approximation, in which such monotonicity only holds for specific velocities.",

Based on lubrication approximation and thin air-foil theory, this problem is reduced to an integro-differential equation. The small-amplitude analysis is carried out to obtain two analytical solutions up to the second order. Numerical computation shows there exist two distinct primary bifurcation branches starting from infinitesimal waves, which approach solitary wave configuration in the long-wave limit when the values of physical parameters are above certain thresholds. New families of solutions manifest themselves either as secondary bifurcation occurring on primary branches or as isolated solution branches.

This manuscript presents an analytic solution to a generalization of the Wiener–Hopf equation in two variables and with three unknown functions. This equation arises in many applications, for example, when solving the discrete Helmholtz equation associated with scattering on a domain with perpendicular boundary. The traditional Wiener–Hopf method is suitable for problems involving boundary data on co-linear semi-infinite intervals, not for boundaries at an angle. This significant extension will enable the analytical solution to a new class of problems with more boundary configurations. Progress is made by defining an underlining manifold that links the two variables. This allows one to meromorphically continue the unknown functions on this manifold and formulate a jump condition. As a result the problem is fully solvable in terms of Cauchy-type integrals, which is surprising since this is not always possible for this type of functional equation.",

A weakly nonlinear stability analysis of isothermal Poiseuille flow in a fluid overlying porous domain is proposed and investigated in this article. The nonlinear interactions are studied by imposing finite amplitude disturbances to the classical model deliberated in Chang, Chen, and Straughan [J. Fluid Mech., 564 (2006), pp. 287–303]. The order parameter theory is used to ascertain the cubic Landau equation, and the regimes of instability for the bifurcations are determined henceforth. The well-established controlling parameters viz. the depth ratio [math] depth of fluid domain/depth of porous domain), the Beavers–Joseph constant [math], and the Darcy number [math] are inquired upon for the bifurcation phenomena. The imposed finite amplitude disturbances are viewed for bifurcations along the neutral stability curves and away from the critical point as a function of the wave number [math] and the Reynolds number [math]. The even-fluid-layer (porous) mode along the neutral stability curves correlates to the subcritical (supercritical) bifurcation phenomena. On perceiving the bifurcations as a function of [math] and [math] by moving away from the bifurcation/critical point, subcritical bifurcation is observed for increasing [math] and decreasing [math]. In contrast to only fluid flow through a channel, it is found that the inclusion of porous domain aids in the early appearance of subcritical bifurcation when [math]. A considerable difference between the computed skin friction coefficient for the base and the distorted state is observed for small (large) values of [math]. In addition, an intrinsic relation among the mode of instability, bifurcation phenomena, and secondary flow pattern is also observed.",

This paper shows that there exist Reed–Solomon (RS) codes, over exponentially large finite fields in the code length, that are combinatorially list-decodable well beyond the Johnson radius, in fact almost achieving the list-decoding capacity. In particular, we show that for any [math] there exist RS codes with rate [math] that are list-decodable from radius of [math]. We generalize this result to list-recovery, showing that there exist [math]-list-recoverable RS codes with rate [math]. Along the way we use our techniques to give a new proof of a result of Blackburn on optimal linear perfect hash matrices, and strengthen it to obtain a construction of strongly perfect hash matrices. To derive the results in this paper we show a surprising connection of the above problems to graph theory, and in particular to the tree packing theorem of Nash-Williams and Tutte. We also state a new conjecture that generalizes the tree packing theorem to hypergraphs and show that if this conjecture holds, then there would exist RS codes that are optimally (nonasymptotically) list-decodable.",

A graph whose edges only appear at certain points in time is called a temporal graph (among other names). Such a graph is temporally connected if each ordered pair of vertices is connected by a path which traverses edges in chronological order (i.e., a temporal path). In this paper, we consider a simple model of random temporal graph, obtained from an Erdős–Rényi random graph, [math], by considering a random permutation [math] of the edges and interpreting the ranks in [math] as presence times. We give a thorough study of the temporal connectivity of such graphs and derive implications for the existence of several kinds of sparse spanners. It turns out that temporal reachability in this model exhibits a su…",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 53, Issue 2, Page 315-345, April 2024. \n Abstract. We consider the problem of embedding a subset of [math] into a low-dimensional Hamming cube in an almost isometric way. We construct a simple, data-oblivious, and computationally efficient map that achieves this task with high probability; we first apply a specific structured random matrix, which we call the double circulant matrix; using that a matrix requires linear storage and matrix-vector multiplication that can be performed in near-linear time. We then binarize each vector by comparing each of its entries to a random threshold, selected uniformly at random from a well-chosen interval. We estimate the number of bits required for this encoding scheme in terms of two natural geometric complexity parameters of the set: its Euclidean covering numbers and its localized Gaussian complexity. The estimate we derive turns out to be the best that one can hope for, up to logarithmic terms. The key to the proof is a phenomenon of independent interest: we show that the double circulant matrix mimics the behavior of the Gaussian matrix in two important ways. First, it maps an arbitrary set in [math] into a set of well-spread vectors. Second, it yields a fast near-isometric embedding of any finite subset of [math] into [math]. This embedding achieves the same dimension reduction as the Gaussian matrix in near-linear time, under an optimal condition—up to logarithmic factors—on the number of points to be embedded. This improves a well-known construction due to Ailon and Chazelle.",

We define and study reachability preservers, a graph-theoretic primitive that has been implicit in prior work on network design. Given a directed graph [math] and a set of demand pairs [math], a reachability preserver is a sparse subgraph [math] that preserves reachability between all demand pairs Our first contribution is a series of extremal bounds on the size of reachability preservers. Our main result states that, for an [math]-node graph and demand pairs of the form [math] for a small node subset [math], there is always a reachability preserver on [math] edges. We additionally give a lower bound construction demonstrating that this upper bound characterizes the settings in which [math] size reachability preservers are generally possible, in a large range of parameters. The second contribution of this paper is a new connection between extremal graph sparsification results and classical Steiner Network Design problems. Surprisingly, prior to this work, the osmosis of techniques between these two fields had been superficial. This allows us to improve the state of the art approximation algorithms for the most basic Steiner-type problem in directed graphs from the [math] of Chlamtáč et al. [Approximating spanners and directed steiner forest: Upper and lower bounds, in Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, SIAM, Philadelphia, 2017, pp. 534–553] to [math].",

We study the problem of approximating the distances in an undirected weighted graph [math] by the distances in trees based on the notion of stretch. Focusing on decentralized models of computation such as the [math], [math], and semi-streaming models, our main results are as follows: (1) We develop a simple randomized algorithm that constructs a spanning tree such that the expected stretch of every edge is [math], where [math] is the number of nodes in [math].

The Kneser graph [math] is defined for integers [math] and [math] with [math] as the graph whose vertices are all the [math]-subsets of [math] where two such sets are adjacent if they are disjoint. The Schrijver graph [math] is defined as the subgraph of [math] induced by the collection of all [math]-subsets of [math] that do not include two consecutive elements modulo [math]. It is known that the chromatic number of both [math] and [math] is [math]. In the computational Kneser and Schrijver problems, we are given access to a coloring with [math] colors of the vertices of [math] and [math], respectively, and the goal is to find a monochromatic edge. We prove that the problems admit randomized algorithms with running time [math], hence they are fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the parameter [math]. The analysis involves structural results on intersecting families and on induced subgraphs of Kneser and Schrijver graphs. We also study the Agreeable-Set problem of assigning a small subset of a set of [math] items to a group of [math] agents, so that all agents value the subset at least as much as its complement. As an application of our algorithm for the Kneser problem, we obtain a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for the Agreeable-Set problem for instances with [math]. We further show that the Agreeable-Set problem is at least as hard as a variant of the Kneser problem with extended access to the input coloring.",

We study the computational complexity of the problem [math] of counting [math]-vertex induced subgraphs of a graph [math] that satisfy a graph property [math]. Our main result establishes an exhaustive and explicit classification for all hereditary properties, including tight conditional lower bounds under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH): If a hereditary property [math] is true for all graphs, or if it is true only for finitely many graphs, then [math] is solvable in polynomial time. Otherwise, [math] is [math]-complete when parameterized by [math], and, assuming ETH, it cannot be solved in time [math] for any function [math]. This classification features a wide range of properties for which the corresponding detection problem (as classified by Khot and Raman [Theoret. Comput. Sci., 289 (2002), pp. 997–1008]) is tractable but counting is hard. Moreover, even for properties which are already intractable in their decision version, our results yield significantly stronger lower bounds for the counting problem. As an additional result, we also present an exhaustive and explicit parameterized complexity classification for all properties that are invariant under homomorphic equivalence. By covering one of the most natural and general notions of closure, namely, closure under vertex-deletion (hereditary), we generalize some of the earlier results on this problem. For instance, our results fully subsume and strengthen the existing classification of [math] for monotone (subgraph-closed) properties due to Roth, Schmitt, and Wellnitz [SIAM J. Comput., (2022), pp. FOCS20-139–FOCS20-174].",
