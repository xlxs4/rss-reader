An important and growing effect that needs careful attention, especially when heterogeneous data sources are combined, is that of structured missingness, where data values are missing not at random, but with a specific structure.",

The algorithm is based on a two-stage approach similar to the one proposed by Lai and Mckenzie (SIAM J Math Data Sci 2:368–395, 2020). However, under a weaker assumption and with less computational complexity, our algorithms are shown to be able to find a desired cluster with high probability. The “one cluster at a time\" feature of our method distinguishes it from other global clustering methods.

In order to compensate weak singularities of the solution near boundaries, regularities of both the fractional noise and the optimal control problem are analyzed in weighted Sobolev space. The spectral Petrov–Galerkin method is presented by employing truncated spectral expansion of the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) type noise, and error estimates are given based on the obtained regularity of the optimal control problem.

          "description": "Abstract\nThe primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm is popular in solving min-max problems which are being widely used in a variety of areas. To improve the applicability and efficiency of PDHG for different application scenarios, we focus on the preconditioned PDHG (PrePDHG) algorithm, which is a framework covering PDHG, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and other methods. We give the optimal convergence condition of PrePDHG in the sense that the key parameters in the condition can not be further improved, which fills the theoretical gap in the-state-of-art convergence results of PrePDHG, and obtain the ergodic and non-ergodic sublinear convergence rates of PrePDHG. The theoretical analysis is achieved by establishing the equivalence between PrePDHG and indefinite proximal ADMM. Besides, we discuss various choices of the proximal matrices in PrePDHG and derive some interesting results. For example, the convergence condition of diagonal PrePDHG is improved to be tight, the dual stepsize of the balanced augmented Lagrangian method can be enlarged to 4/3 from 1, and a balanced augmented Lagrangian method with symmetric Gauss-Seidel iterations is also explored. Numerical results on the matrix game, projection onto the Birkhoff polytope, earth mover’s distance, and CT reconstruction verify the effectiveness and superiority of PrePDHG.",

The goal of the network is to resolve the computational challenges of curse-of-dimensionality and multiple scales of the problem. We first show that a standard Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) fails to capture the multiscale nature of the problem, hence justifies the need to use Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Networks (APNNs). We show that not all classical AP formulations are directly fit for the neural network approach. We construct a micro-macro decomposition based neural network, and also build in a mass conservation mechanism into the loss function, in order to capture the dynamic and multiscale nature of the solutions. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this APNNs.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe consider the numerical solution of Poisson’s equation on structured grids using geometric multigrid with nonstandard coarse grids and coarse-level operators. We are motivated by the problem of developing high-order accurate numerical solvers for elliptic boundary value problems on complex geometry using overset grids. For flexibility in grid generation, we would like to consider lower-order accurate coarse-level approximations, and coarsening factors other than two. We show that second-order accurate coarse-level approximations are very effective for fourth- or sixth-order accurate fine-level finite-difference discretizations. We study the use of different Galerkin and non-Galerkin coarse-level operators. Using local Fourier analysis (LFA) we choose the smoothing parameter \n                      \n                      \\(\\omega \\)\n                      \n                     and the coarse-level operators to optimize the overall multigrid convergence rate. We show that the results based on LFA for periodic problems also hold for more general boundary conditions provided these are discretized using compatibility conditions. Numerical results for Poisson’s equation on a sample overset grid show that our multigrid solver is many times faster, and uses less memory, than selected Krylov solvers and an algebraic multigrid solver. We also study grid coarsening by a general factor and show that good convergence rates are retained for a range of coarsening factors around two. We ask the question of which coarsening factor leads to the most efficient multigrid algorithm.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper addresses a simple energy-based overset finite element method (EbO-FEM) to solve pseudo-static deformation problems consisting of overlapped meshes based on the domain composition method (DCM). This scheme is a non-iterative equation-based method for enforcing the continuity of the displacement field. Hence, the scheme consumes possible minimal computational costs for deformation problems with non-conforming overlapping meshes. The system’s total energy is augmented with continuity constraint energy (CCE) which is a function of the gaps in the displacement field between two overlapping regions. Subsequently, two conventional integration schemes, the Gauss-point projection, and the point-to-point projection, are utilized to discretize the CCE. It is confirmed that both schemes can yield accurate and unique solutions in the overlapped region of the finite element meshes. Further, we proposed a dimensionless relative penalty parameter (DRP). We found that DRP ranging between 1 to 10 is appropriate to robustly obtain accurate solutions for a wide range of scales, stiffness, and geometries, which is supported by three numerical simulations without increasing computational costs after assembling the global matrices and vectors.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe present the first implementation of the Active Flux method on adaptively refined Cartesian grids. The Active Flux method is a third order accurate finite volume method for hyperbolic conservation laws, which is based on the use of point values as well as cell average values of the conserved quantities. The resulting method has a compact stencil in space and time and good stability properties. The method is implemented as a new solver in ForestClaw, a software for parallel adaptive mesh refinement of patch-based solvers. On each Cartesian grid patch the single grid Active Flux method can be applied. The exchange of data between grid patches is organised via ghost cells. The local stencil in space and time and the availability of the point values that are used for the reconstruction, leads to an efficient implementation. The resulting method is third order accurate, conservative and allows the use of subcycling in time.",

To this aim, we first perform a comprehensive analysis on a general type of multistep schemes for FBSDEs, based on which we present new sufficient conditions on the coefficients such that the associated schemes are stable and enjoy certain order of consistency.

We investigate the global convergence properties and the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm with high probability.

          "description": "Abstract\nA high-order finite-volume scheme with anisotropic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is combined with a parallel inexact Newton method for the solution of steady compressible fluid flows governed by the Euler and Navier–Stokes equations on three-dimensional multi-block body-fitted hexahedral meshes. The proposed steady flow solution method combines a family of robust and accurate high-order central essentially non-oscillatory (CENO) spatial discretization schemes with both a scalable and efficient Newton–Krylov–Schwarz (NKS) algorithm and a block-based anisotropic AMR method. The CENO scheme is based on a hybrid solution reconstruction procedure that provides high-order accuracy in smooth regions (even for smooth extrema) and non-oscillatory transitions at discontinuities and makes use of a high-order representation of the mesh and a high-order treatment of boundary conditions. In the proposed Newton method, the resulting linear systems of equations are solved using the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) algorithm preconditioned by a domain-based additive Schwarz technique. The latter uses the domain decomposition provided by the block-based AMR scheme leading to a fully parallel implicit approach with an efficient scalability of the overall scheme. The anisotropic AMR method is based on a binary tree data structure and permits local anisotropic refinement of the grid in preferred directions as directed by appropriately specified physics-based refinement criteria. Numerical results are presented for a range of inviscid and viscous steady problems and the computational performance of the combined scheme is demonstrated and assessed.",

The challenges in two-dimensions are related to the Fourier analysis. Here, we perform it on two types of periodic triangular meshes varying the angle of the advection, and we combine all the results for a general stability analysis. Furthermore, we introduce additional high order viscosity to stabilize the discontinuities, in order to show how to use these methods for tests of practical interest. All the theoretical results are thoroughly validated numerically both on linear and non-linear problems, and error-CPU time curves are provided. Our final conclusions suggest that Cubature elements combined with SSPRK and OSS stabilization is the most promising combination.",

In this paper, a two-scale approach for elastic shape optimization of fine-scale structures in additive manufacturing is investigated. To this end, a free material optimization is performed on the macro-scale using elasticity tensors in a set of microscopically realizable tensors. A database of these realizable tensors and their cost values is obtained with a shape and topology optimization on microscopic cells, working within a fixed set of elasticity tensors samples. This microscopic optimization takes into account manufacturability constraints via predefined material bridges to neighboring cells at the faces of the microscopic fundamental cell. For the actual additive manufacturing on a chosen fine-scale, a piecewise constant elasticity tensor ansatz on grid cells of a macroscopic mesh is applied. The macroscopic optimization is performed in an efficient online phase, whereas the associated cellwise optimal material patterns are retrieved from the database that was computed offline. For that, the set of admissible realizable elasticity tensors is parametrized using tensor product cubic B-splines over the unit square matching the precomputed samples. This representation is then efficiently used in an interior point method for the free material optimization on the macro-scale.",

When waves propagate through a complex medium like the turbulent atmosphere the wave field becomes incoherent and the wave intensity forms a complex speckle pattern. In this paper we study a speckle memory effect in the frequency domain and some of its consequences. This effect means that certain properties of the speckle pattern produced by wave transmission through a randomly scattering medium is preserved when shifting the frequency of the illumination. The speckle memory effect is characterized via a detailed novel analysis of the fourth-order moment of the random paraxial Green’s function at four different frequencies. We arrive at a precise characterization of the frequency memory effect and what governs the strength of the memory. As an application we quantify the statistical stability of time-reversal wave refocusing through a randomly scattering medium in the paraxial or beam regime. Time reversal refers to the situation when a transmitted wave field is recorded on a time-reversal mirror then time reversed and sent back into the complex medium. The re-emitted wave field then refocuses at the original source point. We compute the mean of the refocused wave and identify a novel quantitative description of its variance in terms of the radius of the time-reversal mirror, the size of its elements, the source bandwidth, and the statistics of the random medium fluctuations.",

We present a data-driven point of view for rare events, which represent conformational transitions in biochemical reactions modeled by overdamped Langevin dynamics on manifolds in high dimensions. We first reinterpret the transition state theory and the transition path theory from the optimal control viewpoint. Given a point cloud probing the manifold, we construct a discrete Markov chain with a [math]-matrix computed from an approximated Voronoi tesselation via the point cloud. We use this [math]-matrix to compute a discrete committor function whose level set automatically orders the point cloud. Then based on the committor function, an optimally controlled random walk on point clouds is constructed and utilized to efficiently sample transition paths, which become an almost sure event in [math] time instead of a rare event in the original reaction dynamics. To compute the mean transition path efficiently, a local averaging algorithm based on the optimally controlled random walk is developed, which adapts the finite temperature string method to the controlled Monte Carlo samples. Numerical examples on sphere/torus including a conformational transition for the alanine dipeptide in vacuum are conducted to illustrate the data-driven solver for the transition path theory on point clouds. The mean transition path obtained via the controlled Monte Carlo simulations highly coincides with the computed dominant transition path in the transition path theory.",

The goal of this work is to introduce a new online data driven modeling solution for tracking the dynamics of systems, the behavior of which is governed by (nonlinear) partial differential equations (PDEs). In order to reach this goal, this paper introduces a recursive algorithm for black box time varying model identification along with an online algorithm for reducing the order of the identified model. The resulting system model is a linear time varying low order state space representation usable, e.g., for controller design or prediction. The model reduction step relies on the recursive determination of the orthonormal basis of a specific data based proper orthogonal decomposition. The system identification procedure is initialized with the dynamic mode decomposition with control and updated recursively via the introduction of a specific recursive least squares algorithm. In both steps, a forgetting factor is used to focus on the most recent variations of the system. As case studies, a linear heat diffusion equation with a time varying diffusion parameter is first considered. The Burgers equation, a nonlinear hyperbolic PDE, is then utilized to assess the introduced methods applicability with nonlinear systems. Identification results based on simulation show the high accuracy of this new approach.",

This paper presents a framework to perform bifurcation analysis in laboratory experiments or simulations. We employ control-based continuation to study the dynamics of a macroscopic variable of a microscopically defined model, exploring the potential viability of the underlying feedback control techniques in an experiment. In contrast to previous experimental studies that used iterative root-finding methods on the feedback control targets, we propose a feedback control law that is inherently noninvasive. That is, the control discovers the location of equilibria and stabilizes them simultaneously. We call the proposed control zero-in-equilibrium feedback control and we prove that it is able to stabilize branches of equilibria, except at singularities of codimension [math], where [math] is the number of state space dimensions the feedback can depend on. We apply the method to a simulated evacuation scenario where pedestrians have to reach an exit after maneuvering left or right around an obstacle. The scenario shows a hysteresis phenomenon with bistability and tipping between two possible steady pedestrian flows in microscopic simulations. We demonstrate for the evacuation scenario that the proposed control law is able to uniformly discover and stabilize steady flows along the entire branch, including points where other noninvasive approaches to feedback control become singular.",

We study the paraxial wave equation with a randomly perturbed index of refraction, which can model the propagation of a wave beam in a turbulent medium. The random perturbation is a stationary and isotropic process with a general form of the covariance that may or may not be integrable. We focus attention mostly on the nonintegrable case, which corresponds to a random perturbation with long-range correlations, that is, relevant for propagation through a cloudy turbulent atmosphere. The analysis is carried out in a high-frequency regime where the forward scattering approximation holds. It reveals that the randomization of the wave field is multiscale: The travel time of the wave front is randomized at short distances of propagation, and it can be described by a fractional Brownian motion. The wave field observed in the random travel time frame is affected by the random perturbations at long distances, and it is described by a Schrödinger-type equation driven by a standard Brownian field. We use these results to quantify how scattering leads to decorrelation of the spatial and spectral components of the wave field and to a deformation of the pulse emitted by the source. These are important questions for applications, such as imaging and free space communications with pulsed laser beams through a turbulent atmosphere. We also compare the results with those used in the optics literature, which are based on the Kolmogorov model of turbulence. We show explicitly that the commonly used approximations for the decorrelation of spatial and spectral components are appropriate for the Kolmogorov model but fail for models with long-range correlations.",

The formulation is devised for an elastic response of generally arbitrary shape, and permits one to compute the propagation wave velocity without solving the equation of motion, thus providing a unified theoretical framework for a large class of response functions, linear or nonlinear, smooth or nonsmooth. The general solution is then applied to the cases of a general polynomial substrate, a bilinear substrate, a bilinear substrate with a cubic correction, and a negative linear stiffness substrate, all of them falling within the realm of nonsmooth systems when a piecewise continuous stiffness is chosen; in the second one, we recover results present in the literature and obtained by employing a method based on matching conditions, which are spared in the approach used in this paper.

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 52, Issue 1, Page 67-81, February 2023. \n Abstract. Let [math] be a family of sets in some metric space. In the [math] -chasing problem, an online algorithm observes a request sequence of sets in [math] and responds (online) by giving a sequence of points in these sets. The movement cost is the distance between consecutive such points. The competitive ratio is the worst case ratio (over request sequences) between the total movement of the online algorithm and the smallest movement one could have achieved by knowing in advance the request sequence. The family [math] is said to be chaseable if there exists an online algorithm with finite competitive ratio. In 1991, Linial and Friedman conjectured that the family of convex sets in Euclidean space is chaseable. We prove this conjecture.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 52, Issue 1, Page 38-66, February 2023. \n Abstract. Submodular function minimization (SFM) and matroid intersection are fundamental discrete optimization problems with applications in many fields. It is well known that both of these can be solved making [math] queries to a relevant oracle (evaluation oracle for SFM and rank oracle for matroid intersection), where [math] denotes the universe size. However, all known polynomial query algorithms are highly adaptive, requiring at least [math] rounds of querying the oracle. A natural question is whether these can be efficiently solved in a highly parallel manner, namely, with [math] queries using only polylogarithmic rounds of adaptivity. An important step towards understanding the adaptivity needed for efficient parallel SFM was taken recently in the work of Balkanski and Singer who showed that any SFM algorithm making [math] queries necessarily requires [math] rounds. This left open the possibility of efficient SFM algorithms in polylogarithmic rounds. For matroid intersection, even the possibility of a constant round, [math] query algorithm was not hitherto ruled out. In this work, we prove that any, possibly randomized, algorithm for submodular function minimization or matroid intersection making [math] queries requires (Throughout the paper, we use the usual convention of using [math] to denote [math] and using [math] to denote [math] for some unspecified constant [math]) [math] rounds of adaptivity. In fact, we show a polynomial lower bound on the number of rounds of adaptivity even for algorithms that make at most [math] queries for any constant [math]. Therefore, even though SFM and matroid intersection are efficiently solvable, they are not highly parallelizable in the oracle model.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 52, Issue 1, Page 1-37, February 2023. \n Abstract. We propose a new algorithm for Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problems (PCSPs). It is a combination of the Constraint Basic LP relaxation and the Affine IP relaxation (CLAP). We give a characterization of the power of CLAP in terms of a minion homomorphism. Using this characterization, we identify a certain weak notion of symmetry which, if satisfied by infinitely many polymorphisms of PCSPs, guarantees tractability. We demonstrate that there are PCSPs solved by CLAP that are not solved by any of the existing algorithms for PCSPs; in particular, not by the [math] algorithm of Brakensiek et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 49 (2020), pp. 1232--1248] and not by a reduction to tractable finite-domain CSPs.",
