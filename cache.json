The aim of this work is to provide a stable and robust numerical method for a wide range of physical and numerical parameters.

          "description": "Abstract\nOur recent work (Kang and Wang in J Sci Comput 82:1–33, 2020) performed a complete asymptotic analysis and proposed a modified Filon-type method for a class of oscillatory infinite Bessel transform with a general oscillator. In this paper, we present and analyze a different method by converting the integration path to the complex plane for this class of oscillatory infinite Bessel transform. In particular, we establish a series of new quadrature rules for this transform and carry out rigorous analysis, including the cases that the oscillator g(x) has either zeros or stationary points. The error analysis shows the advantages that this approach exhibits high asymptotic order, and the accuracy improves significantly as either the frequency \n                      \n                      \\(\\omega \\)\n                      \n                     or the number of nodes n increases.

          "description": "Abstract\nWe propose a novel use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) (i) to make predictions in time (PredGAN) and (ii) to assimilate measurements (DA-PredGAN). In the latter case, we take advantage of the natural adjoint-like properties of generative models and the ability to simulate forwards and backwards in time. GANs have received much attention recently, after achieving excellent results for their generation of realistic-looking images. We wish to explore how this property translates to new applications in computational modelling and to exploit the adjoint-like properties for efficient data assimilation. We apply these methods to a compartmental model in epidemiology that is able to model space and time variations, and that mimics the spread of COVID-19 in an idealised town. To do this, the GAN is set within a reduced-order model, which uses a low-dimensional space for the spatial distribution of the simulation states. Then the GAN learns the evolution of the low-dimensional states over time. The results show that the proposed methods can accurately predict the evolution of the high-fidelity numerical simulation, and can efficiently assimilate observed data and determine the corresponding model parameters.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we present a pressure-based semi-implicit numerical scheme for a first order hyperbolic formulation of compressible two-phase flow with surface tension and viscosity. The numerical method addresses several complexities presented by the PDE system in consideration: (i) The presence of involution constraints of curl type in the governing equations requires explicit enforcement of the zero-curl property of certain vector fields (an interface field and a distortion field); the problem is solved by adopting a set of compatible discrete curl and gradient operators on a staggered grid, allowing to preserve the Schwarz identity of cross-derivatives exactly at the discrete level. (ii) Since the complexity of the studied PDE system does not allow the explicit computation of its exact eigenvalues, reliable and precise analytical estimates are provided. (iii) The evolution equations feature highly nonlinear stiff algebraic source terms which are used for the description of viscous interactions as emergent behaviour of an elasto-plastic solid in the stiff strain relaxation limit; such source terms are reliably integrated with a novel and very efficient semi-analytical technique proposed for the first time in this paper. (iv) In the low-Mach number regime, standard explicit density-based Godunov-type schemes lose efficiency and accuracy; the issue is addressed by means of a simple semi-implicit, pressure-based, split treatment of acoustic and non-acoustic waves, again using staggered grids that recover the implicit solution for a single scalar field (the pressure) through a sequence of symmetric-positive definite linear systems that can be efficiently solved via the conjugate gradient method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nMany optimization problems arising from machine learning applications can be cast as the minimization of the sum of two functions: the first one typically represents the expected risk, and in practice it is replaced by the empirical risk, and the other one imposes a priori information on the solution. Since in general the first term is differentiable and the second one is convex, proximal gradient methods are very well suited to face such optimization problems. However, when dealing with large-scale machine learning issues, the computation of the full gradient of the differentiable term can be prohibitively expensive by making these algorithms unsuitable. For this reason, proximal stochastic gradient methods have been extensively studied in the optimization area in the last decade…",

          "description": "Abstract\nA posteriori upper and lower bounds are derived for the linear finite element method (FEM) for the Helmholtz equation with large wavenumber. It is proved rigorously that the standard residual type error estimator seriously underestimates the true error of the FE solution for the mesh size h in the preasymptotic regime, which is first observed by Babuška et al. (Int J Numer Methods Eng 40:3443–3462, 1997) for a one dimensional problem. By establishing an equivalence relationship between the error estimators for the FE solution and the corresponding elliptic projection of the exact solution, an adaptive algorithm is proposed and its convergence and quasi-optimality are proved under the condition that \n                      \n                      \\(k^3h_0^{1+\\alpha }\\)\n                      \n                     is sufficiently small, where k is the wavenumber, \n                      \n                      \\(h_0\\)\n                      \n                     is the initial mesh size, and \n                      \n                      \\(\\frac{1}{2}<\\alpha \\le 1\\)\n                      \n                     is a regularity constant depending on the maximum reentrant angle of the domain. Numerical tests are given to verify the theoretical findings and to show that the adaptive continuous interior penalty finite element method (CIP-FEM) with appropriately selected penalty parameters can greatly reduce the pollution error and hence the residual type error estimator for this CIP-FEM is reliable and efficient even in the preasymptotic regime.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe problem of blind ptychography is to determine the specimen object and the scanning probe simultaneously from diffraction data. By formulating the problem as a nonconvex optimization, we propose linearized alternating direction method of multipliers (LADMM) to effectively solve the blind ptychography problem. Different from the iterative ptychographic engines (including ePIE, rPIE and other variants), all of the diffraction patterns are simultaneously exploited in our optimization based approach to address the ill-posedness of the problem. Compared to the existing ADMM-type algorithm in the literature (Chang et al. in SIAM J Imaging Sci 12(1):153–185, 2019), ours is based on a new splitting form for the bilinear term, which enables closed-form solutions for each subproblem. Convergence to stationary point of the considered optimization is provided under certain assumptions. It is observed that the performance of ADMM-type method highly depends on the penalty parameter. Thus LADMM with adaptive penalty parameter is developed to prioritize the reconstruction performance and have empirical convergence guarantee. With numerical comparison to other competitive algorithms, our proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art ones on simulated and experimental data, especially for the only limited available diffraction data case, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe develop a simple and efficient dimension splitting method for solving time dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) on multiple space dimensional irregular domains using a one dimensional kernel-free boundary integral (KFBI) method. The proposed method extends the alternating direction implicit methods and locally one dimensional methods to more general cases involving complex geometry. The KFBI method is a potential theory based Cartesian grid method, which works as an improvement of conventional boundary integral methods. In the KFBI method, boundary or volume integrals are evaluated by solving equivalent interface problems without using any analytic expression of Green’s functions. The one dimensional interface problems after dimension splitting are solved by finite difference method. The resulting linear systems are tri-diagonal and efficiently solved by the Thomas algorithm. The one dimensional kernel-free boundary integral method is rigorously proved to have second-order convergence rate in the maximum norm. Multiple numerical examples, including different types of PDEs and a free boundary problem, are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. Numerical results show that the proposed method is efficient and achieves overall second order accuracy.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we extend the positivity-preserving, entropy stable first-order scheme developed for the one-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes equations in Upperman et al. (J Comput Phys 466, 2022) to three spatial dimensions. The new first-order scheme is provably entropy stable, design-order accurate for smooth solutions, and guarantees the pointwise positivity of thermodynamic variables for 3-D compressible viscous flows. Similar to the 1-D counterpart, the proposed scheme for the 3-D Navier–Stokes equations is discretized on Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto grids used for high-order spectral collocation methods. The positivity of density is achieved by adding an artificial dissipation in the form of the first-order Brenner–Navier–Stokes diffusion operator. Another distinctive feature of the proposed scheme is that the Navier–Stokes viscous terms are discretized by high-order spectral collocation summation-by-parts operators. To eliminate time step stiffness caused by the high-order approximation of the viscous terms and the temperature positivity constraint, the velocity and temperature limiters developed for the 1-D compressible Navier–Stokes equations in Upperman et al. (J. Comput. Phys., 466, 2022) are generalized to three spatial dimensions. These limiters bound the magnitude of velocity and temperature gradients and preserve the entropy stability and positivity properties of the baseline scheme. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate design-order accuracy and positivity-preserving properties of the new first-order scheme for 2-D and 3-D inviscid and viscous flows with strong shocks and contact discontinuities.",

While a common trend in disease modeling is to develop models of increasing complexity, it was recently pointed out that outbreaks appear remarkably simple when viewed in the incidence vs. cumulative cases (ICC) plane. This article details the theory behind this phenomenon by analyzing the stochastic Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model in the cumulative cases domain. We prove that the Markov chain associated with this model reduces, in the ICC plane, to a pure birth chain for the cumulative number of cases, whose limit leads to an independent increments Gaussian process that fluctuates about a deterministic ICC curve. We calculate the associated variance and quantify the additional variability due to estimating incidence over a finite period of time. We also illustrate the universality brought forth by the ICC concept on real-world data for Influenza A and for the COVID-19 outbreak in Arizona.",

Our object characterization builds on the generalized polarizability tensor (GPT) object characterization concept and provides an alternative to the contracted GPT. We call the new characterizations harmonic GPTs (HGPTs) as their coefficients correspond to products of harmonic polynomials. Then, we show that the number of independent coefficients of HGPTs needed to characterize objects can be significantly reduced by considering the symmetry group of the object and propose a systematic approach for determining the subspace of symmetric harmonic polynomials that is fixed by the group and its dimension.

Its quantitative understanding is highly relevant for the treatment of various diseases, including blood cancers. White blood cells (WBCs) originate from the so-called hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population. HSCs give rise to immature WBCs that divide and further differentiate into mature cells. It is still a matter of debate whether cell differentiation resembles a discrete or a continuous process. We propose a novel continuous integral model (CIM) to describe WBC production. In agreement with recent experimental results, the maturity level of cells is described by a one-dimensional continuous variable. The process of maturation is modeled by an integral term that accounts for the influx of cells of maturity level [math] from the differentiation of cells with lower maturity levels. In the model, cell proliferation and differentiation are controlled by a feedback signal which is a function of the mature cell population. We investigate the relationships between the proposed CIM, the multicompartment ordinary differential equations model introduced in [A. Marciniak-Czochra et al., Stem Cells Dev., 18 (2009), pp. 377–385] which treats differentiation as a discrete process, and the partial differential equations model of transport type studied by Doumic et al. [SIAM J. Appl. Math., 71 (2011), pp. 1918–1940] which describes differentiation as a continuous process. We show that both models can be derived from the CIM and we perform numerical simulations to compare them qualitatively.",

Load balancing is a well-studied problem, with balls-in-bins being the primary framework. The greedy algorithm [math] of Azar et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 29 (1999), pp. 180–200] places each ball by probing [math] random bins and placing the ball in the least loaded of them. With high probability, the maximum load under [math] is exponentially lower than the result when balls are placed uniformly randomly. Vöcking [J. ACM, 50 (2003), pp. 568–589] showed that a slightly asymmetric variant, [math], provides a further significant improvement. However, this improvement comes at the additional computational cost of imposing structure on the bins. Here, we present a fully decentralized and easy-to-implement algorithm called [math] that combines the simplicity of [math] and the improved balance of [math]. The key idea in [math] is to probe until a different bin size from the first observation is located and then place the ball. Although the number of probes could be quite large for some of the balls, we show that [math] requires only at most [math] probes on average per ball (in both the standard and the heavily loaded settings). Thus the number of probes is no greater than that of either [math] or [math]. More importantly, we show that [math] closely matches the improved maximum load ensured by [math] in both the standard and heavily loaded settings. We further provide a tight lower bound on the maximum load up to [math] terms. We additionally give experimental data that [math] is indeed as good as [math], if not better, in practice.",

Given a planar graph [math] and an integer [math], it is possible in polynomial time to randomly sample a subset [math] of vertices of [math] with the following properties: [math] induces a subgraph of [math] of treewidth [math], and for every connected subgraph [math] of [math] on at most [math] vertices, the probability that [math] covers the whole vertex set of [math] is at least [math], where [math] is the number of vertices of [math]. Together with standard dynamic programming techniques for graphs of bounded treewidth, this result gives a versatile technique for obtaining (randomized) subexponential-time parameterized algorithms for problems on planar graphs, usually with running time bound [math]. The technique can be applied to problems expressible as searching for a small, connected pattern with a prescribed property in a large host graph; examples of such problems include Directed [math]-Path, Weighted [math]-Path, Vertex Cover Local Search, and Subgraph Isomorphism, among others. Up to this point, it was open whether these problems could be solved in subexponential parameterized time on planar graphs, because they are not amenable to the classic technique of bidimensionality. Furthermore, all our results hold in fact on any class of graphs that exclude a fixed apex graph as a minor, in particular on graphs embeddable in any fixed surface.",

Graph sparsification underlies a large number of algorithms, ranging from approximation algorithms for cut problems to solvers for linear systems in the graph Laplacian. In its strongest form, “spectral sparsification” reduces the number of edges to near-linear in the number of nodes, while approximately preserving the cut and spectral structure of the graph. In this work we demonstrate a polynomial quantum speedup for spectral sparsification and many of its applications. In particular, we give a quantum algorithm that, given a weighted graph with [math] nodes and [math] edges, outputs a classical description of an [math]-spectral sparsifier in sublinear time [math]. This contrasts with the optimal classical complexity [math]. We also prove that our quantum algorithm is optimal up to polylog-factors. The algorithm builds on a string of existing results on sparsification, graph spanners, quantum algorithms for shortest paths, and efficient constructions for [math]-wise independent random strings. Our algorithm implies a quantum speedup for solving Laplacian systems and for approximating a range of cut problems such as min cut and sparsest cut.",

We present a general framework for designing approximately revenue-optimal mechanisms for multi-item additive auctions, which applies to both truthful and nontruthful auctions. Given a (not necessarily truthful) single-item auction format [math] satisfying certain technical conditions, we run simultaneous item auctions augmented with a personalized entry fee for each bidder that must be paid before the auction can be accessed. These entry fees depend only on the prior distribution of bidder types and in particular are independent of realized bids. We bound the revenue of the resulting two-part tariff mechanism using a novel geometric technique that enables revenue guarantees for many common nontruthful auctions that previously had none. Our approach adapts and extends the duality framework of Cai, Devanur, and Weinberg [SIAM J. Comput., 50 (2021), pp. STOC16-160–STOC16-200] beyond truthful auctions. Our framework can be used with many common auction formats, such as simultaneous first-price, simultaneous second-price, and simultaneous all-pay auctions. Our results for first-price and all-pay are the first revenue guarantees of nontruthful mechanisms in multidimensional environments, addressing an open question in the literature [T. Roughgarden, V. Syrgkanis, and E. Tardos, J. Artificial Intelligence Res., 59 (2017), pp. 59–101]. If all-pay auctions are used, we prove that the resulting mechanism is also credible in the sense that the auctioneer cannot benefit by deviating from the stated mechanism after observing agent bids. This is the first static credible mechanism for multi-item additive auctions that achieves a constant factor of the optimal revenue. If second-price auctions are used, we obtain a truthful [math]-approximate mechanism with fixed entry fees that are amenable to tuning via online learning techniques.",

One of the central problems in algorithmic coding theory is to construct [math]-query LCCs and LDCs with minimal block length. Alas, state-of-the-art of such codes requires super-polynomial block length to admit [math]-query algorithms for local correction and decoding, despite much attention during the last two decades. The study of relaxed LCCs and LDCs, which allow the correction algorithm to abort (but not err) on a small fraction of the locations, provides a way to circumvent this barrier. This relaxation turned out to allow constant-query correcting and decoding algorithms for codes with polynomial block length. Focusing on local correction, Gur, Ramnarayan, and Rothblum [Proceedings of the 9th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference, ITCS’18, 2018, pp. 1–27] showed that there exist [math]-query relaxed LCCs that achieve nearly-quartic block length [math], for an arbitrarily small constant [math]. We construct an [math]-query relaxed LCC with nearly-linear block length [math], for an arbitrarily small constant [math]. This significantly narrows the gap between the lower bound which states that there are no [math]-query relaxed LCCs with block length [math]. In particular, our construction matches the parameters achieved by Ben-Sasson et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 36 (2006), pp. 889–974], who constructed relaxed LDCs with the same parameters. This resolves an open problem raised by Gur, Ramnarayan, and Rothblum [Proceedings of the 9th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference, ITCS’18, 2018, pp. 1–27].",
