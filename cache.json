          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose a conforming virtual element method based on an unfitted mesh to solve the elliptic interface problem in two dimensions. The intersecting points of the interface and the edges of triangles are considered as additional nodes of the mesh. Thus each interface triangle is regarded as a polygon with more than three vertices. On each interface polygon, we introduce a virtual element satisfying the interface conditions. On each non-interface triangle, we use the usual linear element. Based on a computable projection-like operator, we introduce our discrete scheme. Both the approximation and consistency errors are analyzed rigorously and all the hidden constants do not depend on how the interface intersects with the meshes. The error between the exact and discrete solution is shown to decrease linear with regard to the mesh size. Some numerical experiments are provided to verify the theoretical results.",

When the mesh grading parameter is appropriately chosen, we obtain quasioptimal error estimations in a balanced norm for piecewise bilinear elements, by using a weighted variational formulation of the problem introduced by N. Madden and M. Stynes, Calcolo 58(2) 2021. We also prove a supercloseness result, namely, that the difference between the finite element solution and the Lagrange interpolation of the exact solution, in the weighted balanced norm, is of higher order than the error itself.

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper new explicit integrators for numerical solution of stiff evolution equations are proposed. As shown by Bassenne, Fu and Mani in (J Comput Phys 424:109847, 2021), the action on the original vector field of the stiff equations of an appropriate time-accurate and highly-stable explicit (TASE) linear operator, allows us to use explicit Runge–Kutta (RK) schemes with these modified equations so that the resulting algorithm becomes stable for the original stiff equations. Here a new family of TASE operators is considered. The new operators, called Singly TASE, have the advantage over the TASE operators of Bassenne et al. that the action on the vector field depends on the powers of the inverse of only one matrix, which can be computationally more simple, without loosing stability properties. A complete study of the linear stability properties of k–stage, kth–order explicit RK schemes under the action of Singly TASE operators of the same order is carried out for \n                      \n                      \\(k \\le 4\\)\n                      \n                    . For orders two, three and four, particular schemes that are nearly strongly A–stable and therefore suitable for stiff problems are devised. Further, explicit RK schemes with orders three and four that can be implemented with only two storage locations under the action of Singly TASE operators of the same order are discussed. A particular implementation of the classical four–stage fourth–order RK scheme with two Singly TASE operators is presented. A set of numerical experiments has been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the new schemes by comparing with previous RKTASE and other established methods. The main conclusion is that the new integrators provide a very simple solver for stiff systems with good stability properties and avoids the difficulties of using implicit algorithms.",

          "description": "Abstract\nGetting an efficient neural network can be a very difficult task for engineers and researchers because of the huge number of hyperparameters to tune and their interconnections. To make the tuning step easier and more understandable, this work focuses on probably one of the most important leverage to improve Neural Networks efficiency: the optimizer. These recent years, a great number of algorithms have been developed but they need an accurate tuning to be efficient. To get rid of this long and experimental step, we are looking for generic and desirable properties for non-convex optimization. For this purpose, the optimizers are reinterpreted or analyzed as a discretization of a continuous dynamical system. This continuous framework offers many mathematical tools in order to interpret the sensitivity of the optimizer with respect to the initial guess such as Lyapunov stability. By enforcing the discrete decrease of Lyapunov functionals, new robust and efficient optimizers are designed. They also considerably simplify the tuning of hyperparameters (learning rate, momentum etc.). These Lyapunov based algorithms outperform several state of the art optimizers on different benchmarks of the literature. Drawing its inspiration from the numerical analysis of PDEs, this paper emphasizes the essential role of some hidden energy/entropy quantities for machine learning tasks.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we study least-squares finite element methods (LSFEM) for general second-order elliptic equations with nonconforming finite element approximations. The equation may be indefinite. For the two-field potential-flux div LSFEM with Crouzeix–Raviart (CR) element approximation, we present three proofs of the discrete solvability under the condition that mesh size is small enough. One of the proof is based on the coerciveness of the original bilinear form. The other two are based on the minimal assumption of the uniqueness of the solution of the second-order elliptic equation. A counterexample shows that div least-squares functional does not have norm equivalence in the sum space of \n                      \n                      \\(H^1\\)\n                      \n                     and CR finite element spaces. Thus it cannot be used as an a posteriori error estimator. Several versions of reliable and efficient error estimators are proposed for the method. We also propose a three-filed potential-flux-intensity div-curl least-squares method with general nonconforming finite element approximations. The norm equivalence in the abstract nonconforming piecewise \n                      \n                      \\(H^1\\)\n                      \n                    -space is established for the three-filed formulation on the minimal assumption of the uniqueness of the solution of the second-order elliptic equation. The three-filed div-curl nonconforming formulation thus has no restriction on the mesh size, and the least-squares functional can be used as the built-in a posteriori error estimator. Under some restrictive conditions, we also discuss a potential-flux div-curl least-squares method.",

For the maximal order bases, a new set of correction functions which result in stable schemes is found. However, for a range of orders it is shown that only a single correction function can be cast as a tensor-product. Subsequently, correction functions are identified using a generalised analytic framework that results in stable schemes for total order and approximate Euclidean order polynomial bases on quadrilaterals—which have not previously been explored in the context of flux reconstruction. It is shown that the approximate Euclidean order basis can provide similar numerical accuracy as the maximal order basis but with fewer points per element, and thus lower cost.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe aim of this work is to apply a semi-implicit (SI) strategy in an implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge–Kutta (RK) setting introduced in Boscarino et al. (J Sci Comput 68:975–1001, 2016) to a sequence of 1D time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) with high order spatial derivatives. This strategy gives a great flexibility to treat these equations, and allows the construction of simple linearly implicit schemes without any Newton’s iteration. Furthermore, the SI IMEX-RK schemes so designed does not need any severe time step restriction that usually one has using explicit methods for the stability, i.e. \n                      \n                      \\(\\Delta t = {\\mathcal {O}}(\\Delta t^k)\\)\n                      \n                     for the kth (\n                      \n                      \\(k \\ge 2\\)\n                      \n                    ) order PDEs.

          "description": "Abstract\nIn the current research, we analyze dissipation and dispersion characteristics of the most accurate two and three-stage Gauss–Legendre implicit Runge–Kutta (R-K) methods. These methods, known for their A-stability and high stage order, are observed to carry minimum dissipation error along with the highest possible dispersive order in their respective classes. Investigation reveals that these schemes are inherently optimized to carry low phase error only at small wavenumber. It is noticed that a unique scheme, although usually sought, might not be best across diverse temporal step sizes. As larger temporal step size is imperative in conjunction with implicit R-K methods for physical problems, we thoroughly investigate to derive a class of minimum dissipation and optimally low dispersion implicit R-K schemes. Schemes are obtained by cutting down amplification error and maximum reduction of weighted phase error, suggest better accuracy for relatively bigger and varied CFL numbers. A potentially generalizable algorithm is used to design stable implicit R-K methods. As the work focuses on two and three-stage schemes, a comprehensive comparison using numerical test cases document only modest gain in accuracy or efficiency over Gauss methods.",

          "description": "Abstract\nFor differential equations with multiple order spatial derivatives, there are some shortcomings by the classical high order compact (HOC) discretization. At least one of them is reducing the computational efficiency due to the multiple inverse manipulation of matrices. This motivates us to design a new kind of compact method what is called combined high order compact methods. The basic idea lying in this kind of method is to solve all the spatial derivatives simultaneously. Then, it is used to solve coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (CNLS) equations which contain both the first and second order derivatives. This scheme is not only more compact and accurate than standard HOC scheme and standard finite difference method with the same order, but also it can construct structure-preserving schemes. It preserves the symplectic structure and mass, and sometimes energy and momentum. Numerical experiments indicate that the new scheme can simulate the CNLS equations very accurately and efficiently. The mass and momentum are exactly preserved. The energy is preserved in some especially cases.",

We first propose a variational formulation and rigorously prove that it preserves two geometric structures of enclosed area conservation and perimeter decrease. Then the parametric finite element method is adopted to develop a semi-discrete scheme. Both the area conservation and perimeter decrease structure properties are strictly proven for the semi-discrete scheme by utilizing the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality and power mean inequality. On this basis, a fully discrete scheme is established by further taking the backward Euler method in the temporal direction and discretizing the unit normal vector appropriately. We give a rigorous proof that the scheme is structure-preserving at the discretized level.

We specifically consider the case where each data set is missing vital information, which prevents the accurate recovery of the individual images. Although some recent (variational) methods have demonstrated high-resolution image recovery based on jointly recovering sequential images, there remain robustness issues due to parameter tuning and restrictions on the type of sequential images. Here, we present a method based on hierarchical Bayesian learning for the joint recovery of sequential images that incorporates prior intra- and inter-image information. Our method restores the missing information in each image by “borrowing” it from the other images. More precisely, we couple sequential images by penalizing their pixel-wise difference. The corresponding penalty terms (one for each pixel and pair of subsequent images) are treated as weakly-informative random variables that favor small pixel-wise differences but allow occasional outliers. As a result, all of the individual reconstructions yield improved accuracy. Our method can be used for various data acquisitions and allows for uncertainty quantification. Some preliminary results indicate its potential use for sequential deblurring and magnetic resonance imaging.",

Fully resolving dynamics of materials with rapidly varying features involves expensive fine-scale computations which need to be conducted on macroscopic scales. The theory of homogenization provides an approach for deriving effective macroscopic equations which eliminates the small scales by exploiting scale separation. An accurate homogenized model avoids the computationally expensive task of numerically solving the underlying balance laws at a fine scale, thereby rendering a numerical solution of the balance laws more computationally tractable. In complex settings, homogenization only defines the constitutive model implicitly, and machine learning can be used to learn the constitutive model explicitly from localized fine-scale simulations. In the case of one-dimensional viscoelasticity, the linearity of the model allows for a complete analysis. We establish that the homogenized constitutive model may be approximated by a recurrent neural network that captures the memory. The memory is encapsulated in the evolution of an appropriate finite set of hidden variables, which are discovered through the learning process and dependent on the history of the strain. Simulations are presented which validate the theory. Guidance for the learning of more complex models, such as arise in plasticity, using similar techniques, is given.",

Optimal balance is a nonasymptotic numerical method for computing a point on an elliptic slow manifold for two-scale dynamical systems with strong gyroscopic forces. It works by solving a modified differential equation as a boundary value problem in time, where the nonlinear terms are adiabatically ramped up from zero to the fully nonlinear dynamics. A dedicated boundary value solver, however, is often not directly available. The most natural alternative is a nudging solver, where the problem is repeatedly solved forward and backward in time and the respective boundary conditions are restored whenever one of the temporal end points is visited. In this paper, we show quasi-convergence of this scheme in the sense that the termination residual of the nudging iteration is as small as the asymptotic error of the method itself, i.e., under appropriate assumptions exponentially small. This confirms that optimal balance in its nudging formulation is an effective algorithm. Further, it shows that the boundary value problem formulation of optimal balance is well posed up to at most a residual error as small as the asymptotic error of the method itself. The key step in our proof is a careful two-component Gronwall inequality.",

We develop a model for investigating the impact of rainstorm variability on the formation of banded vegetation patterns in dryland ecosystems. Water input, during rare rainstorms, is modeled as an instantaneous kick to the soil water. The redistribution, from surface water to soil moisture, accounts for the impact of vegetation on infiltration rate and downslope overland flow speed. These two positive feedbacks between water and biomass distributions act on the fast timescales of rain storms. During dry periods, a classic reaction-diffusion framework is used for the slow processes associated with soil water and biomass. This pulsed-precipitation model predicts that the preferred spacing of the vegetation bands is determined by the characteristic distance that a storm pulse of water travels overland before infiltrating into the soil. In this way, the vegetation pattern is determined by the fast ecohydrological processes and may be attuned with its dryland precipitation pattern. We demonstrate how this modeling framework, suited for stochastic rain inputs, can be used to investigate possible collapse of a dryland pattern-forming ecosystem under different precipitation patterns with identical low annual mean. Model simulations suggest, for instance, that shorter rainy seasons and greater variability in storm depth may both hasten ecosystem collapse.",

A reduced order modeling strategy is proposed that can accurately capture the behavior of strongly perturbed nonlinear dynamical systems, i.e., those that are subject to general, large magnitude inputs. In contrast to standard variational approaches which consider dynamics in the neighborhood of a single reference trajectory, the proposed methodology augments the dynamics with an additional variable that continuously selects from a family of reference trajectories in order to limit truncation errors that result from neglected nonlinear terms. Provided the reference trajectories contract sufficiently rapidly in some directions, a reduced order set of equations can be obtained by choosing an appropriate coordinate system. Direct numerical approaches for computation of the necessary terms of the associated reduced order equations are provided. Crucially, because the proposed reduction strategy does not require the existence of a persistent, stable fixed point or periodic orbit, it can be implemented in situations where external inputs cause the dynamics to transition through a bifurcation. Two examples with relevance to neural control are provided. In the first, the proposed reduction strategy allows for the formulation of a numerically tractable control problem to identify energy-optimal inputs that eliminate tonic firing in a neural model. In the second example, the proposed reduction framework accurately captures successive transitions between quiescence and tonic firing across the boundary of a saddle-node on invariant circle bifurcation.",

Because of the high dimensionality of reaction-diffusion systems on networks, exploration for the bifurcation properties of such systems has been far less thorough than their corresponding parabolic PDE systems. With the overcoming of this long-standing difficulty, we consider the steady state bifurcation for the general network-organized reaction-diffusion system and derive the algorithm of calculating the perturbation incorporated restricted system associated with the simple zero singularity, through seeking out the parameter dependent center manifolds belonging to the unique zero eigenvalue. Rigorous theoretical analysis for the third-order truncated restricted system shows that the complex underlying networks can trigger some bifurcation types differing from the usual supercritical and subcritical pitchfork bifurcations and so enrich the dynamical behaviors of reaction-diffusion process in networks. To illustrate the application for our obtained theoretical results, we conduct a strict steady state bifurcation analysis for a metapopulation epidemic system defined on four typical connected undirected underlying networks, and find that there exist some new multistability phenomena and hysteresis effects in the irregular small-word and scale-free lattice network.",

At the macroscopic scale, many important models of collective motion fall into the class of kinematic flows for which both velocity and diffusion terms depend only on particle density. When total particle numbers are fixed and finite, simulations of corresponding microscopic dynamics exhibit stochastic effects which can induce a variety of interesting behaviors not present in the large system limit. In this article we undertake a systematic examination of finite-size fluctuations in a general class of particle models whose statistics correspond to those of stochastic kinematic flows. Doing so, we are able to characterize phenomena including quasi-jams in models of traffic flow; stochastic pattern formation among spatially coupled oscillators; anomalous bulk subdiffusion in porous media; and travelling wave fluctuations in a model of bacterial swarming.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 52, Issue 3, Page 641-683, June 2023. \n Abstract. The chase procedure is a fundamental algorithmic tool in database theory with a variety of applications. A central problem concerning the chase procedure is uniform (a.k.a. all-instances) chase termination: for a given set of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs), is it the case that the chase terminates for every input database? In view of the fact that this problem is, in general, undecidable, it is natural to ask whether known well-behaved classes of TGDs ensure decidability. We focus on the main paradigms that led to robust TGD-based formalisms, namely guardedness and stickiness, that have been introduced in the context of knowledge-enriched databases. Although uniform chase termination is well understood for the oblivious version of the chase (2EXPTIME-complete for guarded, and PSPACE-complete for sticky TGDs), the more subtle case of the restricted (a.k.a. the standard) chase is rather unexplored. We show that uniform restricted chase termination under guarded single-head TGDs and sticky single-head TGDs is decidable in elementary time. In the case of guardedness, we provide a reduction to the satisfiability problem of monadic second-order logic over infinite trees of bounded degree, while for stickiness we provide a reduction to the emptiness problem of deterministic Büchi automata. Those reductions build on a series of technical results of independent interest related to the notion of fairness of the restricted chase, and the existence of critical databases that characterize nontermination of the restricted chase via databases of a certain form.",

In this paper we take a combinatorial approach to the problem of list-decoding, which allows us to determine the precise relation (up to the exact constant) between the decoding radius, list size, and code rate. We prove a generalized Singleton bound for a given list size, and conjecture that the bound is tight for most Reed–Solomon (RS) codes over large enough finite fields. We also show that the conjecture holds true for list sizes 2 and 3, and as a by product show that most RS codes with a rate of at least 1/9 are list-decodable beyond the Johnson radius. Last, we give the first explicit construction in the literature of such RS codes. The main tools used in the proof are a new type of linear dependency between codewords of a code that are contained in a small Hamming ball, and a surprising connection between list-decoding and the notion of cycle space in graph theory. Both of them are new, and may be of independent interest.",

The basic goal of survivable network design is to build a cheap network that maintains the connectivity between given sets of nodes despite the failure of a few edges/nodes. The connectivity augmentation problem ([math]) is arguably one of the most basic problems in this area: given a [math](-edge)-connected graph [math] and a set of extra edges (links), select a minimum cardinality subset [math] of links such that adding [math] to [math] increases its edge connectivity to [math]. Intuitively, one wants to make an existing network more reliable by augmenting it with extra edges. The best known approximation factor for this NP-hard problem is 2, and this can be achieved with multiple approaches (the first su…",
