          "description": "Abstract\nIn this article, we propose and analyze a fully coupled, nonlinear, and energy-stable virtual element method (VEM) for solving the coupled Poisson–Nernst–Planck (PNP) and Navier–Stokes (NS) equations. These equations model microfluidic and electrochemical systems that include the diffuse transport of charged species within incompressible fluids coupled through electrostatic forces. A mixed VEM is employed to discretize the NS equations whereas classical VEM in primal form is used to discretize the PNP equations. The stability, existence and uniqueness of solution of the associated VEM are proved by fixed point theory. The global mass conservation and electric energy decay of the scheme are also established. Also, we rigorously derive unconditionally optimal error estimates for both the electrostatic potential and ionic concentrations of PNP equations in the \n                      \n                      \\(\\textrm{L}^{2}\\)\n                      \n                     and \n                      \n                      \\(\\textrm{H}^{1}\\)\n                      \n                    -norms, as well as for the velocity and pressure of NS equations in the \n                      \n                      \\(\\textbf{L}^{2}\\)\n                      \n                    , \n                      \n                      \\(\\textbf{H}^1\\)\n                      \n                    - and \n                      \n                      \\(\\textrm{L}^{2}\\)\n                      \n                    -norms, respectively. Finally, several numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical analysis of convergence and to illustrate the satisfactory performance of the method in simulating the onset of electrokinetic instabilities in ionic fluids, and studying how they are influenced by different values of ion concentration and applied voltage.

The paper focuses on the theoretical analyses and computational efficiency of the proposed schemes, the Crank–Nicoloson scheme is proved to be unconditionally convergent and has maximum-norm boundness of numerical solutions. The exponential scalar auxiliary variable scheme is linearly implicit and decoupled, but lack of the maximum-norm boundness, also, the energy structure is modified. Subsequently, the efficient implementations of the proposed schemes are introduced in detail.

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a block mirror stochastic gradient method is developed to solve stochastic optimization problems involving convex and nonconvex cases, where the feasible set and the variables are treated as multiple blocks. The proposed method combines the features of the classic mirror descent stochastic method and the block coordinate gradient descent method. Acquiring the stochastic gradient information by stochastic oracles, our method updates all the blocks of variables in the Gauss–Seidel type. We establish the convergence for both convex and nonconvex cases. The analysis of our method is challenging because the typical unbiasedness assumption of stochastic gradient fails to hold in the Gauss–Seidel renewal type and requires more specific assumptions. The proposed algorithm is tested on the conditional value-at-risk problem and the stochastic LASSO problem to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe level-set method is widely used in expanding front simulations in numerous fields of computational research, such as computer graphics, physics, or microelectronics. In the latter, the level-set method is employed for topography simulations of semiconductor device fabrication processes, being driven by complicated physical and chemical models. These models tend to produce surfaces with critical points where accuracy is paramount. To efficiently increase the accuracy in regions neighboring these critical points, automatic hierarchical domain refinement is required, guided by robust feature detection. Feature detection has to be computationally efficient and sufficiently accurate to reliably detect the critical points. To that end, we present a fast parallel geometric feature detection algorithm for three-dimensional level-set functions. Our approach is based on two different, complementary curvature calculation methods of the zero level-set and an optimized feature detection parameter to detect features. For performance reasons, our algorithm can be in principal linked to different curvature calculation methods, however, as will be discussed, two particularly attractive options are available: (i) A novel extension of the standard curvature calculation method for level-set functions, and (ii) an often disregarded method for calculating the curvature due to its purported low numerical accuracy. We show, however, that the latter is still a viable option, and that our algorithm is able to reliably detect features on geometries stemming from complicated, practically relevant geometries. Our algorithm and findings are applicable to other fields of applications such as surface simplification.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) method is one of the most popular method for uncertainty quantification. Being essentially a spectral approach, the gPC method exhibits the spectral convergence rate which heavily depends on the regularity of the solution in the random space. Many regularity studies have been made for stochastic elliptic and parabolic equations while regularities studies of stochastic hyperbolic equations has long been infeasible due to its intrinsic difficulties. In this paper, we investigate the impact of uncertainty on the time-dependent radiative transfer equation (RTE) with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions, which sits somewhere between hyperbolic and parabolic equations. We theoretically prove the a-priori bound of the solution, its continuity with respect to the scattering coefficient, and its regularity in the random space. These studies can serve as a building block in understanding the influence of uncertainties in the passage from hyperbolic to parabolic equations. Moreover, we vigorously justify the validity of the gPC expansion ansatz based on the regularity study. Then the stochastic Galerkin method of the gPC approach is employed to discretize the random variable. We further conduct a delicate analysis to show the exponential decay rate of the gPC coefficients and establish the error estimates of the stochastic Galerkin approximation for both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional random space cases. Numerical tests are presented to verify our analytical results.",

          "description": "Abstract\nSince their introduction the Transformer architectures emerged as the dominating architectures for both natural language processing and, more recently, computer vision applications. An intrinsic limitation of this family of “fully-attentive” architectures arises from the computation of the dot-product attention, which grows both in memory consumption and number of operations as \n                      \n                      \\(O(n^2)\\)\n                      \n                     where n stands for the input sequence length, thus limiting the applications that require modeling very long sequences. Several approaches have been proposed so far in the literature to mitigate this issue, with varying degrees of success. Our idea takes inspiration from the world of lossy data compression (such as the JPEG algorithm) to derive an approximation of the attention module by leveraging the properties of the Discrete Cosine Transform. An extensive section of experiments shows that our method takes up less memory for the same performance, while also drastically reducing inference time. Moreover, we assume that the results of our research might serve as a starting point for a broader family of deep neural models with reduced memory footprint. The implementation will be made publicly available at https://github.com/cscribano/DCT-Former-Public.",

Accelerated first-order methods such as the fast iterative shrinkage–thresholding algorithm (FISTA) have proven effective for numerous large composite models. In this paper, we present a new variation of FISTA, to be called C-FISTA, which obtains global linear convergence for a broader class of composite models than many of the latest FISTA variants. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of C-FISTA through multiple numerical experiments on group Lasso, group logistic regression and geometric programming models. Furthermore, we utilize Fenchel duality to show C-FISTA can solve the dual of a finite sum convex optimization model.",

The method is directly applicable to mixed finite and virtual element methods, among other structure-preserving discretization techniques, and we present the extension to Darcy flow in fractured porous media.",

The algorithm is based on a two-stage approach similar to the one proposed by Lai and Mckenzie (SIAM J Math Data Sci 2:368–395, 2020). However, under a weaker assumption and with less computational complexity, our algorithms are shown to be able to find a desired cluster with high probability. The “one cluster at a time\" feature of our method distinguishes it from other global clustering methods. Numerical experiments are conducted on the synthetic data such as stochastic block model and real data such as MNIST, political blogs network, AT &T and YaleB human faces data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm is popular in solving min-max problems which are being widely used in a variety of areas. To improve the applicability and efficiency of PDHG for different application scenarios, we focus on the preconditioned PDHG (PrePDHG) algorithm, which is a framework covering PDHG, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and other methods. We give the optimal convergence condition of PrePDHG in the sense that the key parameters in the condition can not be further improved, which fills the theoretical gap in the-state-of-art convergence results of PrePDHG, and obtain the ergodic and non-ergodic sublinear convergence rates of PrePDHG. The theoretical analysis is achieved by establishing the equivalence between PrePDHG and indefinite proximal ADMM. Besides, we discuss various choices of the proximal matrices in PrePDHG and derive some interesting results. For example, the convergence condition of diagonal PrePDHG is improved to be tight, the dual stepsize of the balanced augmented Lagrangian method can be enlarged to 4/3 from 1, and a balanced augmented Lagrangian method with symmetric Gauss-Seidel iterations is also explored. Numerical results on the matrix game, projection onto the Birkhoff polytope, earth mover’s distance, and CT reconstruction verify the effectiveness and superiority of PrePDHG.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe consider the numerical solution of Poisson’s equation on structured grids using geometric multigrid with nonstandard coarse grids and coarse-level operators. We are motivated by the problem of developing high-order accurate numerical solvers for elliptic boundary value problems on complex geometry using overset grids. For flexibility in grid generation, we would like to consider lower-order accurate coarse-level approximations, and coarsening factors other than two. We show that second-order accurate coarse-level approximations are very effective for fourth- or sixth-order accurate fine-level finite-difference discretizations. We study the use of different Galerkin and non-Galerkin coarse-level operators. Using local Fourier analysis (LFA) we choose the smoothing parameter \n                      \n                      \\(\\omega \\)\n                      \n                     and the coarse-level operators to optimize the overall multigrid convergence rate. We show that the results based on LFA for periodic problems also hold for more general boundary conditions provided these are discretized using compatibility conditions. Numerical results for Poisson’s equation on a sample overset grid show that our multigrid solver is many times faster, and uses less memory, than selected Krylov solvers and an algebraic multigrid solver. We also study grid coarsening by a general factor and show that good convergence rates are retained for a range of coarsening factors around two. We ask the question of which coarsening factor leads to the most efficient multigrid algorithm.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper addresses a simple energy-based overset finite element method (EbO-FEM) to solve pseudo-static deformation problems consisting of overlapped meshes based on the domain composition method (DCM). This scheme is a non-iterative equation-based method for enforcing the continuity of the displacement field. Hence, the scheme consumes possible minimal computational costs for deformation problems with non-conforming overlapping meshes. The system’s total energy is augmented with continuity constraint energy (CCE) which is a function of the gaps in the displacement field between two overlapping regions. Subsequently, two conventional integration schemes, the Gauss-point projection, and the point-to-point projection, are utilized to discretize the CCE. It is confirmed that both schemes can yield accurate and unique solutions in the overlapped region of the finite element meshes. Further, we proposed a dimensionless relative penalty parameter (DRP). We found that DRP ranging between 1 to 10 is appropriate to robustly obtain accurate solutions for a wide range of scales, stiffness, and geometries, which is supported by three numerical simulations without increasing computational costs after assembling the global matrices and vectors.",

The method is implemented as a new solver in ForestClaw, a software for parallel adaptive mesh refinement of patch-based solvers. On each Cartesian grid patch the single grid Active Flux method can be applied. The exchange of data between grid patches is organised via ghost cells. The local stencil in space and time and the availability of the point values that are used for the reconstruction, leads to an efficient implementation.
