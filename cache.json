          "description": "Abstract\nWe develop a distributed Block Chebyshev-Davidson algorithm to solve large-scale leading eigenvalue problems for spectral analysis in spectral clustering. First, the efficiency of the Chebyshev-Davidson algorithm relies on the prior knowledge of the eigenvalue spectrum, which could be expensive to estimate. This issue can be lessened by the analytic spectrum estimation of the Laplacian or normalized Laplacian matrices in spectral clustering, making the proposed algorithm very efficient for spectral clustering. Second, to make the proposed algorithm capable of analyzing big data, a distributed and parallel version has been developed with attractive scalability. The speedup by parallel computing is approximately equivalent to \n                      \n                      \\(\\sqrt{p}\\)\n                      \n                    , where p denotes the number of processes. Numerical results will be provided to demonstrate its efficiency in spectral clustering and scalability advantage over existing eigensolvers used for spectral clustering in parallel computing environments.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe propose an Eulerian–Lagrangian (EL) Runge–Kutta (RK) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for a linear hyperbolic system. The method is designed based on the ELDG method for transport problems (J Comput Phys 446:110,632, 2021), which tracks solutions along approximations to characteristics in the DG framework, allowing extra large time stepping sizes with stability with respect to the classical RKDG method. Considering each characteristic family, a straightforward application of ELDG for the hyperbolic system will be to transform to the characteristic variables, evolve them on associated characteristic-related space–time regions, and transform them back to the original variables. However, the conservation could not be guaranteed in a general setting. In this paper, we formulate a conservative semi-discrete ELDG method by decomposing each variable into two parts, each of them associated with a different characteristic family. As a result, four different quantities are evolved in EL fashion and recombined to update the solution. The fully discrete scheme is formulated by using method-of-lines RK methods, with intermediate RK solutions updated on the background mesh. Numerical results for 1D and 2D wave equations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed ELDG method. These include the high order spatial and temporal accuracy, stability with extra large time stepping size, and conservative property.",

          "description": "Abstract\nFor magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, the existing entropy stable (ES) flux effectively eliminates the spurious oscillation, but it still has potential for improvement such as the resolution of discontinuous solutions. We propose a high-resolution scheme based on a moving mesh strategy for approximating solutions of ideal MHD and shallow water MHD (SWMHD) in this paper. Firstly, a new S-M flux limiter is constructed to weigh the ES flux and the anti-diffusive flux to obtain a new flux with high resolution and entropy stability properties. By adjusting the amplitude of anti-diffusive flux adaptively, the new flux can reduce its dissipation in smooth regions and increase dissipation at discontinuities, which is more consistent with physical laws. Secondly, we introduce the moving mesh strategy to optimize mesh generation and eliminate the defects of structured mesh. A new monitor function is defined to identify structural features of solutions at each particular time level and to assign appropriate weights to all regions with large numerical solution gradients, to construct a mesh evolution equation and increase the mesh density of these regions. Finally, we combine the moving mesh strategy with the high-resolution ES scheme and evaluate more accurate solutions according to the order of “mesh redistribution-update of solution-equation solving on new mesh”. Numerical results show that the new algorithm can achieve strong robustness and high resolution, and can track various waves effectively (especially the shock and rarefaction waves).",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe Navier equation is the governing equation of elastic waves, and computing its solution accurately and rapidly has a wide range of applications in geophysical exploration, materials science, etc. In this paper, we focus on the efficient and high-precision numerical algorithm for the time harmonic elastic wave scattering problems from cornered domains via the boundary integral equations in two dimensions. The approach is based on the combination of Nyström discretization, analytical singular integrals and kernel-splitting method, which results in a high-order solver for smooth boundaries. It is then combined with the recursively compressed inverse preconditioning (RCIP) method to solve elastic scattering problems from cornered domains. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy, with stabilized errors close to machine precision in various geometric configurations. The algorithm is further applied to investigate the asymptotic behavior of density functions associated with boundary integral operators near corners, and the numerical results are highly consistent with the theoretical formulas.",

We mimic the continuous entropy analysis on the semi-discrete level with the DGSEM constructed on Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto (LGL) nodes. The use of LGL nodes endows the collocated nodal DGSEM with the summation-by-parts property that is key in the discrete analysis. The approximation exploits an equivalent flux differencing formulation for the volume contributions, which generate an entropy conservative split-form of the governing equations. A specific combination of a numerical surface flux and discretization of the nonconservative terms is then applied to obtain a high-order path-conservative scheme that is entropy conservative. Furthermore, we find that this combination yields an analogous discretization for the pressure and nonconservative terms such that the numerical method is well-balanced for discontinuous bathymetry on curvilinear domains. Dissipation is added at the interfaces to create an entropy stable approximation that satisfies the second law of thermodynamics in the discrete case, while maintaining the well-balanced property. We conclude with verification of the theoretical findings through numerical tests and demonstrate results about convergence, entropy stability and well-balancedness of the scheme.",

In this work, we consider a nonlinear strain-limiting elastic model in heterogeneous domains. We investigate heterogeneous material with soft and stiff inclusions and perforations that are important to understand an elastic solid’s behavior and crack-tip fields. Numerical solutions of problems in computational domains with inclusions and perforations require the construction of a sufficiently fine grid that resolves heterogeneity on the grid level. Approximations on such grids lead to a large system of equations with large computational costs. To reduce the size of the system and provide an accurate solution, we present a generalized multiscale finite element approximation on the coarse grid. In this method, we construct multiscale basis functions in each local domain associated with the coarse-grid cell and based on the construction of the snapshot space and solution of the local spectral problem reduce the size of the snapshot space. Two types of multiscale basis function construction are presented. The first type is a general case that can handle any boundary conditions on the global boundary of the heterogeneous domain. The considered problem requires an accurate approximation of the crack-surface boundary. In the second type of multiscale basis functions, we incorporate global boundary conditions in the basis construction process which provide an accurate approximation of the stress and strain on the crack boundary. We present numerical results for three cases of heterogeneity: soft inclusions, stiff inclusions, and perforations. A numerical investigation is presented for the two examples of loading on the domain with and without crack boundary conditions. The presented generalized multiscale finite element solver provides an accurate solution with a large reduction of the discrete system size. Our results illustrate the significant error reduction on the crack surface when we use the second type of basis functions.",

We propose a scheme for data-driven parameterization of unresolved dimensions of dynamical systems based on the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and Koopman operator theory. Given a system in which some components of the state are unknown, this method involves defining a surrogate system in a time-dependent quantum state which determines the fluxes from the unresolved degrees of freedom at each timestep. The quantum state is a density operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space of classical observables and evolves over time under an action induced by the Koopman operator. The quantum state also updates with new values of the resolved variables according to a quantum Bayes’ law, implemented via an operator-valued feature map. Kernel methods are utilized to learn data-driven basis functions and represent quantum states, observables, and evolution operators as matrices. The resulting computational schemes are automatically positivity-preserving, aiding in the physical consistency of the parameterized system. We analyze the results of two different modalities of this methodology applied to the Lorenz 63 and Lorenz 96 multiscale systems and show how this approach preserves important statistical and qualitative properties of the underlying chaotic dynamics.",

A generalized finite element method (FEM) is proposed for solving a heterogeneous reaction-diffusion equation with a singular perturbation parameter [math], based on locally approximating the solution on each subdomain by solution of a local reaction-diffusion equation and eigenfunctions of a local eigenproblem. These local problems are posed on some domains slightly larger than the subdomains with oversampling size [math]. The method is formulated at the continuous level as a direct discretization of the continuous problem and at the discrete level as a coarse-space approximation for its standard finite element (FE) discretizations. Exponential decay rates for local approximation errors with respect to [math] and [math] (at the discrete level with [math] denoting the fine FE mesh size) and with the local degrees of freedom are established. In particular, it is shown that the method at the continuous level converges uniformly with respect to [math] in the standard [math] norm, and that if the oversampling size is relatively large with respect to [math] and [math] (at the discrete level), the solutions of the local reaction-diffusion equations provide good local approximations for the solution and thus the local eigenfunctions are not needed.

We previously showed that three-dimensional quadratic diffeomorphisms have anti-integrable (AI) limits that correspond to a quadratic correspondence, a pair of one-dimensional maps. At the AI limit the dynamics is conjugate to a full shift on two symbols. Here we consider a more general AI limit, allowing two parameters of the map to go to infinity. We prove the existence of AI states for each symbol sequence for three cases of the quadratic correspondence: parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas. A contraction argument gives parameter domains such that this is a bijection, but the correspondence also is observed to apply more generally. We show that orbits of the original map can be obtained by numerical continuation for a volume-contracting case. These results show that periodic AI states evolve into the observed periodic attractors of the diffeomorphism. We also continue a periodic AI state with a symbol sequence chosen so that it continues to an orbit resembling a chaotic attractor that is a 3D version of the classical 2D Hénon attractor.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Volume 84, Issue 1, Page 246-261, February 2024. \n Abstract. The scattering phase, defined as [math] where [math] is the (unitary) scattering matrix, is the analogue of the counting function for eigenvalues when dealing with exterior domains and is closely related to Kreĭn’s spectral shift function. We revisit classical results on asymptotics of the scattering phase and point out that it is never monotone in the case of strong trapping of waves. Perhaps more importantly, we provide the first numerical calculations of scattering phases for nonradial scatterers. They show that the asymptotic Weyl law is accurate even at low frequencies and reveal effects of trapping such as lack of monotonicity. This is achieved by using the recent high level multiphysics finite element software FreeFEM.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Volume 84, Issue 1, Page 262-284, February 2024. \n Abstract. In this paper, we develop a general mathematical framework for perfect and approximate hydrodynamic cloaking and shielding of electro-osmotic flow, which is governed by a coupled PDE system via the field-effect electro-osmosis. We first establish the representation formula of the solution of the coupled system using the layer potential techniques. Based on the Fourier series, the perfect hydrodynamic cloaking and shielding conditions are derived for the control region with the cross-sectional shape being an annulus or a confocal ellipses. Then we further propose an optimization scheme for the design of approximate cloaks and shields within general geometries. The well-posedness of the optimization problem is proved. In particular, the conditions that can ensure the occurrence of approximate cloaks and shields for general geometries are also established. Our theoretical findings are validated and supplemented by a variety of numerical results. The results in this paper also provide a mathematical foundation for more complex hydrodynamic cloaking and shielding.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. Given a directed graph as input, we show how to efficiently find a shortest (directed, simple) cycle on an even number of vertices. As far as we know, no polynomial-time algorithm was previously known for this problem. In fact, finding any even cycle in a directed graph in polynomial time was open for more than two decades until Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas (Ann. of Math. (2), 150 (1999), pp. 929–975) and, independently, McCuaig (Electron. J. Combin., 11 (2004), R7900) (announced jointly at STOC 1997) gave an efficiently testable structural characterization of even-cycle-free directed graphs. Methodologically, our algorithm relies on the standard framework of algebraic fingerprinting and randomized polynomial identity testing over a …",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 53, Issue 1, Page 1-46, February 2024. \n Abstract. We consider the problem of finding nearly optimal solutions of optimization problems with random objective functions. Such problems arise widely in the theory of random graphs, theoretical computer science, and statistical physics. Two concrete problems we consider are (a) optimizing the Hamiltonian of a spherical or Ising [math]-spin glass model and (b) finding a large independent set in a sparse Erdős–Rényi graph. The following families of algorithms are considered: (a) low-degree polynomials of the input—a general framework that captures many prior algorithms; (b) low-depth Boolean circuits; (c) the Langevin dynamics algorithm, a canonical Monte Carlo analogue of the gradient descent algorithm. We show …",
