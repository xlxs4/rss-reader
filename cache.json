          "description": "Abstract\nAn asymptotic preserving and energy stable scheme for the barotropic Euler system under the low Mach number scaling is designed and analysed. A velocity shift proportional to the pressure gradient is introduced in the convective fluxes, which leads to the dissipation of mechanical energy and the entropy stability at all Mach numbers. The resolution of the semi-implicit in time and upwind finite volume in space fully-discrete scheme involves two steps: the solution of an elliptic problem for the density and an explicit evaluation for the velocity. The proposed scheme possesses several physically relevant attributes, such as the positivity of density, the entropy stability and the consistency with the weak formulation of the continuous Euler system. The AP property of the scheme, i.e. the boundedness of the mesh parameters with respect to the Mach number and its consistency with the incompressible limit system, is shown rigorously. The results of extensive case studies are presented to substantiate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method.",

To this end, we represent the solution with an explicit PDF model induced by a flow-based deep generative model, which constructs a transport map from a simple distribution to the target distribution. We consider two methods to approximate the fractional Laplacian. One method is the Monte Carlo approximation. The other method is to construct an auxiliary model with Gaussian radial basis functions (GRBFs) to approximate the solution such that we may take advantage of the fact that the fractional Laplacian of a Gaussian is known analytically. Based on these two different ways for the approximation of the fractional Laplacian, we propose two models to approximate stationary FPEs and one model to approximate time-dependent FPEs.

We present a fast direct solver for boundary integral equations on complex surfaces in three dimensions using an extension of the recently introduced recursive strong skeletonization scheme. For problems that are not highly oscillatory, our algorithm computes an [math]-like hierarchical factorization of the dense system matrix, permitting application of the inverse in [math] time, where [math] is the number of unknowns on the surface. The factorization itself also scales linearly with the system size, albeit with a somewhat larger constant. The scheme is built on a level-restricted adaptive octree data structure, and therefore, it is compatible with highly nonuniform discretizations. Furthermore, the scheme is coupled with high-order accurate locally-corrected Nyström quadrature methods to integrate the singular and weakly-singular Green’s functions used in the integral representations. Our method has immediate applications to a variety of problems in computational physics. We concentrate here on studying its performance in acoustic scattering (governed by the Helmholtz equation) at low to moderate frequencies, and provide rigorous justification for compression of submatrices via proxy surfaces.",

The spectrum of the Koopman operator has been shown to encode many important statistical and geometric properties of a dynamical system. In this work, we consider induced linear operators acting on the space of sections of the state space’s tangent, cotangent, and tensor bundles. We first demonstrate how these operators are natural generalizations of Koopman operators acting on functions. We then draw connections between the various operators’ spectra and characterize the algebraic and differential topological properties of their spectra. We describe the discrete spectrum of these operators for linear dynamical systems and derive spectral expansions for linear vector fields. We define the notion of an “eigendistribution,” provide conditions for an eigendistribution to be integrable, and demonstrate how to recover the foliations arising from their integral manifolds. Last, we demonstrate that the characteristic Lyapunov exponents of a uniformly hyperbolic dynamical system are in the spectrum of the induced operators on sections of the tangent or cotangent bundle. We conclude with an application to differential geometry where the well-known fact that the flows of commuting vector fields commute is generalized, and we recover the original statement as a particular case of our result. We also apply our results to recover the Lyapunov exponents and the stable/unstable foliations of Arnold’s cat map via the spectrum of the induced operator on sections of the tangent bundle.",

Developing a model to capture all aspects of a complex dynamical system is an immense task, and each model will have deficiencies in some areas, such as global climate models having difficulty in capturing tropical intraseasonal variability such as the Madden–Julian oscillation. Besides complex models, it is possible to create simplified, low-dimensional models to capture specific phenomena while ignoring many aspects of the full system. Here, we propose a strategy to allow complex models to communicate with simplified models throughout a simulation. The communication allows one to leverage the strengths of each model, without needing to change their dynamics, to mitigate model error. Furthermore, to ensure ease of implementation in complex systems, the strategy is based on common data assimilation techniques that are normally used to combine models and real-world data. This strategy is investigated here in a test case that is nonlinear, non-Gaussian, and high-dimensional (approximately [math] degrees of freedom), and the multiple models have different state spaces. In particular, it is an idealized tropical climate model in three spatial dimensions. The multimodel communication strategy is seen to mitigate model error and reproduce statistical features akin to those of the truth model when the communication is sufficiently frequent. In these tests, the low-dimensional model contributes only two degrees of freedom, which suggests that, in some systems, large amounts of model error can possibly be reduced by focusing on a small set of model components.",

We propose a framework to study tipping points in reaction-diffusion equations (RDEs) in one spatial dimension, where the reaction term decays in space (asymptotically homogeneous) and varies linearly with time (nonautonomous) due to an external input. A compactification of the moving-frame coordinate together with Lin’s method to construct heteroclinic orbits along intersections of stable and unstable invariant manifolds allows us to (i) obtain multiple coexisting pulse and front solutions for the RDE by computing heteroclinic orbits connecting equilibria at negative and positive infinity in the compactified moving-frame ordinary differential equation, (ii) detect tipping points as dangerous bifurcations of such heteroclinic orbits, and (iii) obtain tipping diagrams by numerical continuation of such bifurcations. We apply our framework to an illustrative model of a habitat patch that features an Allee effect in population growth and is geographically shrinking or shifting due to human activity or climate change. Thus, we identify two classes of tipping points to extinction: bifurcation-induced tipping (B-tipping) when the shrinking habitat falls below some critical length and rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) when the shifting habitat exceeds some critical speed. We explore two-parameter R-tipping diagrams to understand how the critical speed depends on the size of the habitat patch and the dispersal rate of the population, uncover parameter regions where the shifting population survives, and relate these regions to the invasion speed in an infinite homogeneous habitat. Furthermore, we contrast the tipping instabilities with gradual transitions to extinction found for logistic population growth without the Allee effect.",

The study of emergent behavior of swarms is of great interest for applied sciences. One of the most fundamental questions for self-organizing swarms is whether the swarms disperse or remain in a spatially cohesive configuration. In this paper we study dissipativity properties and spatial cohesiveness of the swarm of self-propelled particles governed by the model [math], where [math], [math], and [math] is a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix. The self-propulsion term is assumed to be continuously differentiable and to grow faster than [math], that is, [math] as [math]. We establish that the velocity and acceleration of the particles are ultimately bounded. We show that when [math] is trivial, the positions of the particles are also ultimately bounded. For systems with [math], we show that, while the system might infinitely drift away from its initial location, the particles remain within a bounded distance from the generalized center of mass of the system, which geometrically coincides with the weighted average of agent positions. The weights are determined by the coefficients of the projection matrix onto [math]. We also discuss the ultimate boundedness for systems with bounded coupling, including the Morse potential systems, and systems governed by power-law potentials with strong repulsion properties. We show that the former systems are ultimately bounded in the velocity-acceleration domain, whereas the models based on the power-law potentials are not.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. The circadian clock is an internal timer that coordinates the daily rhythms of behavior and physiology, including sleep and hormone secretion. Accurately tracking the state of the circadian clock, or circadian phase, holds immense potential for precision medicine. Wearable devices present an opportunity to estimate the circadian phase in the real world, as they can noninvasively monitor various physiological outputs influenced by the circadian clock. However, accurately estimating circadian phase from wearable data remains challenging, primarily due to the lack of methods that integrate minute-by-minute wearable data with prior knowledge of the circadian phase. To address this issue, we propose a framework that integrates multitime scale physiological data and estimates the circadian phase, along with an efficient implementation algorithm based on Bayesian inference and a new state space estimation method called the level set Kalman filter. Our numerical experiments indicate that our approach outperforms previous methods for circadian phase estimation consistently. Furthermore, our method enables us to examine the contribution of noise from different sources to the estimation, which was not feasible with prior methods. We found that internal noise unrelated to external stimuli is a crucial factor in determining estimation results. Last, we developed a user-friendly computational package and applied it to real-world data to demonstrate the potential value of our approach. Our results provide a foundation for systematically understanding the real-world dynamics of the circadian clock.",

We consider the logistic metapopulation model over a stream network and use the metapopulation growth rate and the total biomass (of the positive equilibrium) as metrics for different aspects of population persistence. Our objective is to find distributions of resources that maximize these persistence measures. We begin our study by considering stream networks consisting of three nodes and prove that the strategy to maximize the total biomass is to concentrate all the resources in the most upstream locations. In contrast, when the diffusion rates are sufficiently small, the metapopulation growth rate is maximized when all resources are concentrated in one of the most downstream locations. These two main results are generalized to stream networks with any number of patches.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. Laws of large numbers guarantee that given a large enough sample from some population, the measure of any fixed subpopulation is well-estimated by its frequency in the sample. We study laws of large numbers in sampling processes that can affect the environment they are acting upon and interact with it. Specifically, we consider the sequential sampling model proposed by [O. Ben-Eliezer and E. Yogev, The adversarial robustness of sampling, in Proceedings of the 39th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS), 2020, pp. 49–62] and characterize the classes which admit a uniform law of large numbers in this model: these are exactly the classes that are online learnable. Our characterization may be interpreted as an online analogue to the equivalence between learnability and uniform convergence in statistical (PAC) learning. The sample-complexity bounds we obtain are tight for many parameter regimes, and as an application, we determine the optimal regret bounds in online learning, stated in terms of Littlestone’s dimension, thus resolving the main open question from [S. Ben-David, D. Pál, and S. Shalev-Shwartz, Agnostic online learning, in Proceedings of the 22nd Conference on Learning Theory (COLT), 2009], which was also posed by [A. Rakhlin, K. Sridharan, and A.
