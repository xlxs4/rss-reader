With the electric field measurement on part of domain boundary, we formulate the reconstruction problem as a constrained optimization problem with total variation regularization. The existence and stability are proved for the solution to the optimization problem. The finite element method is employed to discretize the optimization problem. The gradient Lipschitz property of the objective functional is established for the discrete optimization problem. We propose a novel modification to the traditional alternating direction method of multipliers, and prove the convergence of the modified algorithm. Finally, we show some numerical experiments to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we develop a high-order semi-implicit (SI) structure-preserving finite difference weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) scheme for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations with a gravitational source. The proposed scheme is well-balanced for magnetic steady states, divergence-free for the magnetic field, conservative in the high Mach regime, and exhibits asymptotic preserving (AP) and asymptotically accurate (AA) properties in the incompressible low sonic Mach regime. The constrained transport method is applied to maintain a discrete divergence-free magnetic field. The sonic Mach number \n                      \n                      \\(\\varepsilon \\)\n                      \n                     ranging from 0 to \n                      \n                      \\(\\mathcal {O}(1)\\)\n                      \n                     is taken into account for all Mach flows. One of the crucial and novel ingredients is the addition of an evolution equation for the perturbation of potential temperature as an auxiliary equation to the conservative MHD system. This addition ensures a correct asymptotic low sonic Mach limit and helps to effectively capture shocks in the compressible high Mach regime. A well-balanced finite difference WENO scheme is designed for conservative variables of the resulting system. With stiffly accurate SI implicit-explicit Runge–Kutta time discretizations, the AP and AA properties are formally proven. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the effectiveness and structure-preserving properties of the proposed scheme.",

By using specific exponential weights when computing the \n                      \n                      \\(L^2\\)\n                      \n                     product in each cell of the discretization, we are able to mimic the behavior of the Slotboom variables, and eliminate the drift term from the local matrix contributions, while still solving the problem for the primal variables. We show that the proposed numerical scheme is well-posed, and validates numerically that it has the same properties as classical HDG methods, including optimal convergence, and superconvergence of postprocessed solutions. For polynomial degree zero, dimension one, and vanishing HDG stabilization parameter, W-HDG coincides with the Scharfetter–Gummel finite volume scheme (i.e., it produces the same system matrix). The use of local exponential weights generalizes the Scharfetter–Gummel scheme (the state-of-the-art for finite volume discretization of transport-dominated problems) to arbitrary high-order approximations.",

In SLPG, the orthonormalization process is invoked only once at the last step if high precision for feasibility is needed, showing that main iterations in SLPG are orthonormalization-free. Besides, both the tangential steps and normal steps do not involve the penalty parameter, and thus SLPG is penalty-free and avoids the inefficiency caused by possible inappropriate penalty parameter.

The base model includes bending and torsion effects, as well as inextensibility. A minimizing movements, descent scheme is proposed for computing energy minimizers, under the non-convex inextensibility, self-contact, and container constraints (if the container is non-convex). At each pseudo time-step of the scheme, the constraints are linearized, which yields a convex minimization problem (at every time-step) with affine equality and inequality constraints. First order conditions are established for the descent scheme at each time-step, under reasonable assumptions on the admissible set. Furthermore, under a mild time-step restriction, we prove energy decrease for the descent scheme, and show that all constraints are satisfied to second order in the time-step, regardless of the total number of time-steps taken. Moreover, we give a modification of the scheme that regularizes the inequality constraints, and establish convergence of the regularized solution. We then discretize the regularized problem with a finite element method using Hermite and Lagrange elements. Several numerical experiments are shown to illustrate the method, including an example that exhibits massive amounts of self-contact for a tightly packed curve inside a sphere.",

We develop a subcell based limiter by blending LWFR with a lower order scheme, either first order finite volume or MUSCL-Hancock scheme. While the blending with a lower order scheme helps to control spurious oscillations, it may not guarantee admissibility of discrete solution, e.g., positivity property of quantities like density and pressure. By exploiting the subcell structure and admissibility of lower order schemes, we devise a strategy to ensure that the blended scheme is admissibility preserving for the mean values and then use a scaling limiter to obtain admissibility of the polynomial solution. For MUSCL-Hancock scheme on non-cell-centered subcells, we develop a slope limiter, time step restrictions and suitable blending of higher order fluxes, that ensures admissibility of lower order updates and hence that of the cell averages. By using the MUSCL-Hancock scheme on subcells and Gauss-Legendre points in flux reconstruction, we improve small-scale resolution compared to the subcell-based RKDG blending scheme with first order finite volume method and Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto points.

After spatial reconstruction in each time marching, a detective process is used to examine the positivity of density and pressure at some checking points in each target cell. If the negativity happens at one checking point, a new compression limiter is carried out to ensure that the modified polynomials can achieve the positivity of density and pressure in the whole target cell instead of only at some discrete points. This treatment is easily implemented, owing to a quick and simple way to overestimate the minimum and maximum values of the polynomials of density and pressure in the target cell. Some numerical experiments for classical extreme problems show that the proposed method has an advantage in computational efficiency and robustness in comparison to the classical positivity-preserving techniques (Zhang and Shu in J Comput Phys 229:8918–8934, 2010), since the CFL number of 0.6 is allowed for all tests in this paper.",

We study the large-scale behavior of a small-strain lattice model for a network composed of elastoplastic springs with random material properties. We formulate the model as an evolutionary rate independent system. In an earlier work we derived a homogenized continuum model, which has the form of linearized elastoplasticity, as an evolutionary [math]-limit as the lattice parameter tends to zero. In the present paper we introduce a periodic representative volume element (RVE) approximation for the homogenized system. As a main result we prove convergence of the RVE approximation as the size of the RVE tends to infinity. We also show that the hysteretic stress-strain relation of the effective system can be described with the help of a generalized Prandtl–Ishlinskii operator, and we prove convergence of a periodic RVE approximation for that operator. We combine the RVE approximation with a numerical scheme for rate-independent systems and obtain a computational scheme that we use to numerically investigate the homogenized system in the specific case when the original network is given by a two-dimensional lattice model. We simulate the response of the system to cyclic and uniaxial, monotonic loading, and numerically investigate the convergence rate of the periodic RVE approximation. In particular, our simulations show that the RVE error decays with the same rate as the RVE error in the static case of linear elasticity.",

          "description": "Multiscale Modeling & Simulation, Volume 22, Issue 1, Page 561-587, March 2024. \n Abstract. The noisy leaky integrate-and-fire (NLIF) model describes the voltage configurations of neuron networks with an interacting many-particles system at a microscopic level. When simulating neuron networks of large sizes, computing a coarse-grained mean-field Fokker–Planck equation solving the voltage densities of the networks at a macroscopic level practically serves as a feasible alternative in its high efficiency and credible accuracy when the interaction within the network remains relatively low. However, the macroscopic model fails to yield valid results of the networks when simulating considerably synchronous networks with active firing events. In this paper, we propose a multiscale solver for the NLIF networks, inheriting the macroscopic solver’s low cost and the microscopic solver’s high reliability. For each temporal step, the multiscale solver uses the macroscopic solver when the firing rate of the simulated network is low, while it switches to the microscopic solver when the firing rate tends to blow up. Moreover, the macroscopic and microscopic solvers are integrated with a high-precision switching algorithm to ensure the accuracy of the multiscale solver. The validity of the multiscale solver is analyzed from two perspectives: first, we provide practically sufficient conditions that guarantee the mean-field approximation of the macroscopic model and present rigorous numerical analysis on simulation errors when coupling the two solvers; second, the numerical performance of the multiscale solver is validated through simulating several large neuron networks, including networks with either instantaneous or periodic input currents which prompt active firing events over some time.",

Quadratization of polynomial and nonpolynomial systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is advantageous in a variety of disciplines, such as systems theory, fluid mechanics, chemical reaction modeling, and mathematical analysis. A quadratization reveals new variables and structures of a model, which may be easier to analyze, simulate, and control, and provides a convenient parametrization for learning. This paper presents novel theory, algorithms, and software capabilities for quadratization of nonautonomous ODEs. We provide existence results, depending on the regularity of the input function, for cases when a quadratic-bilinear system can be obtained through quadratization. We further develop existence results and an algorithm that generalizes the process of quadratization for systems with arbitrary dimension that retain the nonlinear structure when the dimension grows. For such systems, we provide dimension-agnostic quadratization. An example is semidiscretized PDEs, where the nonlinear terms remain symbolically identical when the discretization size increases. As an important aspect for practical adoption of this research, we extended the capabilities of the QBee software towards both nonautonomous systems of ODEs and ODEs with arbitrary dimension. We present several examples of ODEs that were previously reported in the literature, and where our new algorithms find quadratized ODE systems with lower dimension than the previously reported lifting transformations. We further highlight an important area of quadratization: reduced-order model learning. This area can benefit significantly from working in the optimal lifting variables, where quadratic models provide a direct parametrization of the model that also avoids additional hyperreduction for the nonlinear terms. A solar wind example highlights these advantages.",

Koopman operator theory provides a way to solve two-dimensional nonlinear systems, under suitable restrictions, by mapping nonlinear dynamics to a linear space using Koopman eigenfunctions. Unfortunately, finding such eigenfunctions is difficult. We introduce a method for constructing Koopman eigenfunctions from a two-dimensional nonlinear ODE’s one-dimensional invariant manifolds. This method, when successful, allows us to find analytical solutions for autonomous, nonlinear systems. Previous data-driven methods have used Koopman theory to construct local Koopman eigenfunction approximations valid in different regions of phase space; our method finds analytic Koopman eigenfunctions that are exact and globally valid. We demonstrate our Koopman method of solving nonlinear systems on one-dimensional and two-dimensional ODEs. The nonlinear examples considered have simple expressions for their codimension-1 invariant manifolds which produce tractable analytical solutions. Thus our method allows for the construction of analytical solutions for previously unsolved ODEs. It also highlights the connection between invariant manifolds and eigenfunctions in nonlinear ODEs and presents avenues for extending this method to solve more nonlinear systems.",

It has become well known that the Koopman generators for control-affine systems also have affine dependence on the input, leading to convenient finite-dimensional bilinear approximations of the dynamics. Yet there are still two main obstacles that limit the scope of current approaches for approximating the Koopman generators of systems with actuation. First, the performance of existing methods depends heavily on the choice of basis functions over which the Koopman generator is to be approximated; and there is currently no universal way to choose them for systems that are not measure preserving. Second, if we do not observe the full state, then it becomes necessary to account for the dependence of the output time series on the sequence of supplied inputs when constructing observables to approximate Koopman operators. To address these issues, we write the dynamics of observables governed by the Koopman generator as a bilinear hidden Markov model and determine the model parameters using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The E step involves a standard Kalman filter and smoother, while the M step resembles control-affine dynamic mode decomposition for the generator. We demonstrate the performance of this method on three examples, including recovery of a finite-dimensional Koopman-invariant subspace for an actuated system with a slow manifold; estimation of Koopman eigenfunctions for the unforced Duffing equation; and model-predictive control of a fluidic pinball system based only on noisy observations of lift and drag.",

Fluid Mech., 51 (2019), pp. 155–187], a strong normal electric field can cause instability of the interface in a hydrodynamic system. In the present work, singularities arising in electrocapillary-gravity waves on a dielectric fluid of finite depth due to an electric field imposed in the direction perpendicular to the undisturbed free surface are investigated. In shallow water, for a small-amplitude periodic disturbance in the linearly unstable regime, the outcome of the system evolution is that the gas-liquid interface touches the solid bottom boundary, causing a rupture. A quasi-linear hyperbolic model is derived for the long-wave limit and used to study the formation of the touch-down singularity. The theoretical predictions are compared with the fully nonlinear computations by a time-dependent conformal mapping for the electrified Euler equations, showing good agreement. On the other hand, a nonlinear dispersive model system is derived for the deep-water scenario, which predicts the blowup singularity (i.e., the wave amplitude tends to infinity in a finite time). However, when the fluid thickness is significantly large, one can numerically show the self-intersection nonphysical wave structure or 2/3 power cusp singularity in the full Euler equations.",

We consider conservation laws with nonlocal velocity and show, for nonlocal weights of exponential type, that the unique solutions converge in a weak or strong sense (dependent on the regularity of the velocity) to the entropy solution of the local conservation law when the nonlocal weight approaches a Dirac distribution. To this end, we first establish a uniform total variation bound on the nonlocal velocity, which can be used to pass to the limit in the weak solution. For the required entropy admissibility, we use a tailored entropy-flux pair and take advantage of a well-known result that a single strictly convex entropy-flux pair is sufficient for uniqueness, given some additional constraints on the velocity. For general weights, we show that the monotonicity of the initial datum is preserved over time, which enables us to prove convergence to the local entropy solution for rather general kernels if the initial datum is monotone. This case covers the archetypes of local conservation laws: shock waves and rarefactions. These results suggest that a “nonlocal in the velocity” approximation might be better suited to approximating local conservation laws than a nonlocal in the solution approximation, in which such monotonicity only holds for specific velocities.",

The small-amplitude analysis is carried out to obtain two analytical solutions up to the second order.

This manuscript presents an analytic solution to a generalization of the Wiener–Hopf equation in two variables and with three unknown functions. This equation arises in many applications, for example, when solving the discrete Helmholtz equation associated with scattering on a domain with perpendicular boundary. The traditional Wiener–Hopf method is suitable for problems involving boundary data on co-linear semi-infinite intervals, not for boundaries at an angle. This significant extension will enable the analytical solution to a new class of problems with more boundary configurations. Progress is made by defining an underlining manifold that links the two variables. This allows one to meromorphically continue the unknown functions on this manifold and formulate a jump condition. As a result the problem is fully solvable in terms of Cauchy-type integrals, which is surprising since this is not always possible for this type of functional equation.",

A graph whose edges only appear at certain points in time is called a temporal graph (among other names). Such a graph is temporally connected if each ordered pair of vertices is connected by a path which traverses edges in chronological order (i.e., a temporal path). In this paper, we consider a simple model of random temporal graph, obtained from an Erdős–Rényi random graph, [math], by considering a random permutation [math] of the edges and interpreting the ranks in [math] as presence times. We give a thorough study of the temporal connectivity of such graphs and derive implications for the existence of several kinds of sparse spanners. It turns out that temporal reachability in this model exhibits a su…",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 53, Issue 2, Page 315-345, April 2024. \n Abstract. We consider the problem of embedding a subset of [math] into a low-dimensional Hamming cube in an almost isometric way. We construct a simple, data-oblivious, and computationally efficient map that achieves this task with high probability; we first apply a specific structured random matrix, which we call the double circulant matrix; using that a matrix requires linear storage and matrix-vector multiplication that can be performed in near-linear time. We then binarize each vector by comparing each of its entries to a random threshold, selected uniformly at random from a well-chosen interval. We estimate the number of bits required for this encoding scheme in terms of two natural geometric complexity parameters of the set: its Euclidean covering numbers and its localized Gaussian complexity. The estimate we derive turns out to be the best that one can hope for, up to logarithmic terms. The key to the proof is a phenomenon of independent interest: we show that the double circulant matrix mimics the behavior of the Gaussian matrix in two important ways. First, it maps an arbitrary set in [math] into a set of well-spread vectors. Second, it yields a fast near-isometric embedding of any finite subset of [math] into [math]. This embedding achieves the same dimension reduction as the Gaussian matrix in near-linear time, under an optimal condition—up to logarithmic factors—on the number of points to be embedded. This improves a well-known construction due to Ailon and Chazelle.",
