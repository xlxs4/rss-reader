          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a new class of spectral volume (SV) methods are proposed, analyzed, and implemented for diffusion equations, with the viscous flux taken as an interior penalty or direct discontinuous Galerkin formulation. The control volumes are constructed by using four kinds of special points (including Legendre–Gauss, Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto, right Legendre–Gauss–Radau and left Legendre–Gauss–Radau points) in subintervals of the underlying meshes, which leads to four different SV schemes. A framework for the stability analysis and error estimates of the four SV schemes is established. In particular, the influence of the choice of the parameters in the numerical fluxes on the convergence rate and the optimal choices of coefficients for each SV scheme are discussed and provided. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the four SV schemes for both linear and nonlinear diffusion equations.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we concentrate on the robust tensor completion (RTC) problem, which aims to recover a low-rank tensor from partial observations corrupted by sparse noise. Most existing methods for RTC utilize the tensor nuclear norm (TNN) to evaluate the tensor rank. However, the TNN often yields biased solutions due to its loose approximation for the tensor rank. To solve this problem, we derive a unified non-convex surrogate that better approximates the tensor rank. Our surrogate is composed of several non-convex penalty functions. Further, we propose a generalized non-convex model, which minimizes a weighted combination of the unified non-convex surrogate and the \n                      \n                      \\(\\ell _1\\)\n                      \n                    -norm data fidelity term. To solve the proposed model, we devise a simple but efficient algorithm called the proximal alternating difference of convex functions (PADCF) algorithm. Moreover, we prove the sequence generated by the PADCF algorithm converges to the critical point under some mild conditions. Numerical experiments are provided for illustrations and comparisons.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe present a meshfree collocation scheme to discretize intrinsic surface differential operators over scalar fields on smooth curved surfaces with given normal vectors and a non-intersecting tubular neighborhood. The method is based on discretization-corrected particle strength exchange (DC-PSE), which generalizes finite difference methods to meshfree point clouds. The proposed Surface DC-PSE method is derived from an embedding theorem, but we analytically reduce the operator kernels along surface normals to obtain a purely intrinsic computational scheme over surface point clouds. We benchmark Surface DC-PSE by discretizing the Laplace–Beltrami operator on a circle and a sphere, and we present convergence results for both explicit and implicit solvers. We then showcase the algorithm on the problem of computing Gauss and mean curvature of an ellipsoid and of the Stanford Bunny by approximating the intrinsic divergence of the normal vector field. Finally, we compare Surface DC-PSE with surface finite elements (SFEM) and diffuse-interface finite elements (DI FEM) in a validation case.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe multilayer model proposed in this paper is a generalization of the multilayer non-hydrostatic model for shallow granular flows (Fernández-Nieto et al in Commun Math Sci 16(5):1169–1202, 2018. https://doi.org/10.4310/cms.2018.v16.n5.a1), the multilayer model with \n                      \n                      \\(\\mu (I)\\)\n                      \n                     rheology (Fernández-Nieto et al in J Fluid Mech 798:643–681, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2016.333), and the monolayer model with weakly non-hydrostatic pressure for dry granular flows (Garres-Díaz et al in J Sci Comput, 2021. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-020-01377-9). We show that the proposed model verifies a dissipative energy balance. A well-balanced numerical scheme is proposed to solve the equations based on a projection method and a hydrostatic reconstruction for the Coulomb friction terms. In order to reduce the computational cost associated with solving the linear system of the projection method, a precomputing of the initial guess for an iterative solver is proposed.

In the numerical tests, we show that the proposed model can recover the in-depth velocity profiles typically observed in lab experiments and capture the flow/no-flow interface that appears in granular avalanches. During the initial stage of granular collapse simulations, the model is shown to improve the approximation of the mass profiles compared to other models and to predict the parabolic shape of the front velocity evolution with time, as observed in lab experiments. Interestingly, our numerical tests show that the ability of the granular flow to overcome obstacles strongly depends on the model used, which is of strong interest for landslide hazard assessment.",

It is shown that the Kaczmarz algorithm (KACZ) can simulate CD exactly, so CD can be accelerated by CG similarly to the CG acceleration of KACZ (Björck and Elfving in BIT 19:145–163, 1979). Experimental results were carried out on large sets of problems of reconstructing bandlimited functions from random sampling. The randomness causes extreme variance between different instances of these problems, thus causing extreme variance in the advantage of CGCD over CD. The reduction of the number of iterations by CGCD varies from about 50–90% and beyond. The implementation of CGCD is simple. CGCD can also be used for the parallel solution of linear systems derived from partial differential equations, and for the efficient solution of multiple right-hand-side problems and matrix inversion.",

A major theoretical contribution is the existence of consistent and positive stencils for a given point cloud geometry. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of positive stencils by finding neighbors within an ellipse (2d) or ellipsoid (3d) surrounding each interior point, generalizing the study for Poisson’s equation by Seibold (Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 198(3–4):592–601, 2008). It is well-known that wide stencils are in general needed for constructing consistent and monotone finite difference schemes for linear elliptic equations. Our result represents a significant improvement in the stencil width estimate for positive-type finite difference methods for linear elliptic equations in the near-degenerate regime (when the ellipticity constant becomes small), compared to previously known works in this area. Numerical algorithms and practical guidance are provided with an eye on the case of small ellipticity constant. At the end, we present numerical results for the performance of our method in both 2d and 3d, examining a range of ellipticity constants including the near-degenerate regime.",

In order to improve the computational robustness under large density ratios, a nonlinear weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) limiter and a positivity-preserving limiter are specially designed and applied with the aim of dampening the nonphysical oscillations around the phase interface and preventing the occurrence of negative density, respectively. More importantly, we theoretically prove that the present method is able to satisfy the uniform-pressure–velocity criterion which states that uniform pressure and velocity profiles around an isolated phase interface should be preserved during the simulation. The performance of the present method is validated by a range of benchmark test cases with density ratios up to 1000:1.

The present scheme is constructed by applying the hybrid HWENO method based on the zero- and first-order moment with DDG flux to discrete the diffusion term in spatial direction and the third-order TVD Runge–Kutta method in temporal direction. A troubled-cell indicator is first used to identify the cells in which the discontinuity may exist, then the first-order moment in the troubled-cell is reconstructed by fifth-order HWENO scheme. To avoid spurious oscillation, the HWENO reconstruction is performed when the reconstruction stencils contain troubled-cell, otherwise linear reconstruction is performed straightforwardly. Compared with WENO schemes, the present scheme has advantages: (1) compactness, only immediate neighbor cells are used in the reconstruction procedure; (2) accuracy, the numerical errors by the present scheme are smaller than those by WENO schemes.

This limiter is an improvement of the original weighted biased average procedure (WBAP) which is not compact due to its successive limiting feature when applied to high-order schemes. This improvement mainly relies on two new techniques: a successive secondary reconstruction and a two-step WBAP limiter. The new limiter can preserve the original order of accuracy of the high-order finite volume schemes when simulating smooth flow without shock waves, and it shows improvements in accuracy, resolution and convergence property over the original WBAP limiter according to the numerical results of a number of test cases. Furthermore, the compactness of this limiter reduces the amount of data transfer in parallel computing.

Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) and force fields (i.e., interaction laws for atoms and molecules) are typically trained on limited data-sets that cover only a very small section of the full space of possible input structures. MLIPs are nevertheless capable of making accurate predictions of forces and energies in simulations involving (seemingly) much more complex structures. In this article we propose a framework within which this kind of generalization can be rigorously understood. As a prototypical example, we apply the framework to the case of simulating point defects in a crystalline solid. Here, we demonstrate how the accuracy of the simulation depends explicitly on the size of the training structures, on the kind of observations (e.g., energies, forces, force constants, virials) to which the model has been fitted, and on the fit accuracy. The new theoretical insights we gain partially justify current best practices in the MLIP literature and in addition suggest a new approach to the collection of training data and the design of loss functions.",

This work presents a mathematical theory for electromagnetic scattering resonances in a subwavelength annular hole embedded in a metallic slab, with the annulus width [math]. The model is representative among many 3D subwavelength hole structures, which are able to induce resonant scattering of electromagnetic wave and the so-called extraordinary optical transmission. We develop a multiscale framework for the underlying scattering problem based upon a combination of the integral equation in the exterior domain and the waveguide mode expansion inside the tiny hole. The matching of the electromagnetic field over the hole aperture leads to a sequence of decoupled infinite systems, which are used to set up the resonance conditions for the scattering problem. By performing rigorous analysis for the infinite systems and the resonance conditions, we characterize all the resonances in a bounded domain over the complex plane. It is shown that the resonances are associated with the transverse electric (TE) and transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waveguide modes in the annular hole, and they are close to the real axis with the imaginary parts of order [math]. We also investigate resonant scattering when an incident wave is present. It is proved that the electromagnetic field is amplified with order [math] at the resonant frequencies that are associated with the TE modes in the annular hole. On the other hand, one particular resonance associated with the TEM mode cannot be excited by a plane wave but can be excited with a near-field electric dipole source, leading to field enhancement of order [math].",

In this work we propose a model that represents the relation between fish ponds, the mosquito population and the transmission of malaria. It has been observed that in the Amazonic region of Acre, in the North of Brazil, fish farming is correlated to the transmission of malaria when carried out in artificial ponds that become breeding sites. Evidence has been found indicating that cleaning the vegetation from the edges of the crop tanks helps to control the size of the mosquito population. We use our model to determine the effective contribution of fish farming practices on malaria transmission dynamics. The model consists of a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations with jumps at the cleaning time, which act as impulsive controls. We study the asymptotic behavior of the system in function of the intensity and periodicity of the cleaning, and the value of the parameters. In particular, we state sufficient conditions under which the mosquito population is eliminated or persists, and under which the malaria is eliminated or becomes endemic. We prove our conditions by applying results for cooperative systems with concave nonlinearities.",

Working with the linear noise approximation, which is a diffusive approximation to the chemical master equation, we give a computational procedure to certify global identifiability based on Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz. We present a variety of examples that show the applicability of our method to chemical reaction networks of interest in systems and synthetic biology, including discrimination between possible molecular mechanisms for the interaction between biochemical species.",

We formulate an effective numerical scheme that can readily, and accurately, calculate the dynamics of weakly interacting multi-pulse solutions of the quintic complex Ginzburg–Landau equation (QCGLE) in one space dimension. The scheme is based on a global center-manifold reduction where one considers the solution of the QCGLE as the composition of individual pulses plus a remainder function, which is orthogonal to the adjoint eigenfunctions of the linearized operator about a single pulse. This center-manifold projection overcomes the difficulties of other, more orthodox, numerical schemes, by yielding a fast-slow system describing “slow” ordinary differential equations for the locations and phases of the individual pulses, and a “fast” partial differential equation for the remainder function. With small parameter [math] where [math] is a constant and [math] is the minimal pulse separation distance, we write the fast-slow system in terms of first-order and second-order correction terms only, a formulation which is solved more efficiently than the full system. This fast-slow system is integrated numerically using adaptive time-stepping. Results are presented here for two- and three-pulse interactions. For the two-pulse problem, cells of periodic behavior, separated by an infinite set of heteroclinic orbits, are shown to “split” under perturbation creating complex spiral behavior. For the case of three-pulse interaction a range of dynamics, including chaotic pulse interaction, is found. While results are presented for pulse interaction in the QCGLE, the numerical scheme can also be applied to a wider class of parabolic PDEs.",

We explicitly take into account heterogeneity in both oscillation frequency and the type of oscillators characterized by different phase response curves. The central idea is to leverage the Fourier series representation of periodic functions to decode a phase-selective entrainment task into a quadratic program. We demonstrate our approach using a variety of phase models where we entrain the oscillators into distinct phase patterns.

A positively invariant ball and a global attractor for the porous media lattice system are obtained. By the implicit Euler scheme, the continuous-time model is discretized as a discrete-time porous media lattice system, which generates a discrete semigroup on the positively invariant ball for sufficiently small step sizes. It is shown that the discrete semigroup has a numerical attractor, which converges upper semicontinuously to the global attractor as the step size tends to zero. A new subject on enlarged attractors for lattice systems is investigated, which includes unique existence and convergence of attractors as well as solutions on the larger initial space. The second-order Taylor expansion and discretization error on the enlarged regular space are established to prove the upper semicontinuity of the enlarged numerical attractors with respect to the step size, while an upper bound of the enlarged attractors is provided to establish the lower semicontinuity in special cases.",

The task of modeling and forecasting a dynamical system is one of the oldest problems, and it remains challenging. Broadly, this task has two subtasks: extracting the full dynamical information from a partial observation, and then explicitly learning the dynamics from this information. We present a mathematical framework in which the dynamical information is represented in the form of an embedding. The framework combines the two subtasks using the language of spaces, maps, and commutations. The framework also unifies two of the most common learning paradigms: delay-coordinates and reservoir computing. We use this framework as a platform for two other investigations of the reconstructed system, its dynamical stability and the growth of error under iterations. We show that these questions are deeply tied to more fundamental properties of the underlying system, i.e., the behavior of matrix cocycles over the base dynamics, its nonuniform hyperbolic behavior, and its decay of correlations. Thus, our framework bridges the gap between universally observed behavior of dynamics modeling and the spectral, differential, and ergodic properties intrinsic to the dynamics.",

The stability analysis of synchronization in time-varying higher-order networked structures (simplicial complexes) is a challenging problem due to the presence of time-varying group interactions. In this context, most of the previous studies have been done either on temporal pairwise networks or on static simplicial complexes. Here, for the first time, we propose a general framework to study the synchronization phenomenon in temporal simplicial complexes. We show that the synchronous state exists as an invariant solution and obtain the necessary condition for it to emerge as a stable state in the fast-switching regime. We prove that the time-averaged simplicial complex plays the role of synchronization indicator whenever the switching among simplicial topologies is adequately fast. We attempt to transform the stability problem into a master stability function form. Unfortunately, for the general circumstances, the dimension reduction of the master stability equation is cumbersome due to the presence of group interactions. However, we overcome this difficulty in two interesting situations based on either the functional forms of the coupling schemes or the connectivity structure of the simplicial complex, and we demonstrate that the necessary condition mimics the form of a master stability function in these cases. We verify our analytical findings by applying them on synthetic and real-world networked systems. We find that the presence of temporality along with the multiway interactions improves the synchronization phenomena as compared to the static higher-ordered or temporal pairwise system. In addition, our results also reveal that with sufficient higher-order coupling and adequately fast rewiring, the temporal simplicial complex achieves synchrony even in a very low connectivity regime.",

Multisite phosphorylation is a signaling mechanism well known to give rise to multiple steady states, a property termed multistationarity. When phosphorylation occurs in a sequential and distributive manner, we obtain a family of networks indexed by the number of phosphorylation sites [math]. This work addresses the problem of understanding the parameter region where this family of networks displays multistationarity, by focusing on the projection of this region onto the set of kinetic parameters. The problem is phrased in the context of real algebraic geometry and reduced to studying whether a polynomial, defined as the determinant of a parametric matrix of size three, attains negative values over the positive orthant. The coefficients of the polynomial are functions of the kinetic parameters. For any [math], we provide sufficient conditions for the polynomial to be positive and, hence, preclude multistationarity, and also sufficient conditions for it to attain negative values and, hence, enable multistationarity. These conditions are derived by exploiting the structure of the polynomial and its Newton polytope and employing circuit polynomials. A relevant consequence of our results is that the sets of kinetic parameters that enable or preclude multistationarity are both connected for all [math].",

For a mechanical system consisting of a rotator and a pendulum coupled via a small, time-periodic Hamiltonian perturbation, the Arnold diffusion problem asserts the existence of “diffusing orbits” along which the energy of the rotator grows by an amount independent of the size of the coupling parameter, for all sufficiently small values of the coupling parameter. There is a vast literature on establishing Arnold diffusion for such systems. In this work, we consider the case when an additional, dissipative perturbation is added to the rotator-pendulum system with coupling. Therefore, the system obtained is not symplectic but conformally symplectic. We provide explicit conditions on the dissipation parameter, so that the resulting system still exhibits energy growth. The fact that Arnold diffusion may play a role in systems with small dissipation was conjectured by Chirikov. In this work, the coupling is carefully chosen, but the mechanism we present can be adapted to general couplings, and we will deal with the general case in future work.",

Using comparison principles and explicit lower and upper solutions, we show that wave solutions are pinned for small diffusion parameters. Upon increasing the diffusion, the wave starts to travel with nonzero speed, in a direction that depends on the detuning parameter. However, once the diffusion is sufficiently strong, the wave propagates in a single direction up the tree irrespective of the detuning parameter.

The overexploitation of natural resources by our industrial society questions its long-term sustainability.

Econ., 101 (2014), pp. 90–102] to address this concern with a special emphasis on the role of the stratification of the society. In this paper we analyze the dynamics of this model, and we explore the influence of two parameters: the nature depletion rate and the inequality factor. We characterize the asymptotic states of the system through a bifurcation analysis, and we derive several quantitative predictions. We show that some collapses are irreversible and, depending on the wealth production factor, bistability regimes can be obtained. In particular, a sustainable equilibrium can coexist with cycles of prosperity and collapse. We discuss the possible policies to prevent undesirable fates.",

A unified method for analyzing the dynamics and topological structure associated with a class of Floquet topological insulators is presented. The method is applied to a system that describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves through the bulk of a two-dimensional lattice that is helically driven in the direction of propagation. Tight-binding approximations are employed to derive reduced dynamical systems. Further asymptotic approximations, valid in the high-frequency driving regime, yield a time-averaged system which governs the leading order behavior of the wave. From this follows an analytic calculation of the Berry connection, curvature, and Chern number via analyzing the local behavior of the eigenfunctions near the critical points of the spectrum. Examples include honeycomb, Lieb, kagome, and 1/5-depleted lattices. In the nonlinear regime, novel equations governing slowly varying wave envelopes are derived. For the honeycomb lattice, numerical simulations show that for relatively small nonlinear effects a striking spiral pattern occurs; as nonlinearity increases, localized structures emerge, and for somewhat higher nonlinearity the waves appear to collapse.",

Classical gene expression models assume exponential switching time distributions between the active and inactive promoter states. However, recent experiments have shown that many genes in mammalian cells may produce nonexponential switching time distributions, implying the existence of multiple promoter states and molecular memory in the promoter switching dynamics. Here we analytically solve a gene expression model with random bursting and complex promoter switching, and derive the time-dependent distributions of the mRNA and protein copy numbers, generalizing the steady-state solution obtained in [T. Zhou and J. Zhang, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 72 (2012), pp. 789–818] and [U. Herbach, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 79 (2019), pp. 1007–1029]. Using multiscale simplification techniques, we find that molecular memory has no influence on the time-dependent distribution when promoter switching is very fast or very slow, while it significantly affects the distribution when promoter switching is neither too fast nor too slow. By analyzing the dynamical phase diagram of the system, we also find that molecular memory in the inactive gene state weakens transient and stationary bimodality of the copy number distribution, while molecular memory in the active gene state enhances such bimodality.",

When ions are crowded, the effect of steric repulsion between ions (which can produce oscillations in charge density profiles) becomes significant and the conventional Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) equation should be modified. Several modified PB equations were developed but the associated total ionic charge density has no oscillation. This motivates us to derive a general model of PB equations called the PB-steric equations with a parameter [math], which not only include the conventional and modified PB equations but also have oscillatory total ionic charge density under different assumptions of steric effects and chemical potentials. As [math], the PB-steric equation becomes the conventional PB equation, but as [math], the concentrations of ions and solvent molecules are determined by the Lambert type functions. To approach the modified PB equations, we study the asymptotic limit of PB-steric equations with the Robin boundary condition as [math] goes to infinity. Our theoretical results show that the PB-steric equations (for [math]) may include the conventional and modified PB equations. On the other hand, we use the PB-steric equations to find oscillatory total ionic charge density which cannot be obtained in the conventional and modified PB equations.",

This work is concerned with the Dirac points for the honeycomb lattice with impenetrable obstacles arranged periodically in a homogeneous medium. We consider both the Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalue problems and prove the existence of Dirac points for both eigenvalue problems at crossing of the lower band surfaces as well as higher band surfaces. Furthermore, we perform quantitative analyses for the eigenvalues and the slopes of two conical dispersion surfaces near each Dirac point based on a combination of the layer potential technique and asymptotic analysis. It is shown that the eigenvalues are in the neighborhood of the singular frequencies associated with the Green’s function for the honeycomb lattice, and the slopes of the dispersion surfaces are reciprocal to the eigenvalues.",

We study the complexity of local graph-centrality estimation, with the goal of approximating the centrality score of a given target node while exploring only a sublinear number of nodes/arcs of the graph and performing a sublinear number of elementary operations. We develop a technique, which we apply to PageRank and Heat Kernel, for constructing a low-variance score estimator through a local exploration of the graph. We obtain an algorithm that, given any node in any graph of [math] nodes and [math] arcs, with probability [math] computes a multiplicative [math]-approximation of its score by examining only [math] nodes/arcs, where [math] is the maximum outdegree of the graph and [math] and [math] factors are omitted for readability. A similar bound holds for computational cost. We also prove a lower bound of [math] for both query complexity and computational complexity. Moreover, in the jump-and-crawl graph-access model, our technique yields a [math]-queries algorithm; we show that this algorithm is optimal up to a logarithmic factor—in fact, sublogarithmic in the case of PageRank. These are the first algorithms with sublinear worst-case bounds for general directed graphs and any choice of the target node.",
