We introduce an enhanced partially penalized IFE method which includes the penalization on both interface edges and the interface itself. Ghost penalties are also added for pressure robustness. In temporal discretization, \n                      \n                      \\(\\theta \\)\n                      \n                    -schemes and backward differentiation formulas are adopted. Newton’s method is used to handle the nonlinear advection. The proposed method completely circumvent re-meshing in tackling moving-interface problems. Thanks to the isomorphism of our IFE spaces with the standard finite element spaces, the new method enables efficient updates of global matrices, which significantly reduces the overall computational cost. Comprehensive numerical experiments show that the proposed method is third-order convergent for velocity and second-order for pressure in both stationary and moving interface cases.",

This work presents a systematic methodology for describing the transient dynamics of coarse-grained molecular systems inferred from all-atom simulated data. We suggest Langevin-type dynamics where the coarse-grained interaction potential depends explicitly on time to efficiently approximate the transient coarse-grained dynamics. We apply the path-space force matching approach at the transient dynamics regime to learn the proposed model parameters. In particular, we parameterize the coarse-grained potential both with respect to the pair distance of the coarse-grained particles and the time, and we obtain an evolution model that is explicitly time dependent. Moreover, we follow a data-driven approach to estimate the friction kernel, given by appropriate correlation functions directly from the underlying all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. To explore and validate the proposed methodology we study a benchmark system of a moving particle in a box. We examine the suggested model’s effectiveness in terms of the system’s correlation time and find that the model can well approximate the transient time regime of the system, depending on the correlation time of the system. As a result, in the less correlated case, it can represent the dynamics for a longer time interval. We present an extensive study of our approach to a realistic high-dimensional water molecular system. Posing the water system initially out of thermal equilibrium we collect trajectories of all-atom data for the, empirically estimated, transient time regime. Then, we infer the suggested model and strengthen the model’s validity by comparing it with simplified Markovian models.",

We investigate an optimal control model with pointwise constraints governed by a two-time-scale time-fractional advection-diffusion-reaction equation with space-time-dependent fractional order and coefficients, which describes, e.g., the contaminant in groundwater under various transport scales or miscible displacement of hydrocarbon by injected fluid through heterogeneous porous media. To accommodate for the effects of complex fractional order and coefficients, an auxiliary equation method is proposed, along with the Fredholm alternative for compact operators, to analyze the well-posedness of the state equation. Additionally, a bootstrapping argument is utilized to progressively improve the solution regularity through a carefully designed pathway, leading to the maximal regularity estimates. Subsequently, we analyze the adjoint equation derived from the first-order optimality condition, which requires more subtle treatments due to the presence of hidden-memory variable-order fractional operators. Based on these findings, we ultimately analyze the well-posedness, first-order optimality conditions and maximal regularity estimates for the optimal control problem, and we conduct numerical experiments to investigate its behavior in potential applications.",

For many engineered systems it is important to assess vulnerability to potential disturbances in order to ensure reliable operation. Whether the system will recover from a particular finite-time disturbance to a desired stable equilibrium point depends on uncertain and time-varying system parameter values. Therefore, it is valuable to determine, for specific fixed disturbances, the margins for safe operation: the smallest change in parameter values that would cause the system to become vulnerable to the disturbance. The natural setting for this problem is a parameter-dependent vector field with a family of stable equilibria and a parameter-dependent initial condition representing the d…",

At the bottom of the motion, the contact point moves quickly around the rim of the can. The can then rises up again, having rotated through some finite angle of turn [math]. We recast the problem as a second order ODE and find a Frobenius solution. We then use this Frobenius solution to derive a reduced equation of motion. The rocking can exhibits two distinct phenomena: behavior very similar to an inverted pendulum, and dynamics with the angle of turn. This distinction allows us to use matched asymptotic expansions to derive a uniformly valid solution that is in excellent agreement with numerical calculations of the reduced equation of motion. The solution of the inner problem was used to investigate of the angle of turn phenomenon. We also examine the motion of the contact locus [math] and see a range of different trajectories, from circular to petaloid motion and even cusp-like behavior.

The intention of this article is to illustrate the use of methods from symplectic geometry for practical purposes. Our intended audience is scientists interested in orbits of Hamiltonian systems (e.g., the three-body problem). The main directions pursued in this article are as follows: (1) given two periodic orbits, decide when they can be connected by a regular family of periodic orbits; (2) use numerical invariants from Floer theory which help predict the existence of orbits in the presence of a bifurcation; (3) attach a sign [math] to each elliptic or hyperbolic Floquet multiplier of a closed symmetric orbit, which generalizes the classical Krein–Moser sign to also include the hyperbolic case; and (4) do all of the above in a visual, easily implementable, and resource-efficient way. The mathematical framework is provided by the first and third authors in [U. Frauenfelder and A. Moreno, J. Symplectic Geom., to appear], where, as it turns out, the “Broucke stability diagram” [R. Broucke, AIAA J., 7 (1969), pp. 1003–1009] was rediscovered, but further refined with the above signs and algebraically reformulated in terms of quotients of the symplectic group. The advantage of the framework is that it applies to the study of closed orbits of an arbitrary Hamiltonian system. We will carry out numerical work based on the cell-mapping method as described in [D. Koh, R. L. Anderson, and I. Bermejo-Moreno, J. Astronautical Sci., 68 (2021), pp. 172–196] for the Jupiter-Europa and Saturn-Enceladus systems.

Mathematical models come in many forms across biological applications. In the case of complex, spatial dynamics and pattern formation, stochastic models also face two main challenges: pattern data are largely qualitative, and model realizations may vary significantly. Together these issues make it difficult to relate models and empirical data—or even models and models—limiting how different approaches can be combined to offer new insights into biology. These challenges also raise mathematical questions about how models are related, since alternative approaches to the same problem—e.g., Cellular Potts models; off-lattice, agent-based models; on-lattice, cellular automaton models; and continuum approaches—treat uncertainty and implement cell behavior in different ways. To help open the door to future work on questions like these, here we adapt methods from topological data analysis and computational geometry to quantitatively relate two different models of the same biological process in a fair, comparable way. To center our work and illustrate concrete challenges, we focus on the example of zebrafish-skin pattern formation, and we relate patterns that arise from agent-based and cellular automaton models.",

This paper concerns the qualitative analysis on a reaction-diffusion SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) epidemic model governed by the saturated incidence infection mechanism in advective environments. A variational expression of the basic reproduction number [math] was derived and the global dynamics of the system in terms of [math] was established: the disease-free equilibrium is unique and linearly stable if [math] and at least an endemic equilibrium exists if [math]. More precisely, we explore qualitative properties of the basic reproduction number and investigate the spatial distribution of the individuals with respect to the dispersal and advection. We find that the concentration phenomenon occurs when the advection is large and the infectious disease will be eradicated for the small dispersal of infected individual. Our theoretical results may shed some new insight into the infectious disease prediction and control strategy.",

We present an effective model of “space-coiled metacrystals” composed of a periodic array of sound rigid blocks into which long slots have been coiled up. The periodic cell of the block contains a coiled slot whose straight parts are at wavelength scale, which enables the appearance of Bragg resonances. These resonances, which prevent high transmission, compete with the Fabry–Pérot resonances of the entire slot, which foster perfect transmission. This results in complex scattering properties driven by the characteristics of the turning regions that act as atoms in a one-dimensional coiled crystal. Using appropriate scaling and combining two-scale homogenization with matched asymptotic techniques, the modeling of such metacrystals is proposed. The resulting model is validated through a comparison with full-wave numerics in both harmonic and transient regimes.",

In this paper, a coupled electro-calcium model was developed and implemented to computationally explore the effects of neuronal synapse loss, in particular in the context of Alzheimer’s disease. Established parameters affected by Alzheimer’s disease, such as synapse loss, calcium leaks at deteriorating synaptic contacts, and downregulation of the calcium buffer calbindin, are subject to this study. Reconstructed neurons are used to define the computational domain for a system of PDEs and ODEs, discretized by finite differences and solved with a semi-implicit second-order time integrator. The results show neuronal resilience during synapse loss. When incorporating calcium leaks at affected synapses, neurons lose their ability to produce synapse-to-nucleus calcium signals, necessary for learning, plasticity, and neuronal survival. Downregulation of calbindin concentrations partially recovers the signaling pathway to the cell nucleus. These results could define future research pathways toward stabilizing the calcium signaling pathways during Alzheimer’s disease. The coupled electro-calcium model was implemented and solved using MATLAB https://github.com/NeuroBox3D/CalcSim.",

The aim of this article is to advance the field of metamaterials by proposing formulas for the design of high-contrast metamaterials with prescribed subwavelength defect mode eigenfrequencies. This is achieved in two settings: (i) design of non-Hermitian static materials and (ii) design of instantly changing non-Hermitian time-dependent materials. The design of static materials is achieved via characterizing equations for the defect mode eigenfrequencies in the setting of a defected dimer material. These characterizing equations are the basis for obtaining formulas for the material parameters of the defect which admit given defect mode eigenfrequencies. Explicit formulas are provided in the setting of one and two given defect mode eigenfrequencies in the setting of a defected chain of dimers. In the time-dependent case, we first analyze the influence of time boundaries on the subwavelength solutions. We find that subwavelength solutions are preserved if and only if the material parameters satisfy a temporal Snell’s law across the time boundary. The same result also identifies the change of the time frequencies uniquely. Combining this result with those on the design of static materials, we obtain an explicit formula for the material design of instantly changing defected dimer materials which admit subwavelength modes with prescribed time-dependent defect mode eigenfrequency. Finally, we use this formula to create materials which admit spatio-temporally localized defect modes.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Volume 83, Issue 6, Page 2390-2417, December 2023. \n Abstract. Inspired by applications, we study the effect of interface slip on the effective wave propagation in poroelastic materials, which are composites consisting of elastic frames whose pore space is filled with fluid. The current literature on the homogenization for the poroelastic wave equations are all based on the no-slip interface condition posed on the microscale. However, for certain pore fluids, the no-slip condition is known to be physically invalid. In the literature, slip boundary conditions have been considered for porous materials with rigid solid frames. For these rigid porous materials, the wave can only propagate in the pore fluid and hence the equations for the microscale are posed only in the pore space. Consequently, the slip on the interface involves only the fluid velocity and the fluid stress. In contrast, for poroelastic materials, the wave can propagate not only in the pore fluid but also in the solid frame; hence the slip conditions involve the velocities on both sides of the interface, rather than just the fluid side. With this slip condition, a variational boundary value problem governing the small vibrations of a periodic mixture of an elastic solid and a slightly viscous fluid is studied in this paper. The method of two-scale convergence is used to obtain the macroscopic behavior of the solution and to identify the role played by the slip interface condition.",

How morphogenesis depends on cell properties is an active direction of research. Here, we focus on mechanical models of growing plant tissues, where microscopic (sub)cellular structure is taken into account. In order to establish links between microscopic and macroscopic tissue properties, we perform a multiscale analysis of a model of growing plant tissue with subcellular resolution. We use homogenization to rigorously derive the corresponding macroscopic tissue-scale model. Tissue-scale mechanical properties are computed from microscopic structural and material properties, taking into account deformation by the growth field. We then consider case studies and numerically compare the detailed microscopic model and the tissue-scale model, both implemented using the finite element method. We find that the macroscopic model can be used to efficiently make predictions about several configurations of interest. Our work will help making links between microscopic measurements and macroscopic observations in growing tissues.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 52, Issue 6, Page 1413-1463, December 2023. \n Abstract. We prove a general structural theorem for a wide family of local algorithms, which includes property testers, local decoders, and probabilistically checkable proofs of proximity. Namely, we show that the structure of every algorithm that makes [math] adaptive queries and satisfies a natural robustness condition admits a sample-based algorithm with [math] sample complexity, following the definition of Goldreich and Ron [ACM Trans. Comput. Theory, 8 (2016), 7]. We prove that this transformation is nearly optimal. Our theorem also admits a scheme for constructing privacy-preserving local algorithms. Using the unified view that our structural theorem provides, we obtain results regarding various types of local algorithms, including the following. We strengthen the state-of-the-art lower bound for relaxed locally decodable codes, obtaining an exponential improvement on the dependency in query complexity; this resolves an open problem raised by Gur and Lachish [SIAM J. Comput., 50 (2021), pp. 788–813]. We show that any (constant-query) testable property admits a sample-based tester with sublinear sample complexity; this resolves a problem left open in a work of Fischer, Lachish, and Vasudev [Proceedings of the 56th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE, 2015, pp. 1163–1182], bypassing an exponential blowup caused by previous techniques in the case of adaptive testers. We prove that the known separation between proofs of proximity and testers is essentially maximal; this resolves a problem left open by Gur and Rothblum [Proceedings of the 8th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference, 2017, pp. 39:1–39:43; Comput. Complexity, 27 (2018), pp. 99–207] regarding sublinear-time delegation of computation. Our techniques strongly rely on relaxed sunflower lemmas and the Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem.",

The goal is to partition the items into sets [math] such that [math] for every bin [math], where [math] denotes [math]. Björklund, Husfeldt, and Koivisto [SIAM J.

Before our work, such improved algorithms were not known even for [math].
