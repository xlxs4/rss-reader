          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose a new accelerated waveform relaxation (WR) method based on a time-parallel algorithm to solve the general system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It is well known that the WR method decouples or linearizes large-scale complex systems into simple subsystems, which in most cases can be computed in parallel in each iteration. To accelerate the calculation of the WR iteration, we apply a time-parallel approach: the Parareal algorithm, to solve the subsystems in each iteration. It can be thought of as a kind of space-time parallel method. According to different WR types, we present convergence analysis of the accelerated WR methods for the time-continuous case and for the time-discrete case with different discrete schemes. Besides, the speedup analysis of the proposed algorithms is also provided. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical works.",

          "description": "Abstract\nFor the discretization of the convective term in the Navierâ€“Stokes equations, the commonly used convective formulation (CONV) does not preserve kinetic energy if the divergence constraint is only discretely enforced. In this paper, we apply the skew-symmetrization technique in Cockburn et al. (Math Comput 74(251):1067â€“1095, 2005. https://doi.org/10.1090/S0025-5718-04-01718-1) to conforming finite element methods, which restores energy conservation for CONV. The main idea is to replace the discrete advective velocity with an \n                      \n                      \\(H({\\text {div}})\\)\n                      \n                    -conforming divergence-free one in CONV. We prove that the modified convective formulation also conserves linear momentum, helicity, 2D enstrophy and total vorticity under some appropriate senses. The popular CNLE (linearly extrapolated Crankâ€“Nicolson) method also conserves them when this modified formulation is used. Under the assumption \n                      \n                      \\(\\varvec{u}\\in L^{2}(0,T;\\varvec{W}^{1,\\infty }(\\Omega )),\\)\n                      \n                     it can be shown that the Gronwall constant does not explicitly depend on the Reynolds number in the error estimates. Numerical experiments show that the linearized and modified convective formulation has similar performance with the EMAC formulation and outperforms the usual skew-symmetric formulation (SKEW).",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe Laplace transform is a central mathematical tool for analysing 1D/2D signals and for the solution to PDEs; however, its definition and computation on arbitrary data is still an open research problem. We introduce the Laplace transform on arbitrary domains and focus on the spectral Laplace transform, which is defined by applying a 1D filter to the Laplacian spectrum of the input domain. The spectral Laplace transform satisfies standard properties of the 1D and 2D transforms, such as dilation, translation, scaling, derivation, localisation, and relations with the Fourier transform. The spectral Laplace transform is enough general to be applied to signals defined on different discrete data, such as graphs, 3D surface meshes, and point sets. Working in the spectral domain and applying polynomial and rational polynomial approximations, we achieve a stable computation of the spectral Laplace Transform. As main applications, we discuss the computation of the spectral Laplace Transform of functions defined on arbitrary domains (e.g., 2D and 3D surfaces, graphs), the solution of the heat diffusion equation, and graph signal processing.",

That is, PDEs with inputs that are expressed as functions of parameters with an associated probability distribution. Developing efficient and accurate solution strategies that account for errors on the space, time and parameter domains simultaneously is highly challenging. Indeed, it is well known that standard polynomial-based approximations on the parameter domain can incur errors that grow in time. In this work, we focus on advectionâ€“diffusion problems with parameter-dependent wind fields. A novel adaptive solution strategy is proposed that allows users to combine stochastic collocation on the parameter domain with off-the-shelf adaptive timestepping algorithms with local error control. This is a non-intrusive strategy that builds a polynomial-based surrogate that is adapted sequentially in time. The algorithm is driven by a so-called hierarchical estimator for the parametric error and balances this against an estimate for the global timestepping error which is derived from a scaling argument.",

          "description": "Abstract\nNon-overlapping Schwarz methods with generalized Robin transmission conditions were originally introduced by B.Â DesprÃ©s for time-harmonic wave propagation problems and have largely developed over the past thirty years. The aim of the paper is to provide both a review of the available formulations and methods as well as a consistent theory applicable to more general cases than studied until to date. An abstract variational framework is provided reformulating the original problem by the well-known form involving a scattering operator and an interface exchange operator, and the equivalence between the formulations is discussed thoroughly. The framework applies to a series of wave propagation problems throughout the de Rham complex, such as the scalar Helmholtz equation, Maxwellâ€™s equations, a dual formulation of the Helmholtz equation in H(div), as well as any conforming finite element discretization thereof, and it applies also to coercive problems. Three convergence results are shown. The first one (using compactness) and the second one (based on absorption) generalize DesprÃ©sâ€™ early findings and apply as well to the FETI-2LM formulation (a discrete method introduced by de La Bourdonnaye, Farhat, Macedo, MagoulÃ©s, and Roux). The third result, oriented on the work by Collino, Ghanemi, and Joly, establishes a convergence rate and covers cases with cross points, while not requiring any regularity of the solution. The key ingredient is a global interface exchange operator, proposed originally by X.Â Claeys and further developed by Claeys and Parolin, here worked out in full generality. The third type of convergence theory is applicable at the discrete level as well, where the exchange operator is allowed to be even local. The resulting scheme can be viewed as a generalization of the 2-Lagrange-multiplier method introduced by S.Â Loisel, and connections are drawn to another technique proposed by Gander and Santugini.",

          "description": "Multiscale Modeling & Simulation, Volume 21, Issue 3, Page 849-883, September 2023. \n Abstract. In this paper, we present a multiscale framework for solving the Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media without scale separation and in the high frequency regime where the wavenumber [math] can be large. The main innovation is that our methods achieve a nearly exponential rate of convergence with respect to the computational degrees of freedom, using a coarse grid of mesh size [math] without suffering from the well-known pollution effect. The key idea is a nonoverlapped domain decomposition and its associated coarse-fine scale decomposition of the solution space that adapts to the media property and wavenumber; this decomposition is inspired by the multiscale finite element method. We show that the coarse part is of low complexity in the sense that it can be approximated with a nearly exponential rate of convergence via local basis functions, due to the compactness of a restriction operator that maps Helmholtz-harmonic functions to their interpolation residues on edges, while the fine part is local such that it can be computed efficiently using the local information of the right-hand side. The combination of the two parts yields the overall nearly exponential rate of convergence of our multiscale method. Our method draws many connections to multiscale methods in the literature, which we will comment in detail. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods theoretically and numerically; an exponential rate of convergence is consistently observed and confirmed. In addition, we observe the robustness of our methods regarding the high contrast in the media numerically. We specifically focus on 2D problems in our exposition since the geometry of nonoverlapped domain decomposition is simplest to explain in such cases.",

The Suâ€“Schriefferâ€“Heeger model (the canonical example of a one-dimensional system with topologically protected localized defect states) is used to demonstrate the method. Our approach can be used to describe two broad classes of perturbations to periodic differential problems: those caused by inserting a finite-sized piece of arbitrary material and those caused by creating an interface between two different periodic media.

The Kuramoto model provides a prototypical framework for synchronization phenomena in interacting particle systems. Apart from full phase synchrony where all oscillators behave identically, identical Kuramoto oscillators with ring-like nonlocal coupling can exhibit more elaborate patterns such as uniformly twisted states. It was discovered by Wiley, Strogatz, and Girvan in 2006 that the stability of these twisted states depends on the coupling range of each oscillator. In this paper, we analyze twisted states and their bifurcations in the infinite particle limit of ring-like nonlocal coupling. We not only consider traditional pairwise interactions as in the Kuramoto model but also demonstrate the effects of higher-order nonpairwise interactions, which arise naturally in phase reductions. We elucidate how pairwise and nonpairwise interactions affect the stability of the twisted states, compute bifurcating branches, and show that higher-order interactions can stabilize twisted states that are unstable if the coupling is only pairwise.",

Dynamical systems have a wide range of applications in mechanics, electrical engineering, chemistry, and so on. In this work, we propose the adaptive spectral Koopman (ASK) method to solve nonlinear autonomous dynamical systems. This novel numerical method leverages the spectral-collocation (i.e., pseudospectral) method and properties of the Koopman operator to obtain the solution of a dynamical system. Specifically, this solution is represented as a linear combination of the multiplication of the Koopman operatorâ€™s eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, and these eigenpairs are approximated by the spectral method. Unlike conventional time evolution algorithms such as Eulerâ€™s scheme and the Rungeâ€“Kutta scheme, ASK is mesh free and hence is more flexible when evaluating the solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate high accuracy of ASK for solving one-, two-, and three-dimensional dynamical systems.",

Motivated by the issue of COVID-19 mitigation, in this work we tackle the general problem of optimally controlling an epidemic outbreak of a communicable disease structured by age since exposure, with the aid of two types of control instruments, namely social distancing and vaccination by a vaccine at least partly effective in protecting from infection. By our analyses we could prove the existence of (at least) one optimal control pair. We derived first-order necessary conditions for optimality and proved some useful properties of such optimal solutions. Our general model can be specialized to include a number of subcases relevant for epidemics like COVID-19, such as, e.g., the arrival of vaccines in a second stage of the epidemic, and vaccine rationing, making social distancing the only optimizable instrument.

We perform a rigorous derivation of the critical patch size associated with a 2-population glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model that divides the tumor cells into proliferating and quiescent/necrotic populations. We determine that the critical patch size of our model is consistent with that of the Fisherâ€“Kolmogorovâ€“Petrovskyâ€“Piskunov equation, one of the first reaction-diffusion models proposed for GBM, and does not depend on parameters pertaining to the quiescent/necrotic population. The critical patch size may indicate that GBM tumors have a minimum size depending on the location in the brain. We also derive a theoretical relationship between the size of a GBM tumor at steady-state and its maximum cell density, which has potential applications for patient-specific parameter estimation based on magnetic resonance imaging data. Finally, we identify a positively invariant region for our model, which guarantees that solutions remain positive and bounded from above for all time.",

Spatial systems with heterogeneities are ubiquitous in nature, from precipitation, temperature, and soil gradients controlling vegetation growth to morphogen gradients controlling gene expression in embryos. Such systems, generally described by nonlinear dynamical systems, often display complex parameter dependence and exhibit bifurcations. The dynamics of heterogeneous spatially extended systems passing through bifurcations are still relatively poorly understood, yet recent theoretical studies and experimental data highlight the resulting complex behaviors and their relevance to real-world applications. We explore the consequences of spatial heterogeneities passing through bifurcations via two examples strongly motivated by applications. These model systems illustrate that studying heterogeneity-induced behaviors in spatial systems is crucial for a better understanding of ecological transitions and functional organization in brain development.",

Inverse problems of recovering space-dependent parameters, e.g., initial condition, space-dependent source, or potential coefficient in a subdiffusion model from the terminal observation have been extensively studied in recent years. However, all existing studies have assumed that the terminal time at which one takes the observation is exactly known. In this work, we present uniqueness and stability results for three canonical inverse problems, e.g., backward problem, inverse source, and inverse potential problems from the terminal observation at an unknown time. The subdiffusive nature of the problem indicates that one can simultaneously determine the terminal time and space-dependent parameter. The analysis is based on explicit solution representations, asymptotic behavior of the Mittagâ€“Leffler function, and mild regularity conditions on the problem data. Further, we present several one- and two-dimensional numerical experiments to illustrate the feasibility of the approach.",

Alzheimerâ€™s disease, the most common form of dementia, is a systemic neurological disorder associated with the formation of toxic, pathological aggregates of proteins within the brain that lead to severe cognitive decline, and eventually, death. In normal physiological conditions, the brain rids itself of toxic proteins using various clearance mechanisms. The efficacy of brain clearance can be adversely affected by the presence of toxic proteins and is also known to decline with age. Motivated by recent findings, such as the connection between brain cerebrospinal fluid clearance and sleep, we propose a mathematical model coupling the progression of toxic proteins over the brainâ€™s structural network and protein clearance. The model is used to study the interplay between clearance in the brain, toxic seeding, brain network connectivity, aging, and progression in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for the growing body of medical research showing that clearance plays an important role in the etiology, progression, and treatment of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.",

The study of a receptor-ligand system generally relies on the analysis of its dose-response (or concentration-effect) curve, which quantifies the relation between ligand concentration and the biological effect (or cellular response) induced when binding its specific cell surface receptor. Mathematical models of receptor-ligand systems have been developed to compute a dose-response curve under the assumption that the biological effect is proportional to the number of ligand-bound receptors. Given a dose-response curve, two quantities (or metrics) have been defined to characterize the properties of the ligand-receptor system under consideration: amplitude and potency (or half-maximal effective concentration, and denoted by EC[mâ€¦",

Understanding and predicting the dynamical properties of systems involving dry friction is a major concern in physics and engineering. It abounds in many mechanical processes, from the sound produced by a violin to the screeching of chalk on a blackboard to human infant crawling dynamics and friction-based locomotion of a multitude of living organisms (snakes, bacteria, scallops) to the displacement of mechanical structures (building, bridges, nuclear plants, massive industrial infrastructures) under earthquakes and beyond. Surprisingly, even for low-dimensional systems, the modeling of dry friction in the presence of random forcing has not been elucidated. In this paper, we propose a piecewise deterministic Markov process approach modeling a system with dry friction including different coefficients for the static and dynamic forces. In this mathematical framework, we derive the corresponding Kolmogorov equations to compute statistical quantities of interest related to the distributions of the static (sticked) and dynamic phases. We show ergodicity and provide a representation formula of the stationary measure using independent identically distributed portions of the trajectory (excursions). We also obtain deterministic characterizations of the Laplace transforms of the probability density functions of the durations of the static and dynamic phases. In particular, the analysis of the power spectral density of the velocity reveals a critical value of the noise correlation time below which the correlations of the dynamic behaviors coincide with those of the white noise limit. The existence of such a critical value was already mentioned in the physical literature [Geffert and Just, Phys. Rev. E, 95 (2017), 062111].",
