          "description": "Abstract\nWe propose and analyze unfitted finite element approximations for the two-phase incompressible Navier–Stokes flow in an axisymmetric setting. The discretized schemes are based on an Eulerian weak formulation for the Navier–Stokes equation in the 2d-meridian halfplane, together with a parametric formulation for the generating curve of the evolving interface. We use lowest order Taylor–Hood and piecewise linear elements for discretizing the Navier–Stokes formulation in the bulk and the moving interface, respectively. We discuss a variety of schemes, amongst which is a linear scheme that enjoys an equidistribution property on the discrete interface and good volume conservation. An alternative scheme can be shown to be unconditionally stable and to conserve the volume of the two phases exactly. Numerical results are presented to show the robustness and accuracy of the introduced methods for simulating both rising bubble and oscillating droplet experiments.",

          "description": "Abstract\nSolving high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs) with the variational inference (VI) method is promising but still challenging. The main difficulties arise from two aspects. First, VI methods approximate the posterior distribution using a simple and analytic variational distribution, which makes it difficult to estimate complex spatially-varying parameters in practice. Second, VI methods typically rely on gradient-based optimization, which can be computationally expensive or intractable when applied to BIPs involving partial differential equations (PDEs). To address these challenges, we propose a novel approximation method for estimating the high-dimensional posterior distribution. This approach leverages a deep generative model to learn a prior model capable of generating spatially-varying parameters. This enables posterior approximation over the latent variable instead of the complex parameters, thus improving estimation accuracy. Moreover, to accelerate gradient computation, we employ a differentiable physics-constrained surrogate model to replace the adjoint method. The proposed method can be fully implemented in an automatic differentiation manner. Numerical examples demonstrate two types of log-permeability estimation for flow in heterogeneous media. The results show the validity, accuracy, and high efficiency of the proposed method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we study numerically several trace finite element methods for the Laplace–Beltrami eigenvalue problem on surfaces, including the original variant, a stabilized isoparametric element and a new method with exact geometric descriptions. The new variant is proposed directly on a smooth manifold which is implicitly given by a level-set function and require high order numerical quadrature on the surface. We show that without stabilization the eigenvalues of the discrete Laplace–Beltrami operator may coincide with only part of the eigenvalues of an embedded problem, which further corresponds to the finite eigenvalues for a singular generalized algebraic eigenvalue problem. The finite eigenvalues can be efficiently solved by a rank-completing perturbation algorithm in Hochstenbach et al. (SIAM J Matrix Anal Appl 40:1022–1046, 2019). We prove the new method has optimal convergence rate without considering the quadrature errors. The impact of the geometric consistency on the eigenvalue problem is carefully studied. Numerical experiments suggest that all the methods have optimal convergence rate while the geometric consistency can improve the numerical accuracy significantly.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe present two methods for the numerical solution of an overdetermined symmetric hyperbolic and thermodynamically compatible (SHTC) model of compressible two-phase flows which has the peculiar feature that it is endowed with two entropy inequalities as primary evolution equations. The total energy conservation law is an extra conservation law and is obtained via suitable linear combination of all other equations based on the Godunov variables (main field). In the stiff relaxation limit the SHTC model tends to an asymptotically reduced Baer–Nunziato-type (BN) limit system with a unique choice for the interface velocity and the interface pressure, including parabolic heat conduction terms and additional lift forces that are not present in standard BN models. Both numerical schemes directly discretize the two entropy inequalities, including the entropy production terms, and obtain total energy conservation as a consequence. The first method is of the finite volume type and makes use of a thermodynamically compatible flux recently introduced by Abgrall et al. that allows to fulfill an additional extra conservation law exactly at the discrete level. The scheme satisfies both entropy inequalities by construction and can be proven to be nonlinearly stable in the energy norm. The second scheme is a general purpose discontinuous Galerkin method that achieves thermodynamic compatibility merely via the direct solution of the underlying viscous regularization of the governing equations. We show computational results for several benchmark problems in one and two space dimensions, comparing the two methods with each other and with numerical results obtained for the asymptotically reduced BN limit system. We also investigate the influence of the lift forces.",

We leverage data-driven model discovery methods to determine governing equations for the emergent behavior of heterogeneous networked dynamical systems. Specifically, we consider networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators whose collective behavior approaches a limit cycle. Stable limit cycles are of interest in many biological applications, as they model self-sustained oscillations (e.g. heartbeats, chemical oscillations, neurons firing, circadian rhythm). For systems that display relaxation oscillations, our method automatically detects boundary (time) layer structures in the dynamics, fitting inner and outer solutions and matching them in a data-driven manner. We demonstrate the method on well-studied systems: the Rayleigh oscillator and the van der Pol oscillator. We then apply the mathematical framework to networks of semisynchronized Kuramoto, Rayleigh, Rössler, and FitzHugh–Nagumo oscillators, as well as heterogeneous combinations thereof, showing that the discovery of coarse-grained variables and dynamics can be accomplished with the proposed architecture.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems, Volume 22, Issue 3, Page 2624-2647, September 2023. \n Abstract. Traditional models of opinion dynamics, in which the nodes of a network change their opinions based on their interactions with neighboring nodes, consider how opinions evolve either on time-independent networks or on temporal networks with edges that follow Poisson statistics. Most such models are Markovian. However, in many real-life networks, interactions between individuals (and hence the edges of a network) follow non-Poisson processes and thus yield dynamics with memory-dependent effects. In this paper, we model opinion dynamics in which the entities of a temporal network interact and change their opinions via random social interactions. When the edges have non-Poisson interevent statistics, the corresponding opinion models have non-Markovian dynamics. We derive a family of opinion models that are induced by arbitrary waiting-time distributions (WTDs), and we illustrate a variety of induced opinion models from common WTDs (including Dirac delta distributions, exponential distributions, and heavy-tailed distributions). We analyze the convergence to consensus of these models and prove that homogeneous memory-dependent models of opinion dynamics in our framework always converge to the same steady state regardless of the WTD. We also conduct a numerical investigation of the effects of waiting-time distributions on both transient dynamics and steady states. We observe that models that are induced by heavy-tailed WTDs converge more slowly to a steady state than models that are induced by WTDs with light tails (or with compact support) and that entities with longer waiting times exert more influence on the mean opinion at steady state.",
