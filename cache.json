Humans and their native gut microbiota lack erythritol catabolic microorganisms to utilize erythritol as carbon source, which inspires us to engineer a model chassis that can respond and utilize erythritol for establishing wide applications in synthetic biology fields. Here, we successfully engineered Escherichia coli to respond and utilize erythritol as sole carbon source. First, a heterologous erythritol catabolic gene cluster from Ochrobactrum spp. enables E. coli to catabolize erythritol into erythrose-4-phosphate and flow into pentose-phosphate pathway. Second, we characterized an erythritol binding transcriptional repressor and its DNA binding site. Then, mRNA transcriptional analysis guided us to build up further metabolic engineering strategies for improving erythritol catabolism. Finally, such engineered E. coli strains were applied for in vitro simulated intestinal fluid experiments and performed as an erythritol detector to distinguish soda drinks. We anticipate erythritol catabolic E. coli strains will expand synthetic biology fields and accelerate applications in biomedical engineering and living therapeutics.",

Intending to address one of the central design principles of the Sc2.0 project, the ~190 kb tRNA neochromosome houses all 275 relocated nuclear tRNA genes. To maximize stability, the design incorporated orthogonal genetic elements from non-S. cerevisiae yeast species. Furthermore, the presence of 283 rox recombination sites enable an orthogonal SCRaMbLE system capable of adjusting tRNA abundance. Following construction, we obtained evidence of a potent selective force once the neochromosome was introduced into yeast cells, manifesting as a spontaneous doubling in cell ploidy. Furthermore, tRNA sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics, nucleosome mapping, replication profiling, FISH and Hi-C were undertaken to investigate questions of tRNA neochromosome behavior and function. Its construction demonstrates the remarkable tractability of the yeast model and opens up new opportunities to directly test hypotheses surrounding these essential non-coding RNAs.",

Here we reported a hybrid system, coupling chemical process of CO2 hydrogen reduction and biological process for polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis, that utilized CO2 as a raw material to produce PHB in vitro. The synthetic pathway of PHB was optimized by screening more efficient methanol oxidases, high activity mutants of glycolaldehyde synthase and coordinating enzyme dosages in the pathway, which achieved the carbon yield of 93.6% for producing PHB from methanol. Finally, by combining with the chemical process from CO2 to methanol, a scaling-up bio-system was performed to convert CO2 into PHB, yielding 5.8 g/L with the productivity of 1.06 g-1L-1h-1. This approach represents a promising carbon-neutral way to produce biodegradable plastics.",

For attL and attR to be recombined by the integrase, the presence of its cognate recombination directionality factor (RDF) is required. It is hypothesized that the RDF binds the coiled-coil domain of the integrase to accomplish this switch in recombination directionality. Yet, nothing is known about the site of interaction between the RDF and integrase. Here, we tried to identify the region on the coiled-coil domain of PhiC31 integrase to which its cognate RDF (gp3) might bind.

In this study, the biosynthetic pathway of cucurbitacin IIa was elucidated by characterization of squalene epoxidases (HcSE1, HcSE2), cucurbitenol synthases (HcOSC6) and acyltransferases (HcAT1) in Hemsleya chinensis. Meanwhile, cycloartenol synthases (HcOSC1), isomultiflorenol synthases (HcOSC5) and {beta}-amyrin synthase (HcOSC2-4) involved in sterol and triterpenes biosynthesis were functionally illustrated. The high-level production of yeast the key cucurbitacin precursor, cucurbitadienol, was constructed to produce 296.37 mg/L cucurbitadienol and 722.99 mg/L total triterpenoid which is the highest yield cucurbitadienol from known engineered microbes. Moreover, production of cucurbitenol in transient expression of tobacco was employed to achieve 94.8 mg/g dry weight (dw) cucurbitenol from leaves. In this study, the key genes involved in cucurbitacin IIa biosynthesis were identified to facilitate its medical applications via biosynthetic strategy. Meanwhile, the high-level production of cucurbitadienol chassis yeast and tobacco transient expression offered a robust and sSupplemental Table substrate for pharmaceutical cucurbitacin production and screening platform for candidate genes involved in cucurbitacin biosynthesis.",

While CRISPR-derived tools have shown great success in editing disease-driving genes in human cells, we currently lack the tools to achieve comparable success for bacterial targets. Here we engineer a phage-derived particle to deliver a base editor and modify E. coli colonizing the mouse gut. This was achieved using a non-replicative DNA payload, preventing maintenance and dissemination of the payload, while allowing for an editing efficiency of up to 99.7% of the target bacterial population. The editing of a {beta}-lactamase gene resulted in the stable maintenance of edited bacteria in the mouse gut at least 42 days after treatment. By enabling the in situ modification of bacteria directly in the gut, our approach offers a novel avenue to investigate the function of bacterial genes and provides an opportunity to develop novel microbiome-targeted therapies.",

          "description": "As one of the newest fields of engineering, synthetic biology relies upon a trial-and-error Design-Build-Test-Learn approach to simultaneously learn how function is encoded in biology and attempt to engineer it. Many software and hardware platforms have been developed to automate, optimize, and algorithmically perform each step of the Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle. However, there are many fewer options for automating the Build step. Build typically involves DNA assembly, which remains manual, low throughput, and unreliable in most cases, limiting our ability to advance the science and engineering of biology. Here, we present AssemblyTron: an open-source python package to integrate j5 DNA assembly design software outputs with build implementation in Opentrons liquid handling robotics with minimal human intervention. We demonstrate the versatility of AssemblyTron through several scarless, multipart DNA assemblies beginning from fragment amplification. We show that AssemblyTron can perform PCRs across a range of fragment lengths and annealing temperatures by using an optimal annealing temperature gradient calculation algorithm. We then demonstrate that AssemblyTron can perform Golden Gate and homology-dependent in vivo assemblies with comparable fidelity to manual assemblies by simultaneously building four four-fragment assemblies of chromoprotein reporter expression plasmids. Finally, we used AssemblyTron to perform site-directed mutagenesis reactions via homology-dependent in vivo assembly also achieving comparable fidelity to manual assemblies as assessed by sequencing. AssemblyTron can reduce the time, training, costs, and wastes associated with synthetic biology, which along with open-source and affordable automation, will further foster the accessibility of synthetic biology and accelerate biological research and engineering.",

This resource broadly enables cell-type independent interrogation and discovery of proteins from intracellular pathogens capable of binding phosphorylated human proteins.

On the other hand, it is the only carbon source that is scalable enough to establish a circular carbon economy. Accordingly, technologies to capture and convert CO2 to reduced one-carbon (C1) molecules (e.g. formate) using renewable energy are improving fast. Driven by the idea of creating sustainable bioproduction platforms, natural and synthetic C1-utilization pathways are engineered into industrially relevant microbes. The realization of synthetic C1-assimilation cycles in living organisms is a promising but challenging endeavour. Here, we engineer the autocatalytic serine threonine cycle, a synthetic C1-assimilation route in Escherichia coli. Our stepwise engineering approach in tailored selection strains combined with adaptive laboratory evolution experiments enabled the organism to grow on formate. The synthetic strain uses formate as the sole carbon and energy source and is capable of growing at ambient CO2 concentrations, demonstrating the feasibility of establishing synthetic C1-assimilation cycles over laboratory timescales.",

Here, we applied synthetic sRNA (sysRNA) to pinpoint RDT sites in vivo by exploiting its complementary base-pairing ability to target mRNA. Through the combined assays of rapid amplification of cDNA 3'-ends, primer extension, and capillary electrophoresis, we could precisely locate and quantify mRNA 3'-ends.

          "description": "Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science, Volume 32, Issue 9, September 2022. \nIn this paper, we propose a simplicial susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model with birth and death to describe epidemic spreading based on group interactions, accompanying with birth and death. The site-based evolutions are formulated by the quenched mean-field probability equations for each site, which is a high-dimensional differential system. To facilitate a theoretical analysis of the influence of system parameters on dynamics, we adopt the mean-field method for our model to reduce the dimension. As a consequence, it suggests that birth and death rates influence the existence and stability of equilibria, as well as the appearance of a bistable state (the coexistence of the stable disease-free and endemic states), which is then confirmed by extensive simulations on empirical and synthetic networks. Furthermore, we find that another type of the bistable state in which a stable periodic outbreak state coexists with a steady disease-free state also emerges when birth and death rates and other parameters satisfy the certain conditions. Finally, we illustrate how the birth and death rates shift the density of infected nodes in the stationary state and the outbreak threshold, which is also verified by sensitivity analysis for the proposed model.",

The distance threshold for recurrence is a crucial parameter influencing the observed recurrence structures, thus, the related quantification measures, and have been the object of several studies to find its optimal value. We suggest here a definition of recurrence based on the local attractor density to obtain more qualitative recurrence plots capturing the dynamics at different scales without suffering from variations in the tangential motion effect. The method is qualitatively and quantitatively compared with common thresholding methods on different signals. It is shown that the suggested recurrence plot has more uniform line structures and is less sensitive to the threshold parameter. We also present a modification enhancing its robustness to noise.",

The dynamics of the master layer depends solely on the distribution of the natural frequencies of its oscillators. On the other hand, the slave layer dynamics depends not only on the distribution of the natural frequencies of its oscillators but also on the unidirectional coupling with the master layer. The standard Kuramoto order parameter is used to study synchronization in the individual layers and of the bi-layer network. A transition to a completely mirroring state is observed in the dynamics of the slave layer, as the mirroring coefficient in the unidirectional coupling is increased. We derive analytically and verify numerically the conditions for the slave layer to fully mimic the synchronization properties of the master layer. It is further shown that while the master and slave layers are individually synchronized, the bi-layer network exhibits a state of frustrated synchronization.",

To achieve a stable DC output, the TEH is interfaced with a standard rectifier circuit. Using the harmonic balance method combined with the separation of fast and slow variables, a steady-state response together with the analytical expressions of displacement and harvested power is derived. The multi-solution feature in the amplitude–frequency response is observed and can improve the harvesting performance of the TEH under a low-frequency environment. There is an optimal time constant ratio and electromechanical coupled coefficient to maximize the harvested DC power. Meanwhile, the VR phenomenon of the TEH is explored through the response amplitude of the low-frequency input signal, which implies that an appropriate combination can induce the occurrence of VR and improve the rectified voltage. Similarly, the nonlinear stiffness coefficients can be adjusted by changing the magnet distance to induce the appearance of VR. The theoretical solutions are well supported by numerical simulation and experimental verification.

The analysis of the Casimir force in the limit of strong and weak magnetization shows that the attractive force, which is produced for plate magnetizations in the same direction, is greater than the repulsive force that is produced for opposite magnetizations. However, both forces remain comparable for intermediate magnetizations. Moreover, for weak magnetization, the attractive force becomes stronger for an increasing dielectric function, while the opposite occurs for the repulsive force. On the other hand, increasing magnetization decreases the influence of the dielectric function on both the repulsive and attractive forces. Furthermore, for conservative systems, bifurcation and phase portrait analysis revealed that increasing magnetization decreases the regime of stable operation for devices with attractive forces, while their operation remains always stable under the presence of repulsive forces. Finally, for non-conservative periodically driven systems, the Melnikov function and Poincaré portrait analysis show that for magnetizations in the same direction leading to strong attractive Casimir forces, chaotic motion toward stiction is highly likely to occur preventing the long-term prediction of actuating dynamics. A remedy for this situation is obtained by the application of any magnetization in opposite directions between the interacting surfaces since the repulsive force makes it possible to prevent stiction.",

Recent studies have shown that a constant density of reinforced nodes can prevent catastrophic network collapses. However, the effect of reinforcing dependency links in interdependent networks has rarely been addressed. Here, we develop a percolation model for studying interdependent networks by introducing a fraction of reinforced dependency links. We find that there is a minimum fraction of dependency links that need to be reinforced to prevent the network from abrupt transition, and it can serve as the boundary value to distinguish between the first- and second-order phase transitions of the network. We give both analytical and numerical solutions to the minimum fraction of reinforced dependency links for random and scale-free networks. Interestingly, it is found that the upper bound of this fraction is a constant 0.088 01 for two interdependent random networks regardless of the average degree. In particular, we find that the proposed method has higher reinforcement efficiency compared to the node-reinforced method, and its superiority in scale-free networks becomes more obvious as the coupling strength increases. Moreover, the heterogeneity of the network structure profoundly affects the reinforcement efficiency. These findings may provide several useful suggestions for designing more resilient interdependent networks.",

To search for possible epileptic biomarkers and to determine the epileptogenic zone that gives rise to seizures, we investigated the dynamics of basal and preictal signals. For this purpose, we explored the dynamics of the recorded time series for different frequency bands considering high-frequency oscillations (HFO) up to [math] Hz. We apply a Hilbert transform to study the amplitude and phase of the signals. The dynamics of the different frequency bands in the time causal entropy-complexity plane, [math], is characterized by comparing the dynamical evolution of the basal and preictal time series. As the preictal states evolve closer to the time in which the epileptic seizure starts, the, [math], dynamics changes for the higher frequency bands. The complexity evolves to very low values and the entropy becomes nearer to its maximal value. These quasi-stable states converge to equiprobable states when the entropy is maximal, and the complexity is zero. We could, therefore, speculate that in this case, it corresponds to the minimization of Gibbs free energy. In this case, the maximum entropy is equivalent to the principle of minimum consumption of resources in the system. We can interpret this as the nature of the system evolving temporally in the preictal state in such a way that the consumption of resources by the system is minimal for the amplitude in frequencies between 220–230 and 230–240 Hz.",

Currently, many countries vaccinate their population in descending order of age (i.e., descending order of fatality rate) to minimize the deaths caused by the disease; however, the effectiveness of this strategy needs to be quantitatively assessed. We employ the susceptible–infected–recovered–dead model to investigate various vaccination strategies. We constructed a metapopulation model with heterogeneous contact and fatality rates and investigated the effectiveness of vaccination strategies to reduce epidemic mortality. We found that the fatality-based strategy, which is currently employed in many countries, is more effective when the contagion rate is high and vaccine supply is low, but the contact-based method outperforms the fatality-based strategy when there is a sufficiently high supply of the vaccine. We identified a discontinuous transition of the optimal vaccination strategy and path-dependency analogous to hysteresis. This transition and path-dependency imply that combining the fatality-based and contact-based strategies is ineffective in reducing the number of deaths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such phenomena occur in real-world epidemic diseases, such as tuberculosis and COVID-19. We also show that the conclusions of this research are valid even when the complex epidemic stages, efficacy of the vaccine, and reinfection are considered.",

In contrast, many real-world chaotic phenomena, e.g., weather, arise in systems with many (formally infinite) degrees of freedom, which limits direct quantitative analysis of such systems using chaos theory. In the present work, we demonstrate that the hydrodynamic pilot-wave systems offer a bridge between low- and high-dimensional chaotic phenomena by allowing for a systematic study of how the former connects to the latter. Specifically, we present experimental results, which show the formation of low-dimensional chaotic attractors upon destabilization of regular dynamics and a final transition to high-dimensional chaos via the merging of distinct chaotic regions through a crisis bifurcation. Moreover, we show that the post-crisis dynamics of the system can be rationalized as consecutive scatterings from the nonattracting chaotic sets with lifetimes following exponential distributions.",

The numerical results are analyzed by the generalized method of master stability function (MSF), in which it is shown that whereas the method is able to predict the synchronization behaviors of the pinned oscillators, it fails to predict the synchronization behaviors of the unpinned oscillators. By checking the trajectories of the oscillators in the phase space, it is found that the failure is attributed to the deformed synchronization manifold of the unpinned oscillators, which is clearly deviated from that of isolated oscillator under strong pinnings. A similar phenomenon is also observed in the pinning control of cluster synchronization in a complex network of symmetric structures and in the self-organized cluster synchronization of networked neural oscillators. The findings are important complements to the generalized MSF method and provide an alternative approach to the manipulation of synchronization behaviors in complex network systems.",

Using an event-based approach, we reduce the system dynamics to a stochastic discrete map. For weak noise, we find that the oscillator fluctuates around a deterministic state, and we derive an autoregressive model describing the system dynamics. For stronger noise, the oscillator demonstrates noise-induced switching between various deterministic states; our theory provides a good estimate of the switching statistics in the linear limit. We show that the robustness of the system toward this switching is strikingly different depending on the type of noise. We compare the analytical results for linear coupling to numerical simulations of nonlinear coupling and find that the linear model also provides a qualitative explanation for the differences in robustness to both types of noise.

The optical wavefront emerging from a source point reaching a subject following passage through the optical system is, in general, a Gaussian surface with partial focus along the two principal directions of the Gaussian surface; i.e., there are two images of the source point, each with partial focus. As the source point moves, the images move on two surfaces, referred to as viewable surfaces. In our systems, one viewable surface consists of points with radial focus and the other consists of points with azimuthal focus. The problems we study are (1) imaging of a parallel beam of light, (2) imaging of the infinite viewed from a location outside the sphere, and (3) imaging of a planar object viewed through the point of its intersection with the radial line normal to the plane.

          "description": "Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science, Volume 32, Issue 9, September 2022. \nHigher-order interactions have significant implications for the dynamics of competing epidemic spreads. In this paper, a competing spread model for two simplicial irreversible epidemics (i.e., susceptible–infected–removed epidemics) on higher-order networks is proposed. The simplicial complexes are based on synthetic (including homogeneous and heterogeneous) and real-world networks. The spread process of two epidemics is theoretically analyzed by extending the microscopic Markov chain approach. When the two epidemics have the same 2-simplex infection rate and the 1-simplex infection rate of epidemic [math] ([math]) is fixed at zero, an increase in the 1-simplex infection rate of epidemic [math] ([math]) causes a transition from continuous growth to sharp growth in the spread of epidemic [math] with [math]. When [math], the growth of epidemic [math] is always continuous. With the increase of [math], the outbreak threshold of epidemic [math] is delayed. When the difference in 1-simplex infection rates between the two epidemics reaches approximately three times, the stronger side obviously dominates. Otherwise, the coexistence of the two epidemics is always observed. When the 1-simplex infection rates are symmetrical, the increase in competition will accelerate the spread process and expand the spread area of both epidemics; when the 1-simplex infection rates are asymmetrical, the spread area of one epidemic increases with an increase in the 1-simplex infection rate from this epidemic while the other decreases. Finally, the influence of 2-simplex infection rates on the competing spread is discussed. An increase in 2-simplex infection rates leads to sharp growth in one of the epidemics.",

First, we numerically resolve the eigenvalues under different control parameters utilizing the Fourier collocation method. Then, we simulate the evolution of this equation under the above initial conditions via the symmetrical split-step Fourier method. Moreover, we investigate the “steady” chaotic state by evolving a large number of initial conditions for the same control parameters. We find that the control parameters of the initial condition affect the number and intensity of rogue waves (RWs) in integrable turbulence. In particular, we locate the inflection point where the control parameter affects the velocities of solitons and the inconsistency within the parameter of the contribution to the generation of RWs.

Finding all symmetric nodes in large complex networks typically relies on automorphism groups from algebraic-group theory, which are solvable in quasipolynomial time. We articulate a conceptually appealing and computationally extremely efficient approach to finding and characterizing all symmetric nodes by introducing a structural position vector (SPV) for each node in networks. We establish the mathematical result that symmetric nodes must have the same SPV value and demonstrate, using six representative complex networks from the real world, that all symmetric nodes in these networks can be found in linear time. Furthermore, the SPVs not only characterize the similarity of nodes but also quantify the nodal influences in propagation dynamics. A caveat is that the proved mathematical result relating the SPV values to nodal symmetries is not sufficient; i.e., nodes having the same SPV values may not be symmetric, which arises in regular networks or networks with a dominant regular component. We point out with an analysis that this caveat is, in fact, shared by the known existing approaches to finding symmetric nodes in the literature. We further argue, with the aid of a mathematical analysis, that our SPV method is generally effective for finding the symmetric nodes in real-world networks that typically do not have a dominant regular component. Our SPV-based framework, therefore, provides a physically intuitive and computationally efficient way to uncover, understand, and exploit symmetric structures in complex networks arising from real-world applications.",

Here, we consider a generalization of the frustrated KS model that exhibits new transitions to synchronization. The model is identical in form to the original Kuramoto model but written in terms of unit vectors and with the coupling constant replaced by a coupling matrix. The matrix breaks the rotational symmetry and forces the order parameter to point in the direction of the eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue, when the eigenvalues are real. For complex eigenvalues, the module of order parameter oscillates while it rotates around the unit circle, creating active states. We derive the complete phase diagram for the Lorentzian distribution of frequencies using the Ott–Antonsen ansatz. We also show that changing the average value of the natural frequencies leads to further phase transitions where the module of the order parameter goes from oscillatory to static.",

Differentiating from traditional assumption of activator–inhibitor interactions in a spatially continuous domain, a Turing pattern in networked reaction-diffusion systems has received much attention during the past few decades. In spite of its great progress, it still fails to evaluate the precise influences of network topology on pattern formation. To this end, we try to promote the research on this important and interesting issue from the point of view of average degree—a critical topological feature of networks. We first qualitatively analyze the influence of average degree on pattern formation. Then, a quantitative relationship between pattern formation and average degree, the exponential decay of pattern formation, is proposed via nonlinear regression. The finding holds true for several activator–inhibitor systems including biology model, ecology model, and chemistry model. The significance of this study lies that the exponential decay not only quantitatively depicts the influence of average degree on pattern formation, but also provides the possibility for predicting and controlling pattern formation.",

The coupling exploits the potential difference between a catalyst redox couple in the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, without external feedback, to induce surface reactions that impact the kinetics of the bulk system. The effect of coupling in BZ oscillators under batch condition is characterized using phase synchronization measures. Although the frequency of the oscillators decreases nonlinearly over time, by a factor of 2 or more within 100 cycles, the coupling is strong enough to maintain synchronization. In such a highly drifting system, the Gibbs–Shannon entropy of the cyclic phase difference distribution can be used to quantify the coupling effect. We extend the Oregonator BZ model to account for the drifting natural frequencies in batch condition and for electrochemical coupling, and numerical simulations of the effect of acid concentration on synchronization patterns are in agreement with the experiments. Because of the passive nature of coupling, the proposed coupling scheme can open avenues for designing pattern recognition and neuromorphic computation systems using chemical reactions in a spontaneous process.",

However, previous group percolation models are always of a first-order phase transition, regardless of the group size distribution. This motivates us to investigate a generalized model for group percolation in interdependent networks with a reinforcement network layer to eliminate collapse. Some backup devices that are equipped for a density [math] of reinforced nodes constitute the reinforcement network layer. For each group, we assume that at least one node of the group can function in one network and a node in another network depends on the group to function. We find that increasing the density [math] of reinforcement nodes and the size [math] of the dependency group can significantly enhance the robustness of interdependent networks. Importantly, we find the existence of a hybrid phase transition behavior and propose a method for calculating the shift point of percolation types. The most interesting finding is the exact universal solution to the minimal density [math] of reinforced nodes (or the minimum group size [math]) to prevent abrupt collapse for Erdős–Rényi, scale-free, and regular random interdependent networks. Furthermore, we present the validity of the analytic solutions for a triple point [math] (or [math]), the corresponding phase transition point [math], and second-order phase transition points [math] in interdependent networks.

          "description": "Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science, Volume 32, Issue 9, September 2022. \nSupply-chain systems (SCSs) are an indispensable part of our daily infrastructures. Note that a small perturbation in a SCS can be amplified, eliciting cascading failures. It is of significant value to ensure a high resilience of SCSs. However, due to the complexity of SCSs, it is quite challenging to study their resilience under conditions of perturbations. In view of this, this paper presents a complex network perspective toward the resilience of SCSs. To achieve this goal, a complex SCS is modeled as a multilayer supply-chain network (SCN) with physical organizations being modeled as nodes and interactions among them as edges. A modeled SCN contains three types of nodes, i.e., suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers. An algorithm is proposed to construct a multilayer SCN. For each layer of a multilayer SCN, two kinds of networks, i.e., networks with Poisson degree distributions and networks with power-law degree distributions, are considered. For a given multilayer SCN, a ripple-effect network model is proposed to analyze its resilience under perturbations. Regarding the perturbations, two scenarios, i.e., random node failures and target node failures, are adopted in this research. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed network perspective, simulations on computer-generated SCNs are carried out. Interestingly, it is found that the resilience of SCNs under both random and target perturbations presents a discontinuous phase-change phenomenon, which indicates that SCNs are quite fragile under perturbations. It is further noticed that SCNs with power-law degree distributions are relatively more robust than SCNs with Poisson degree distributions. Although SCNs are found to be fragile, it has been discovered that denser interactions between different system organizations can enhance the network’s resilience.",

Specifically, consider Erdős–Rényi random graphs in which any two oscillators are bidirectionally coupled with unit strength, independently and at random, with probability [math]. We say that a network is globally synchronizing if the oscillators converge to the all-in-phase synchronous state for almost all initial conditions. Is there a critical threshold for [math] above which global synchrony is extremely likely but below which it is extremely rare? It is suspected that a critical threshold exists and is close to the so-called connectivity threshold, namely, [math] for [math]. Ling, Xu, and Bandeira made the first progress toward proving a result in this direction: they showed that if [math], then Erdős–Rényi networks of Kuramoto oscillators are globally synchronizing with high probability as [math]. Here, we improve that result by showing that [math] suffices. Our estimates are explicit: for example, we can say that there is more than a [math] chance that a random network with [math] and [math] is globally synchronizing.",

The self-organization process involves the formation of two types of patches, majority and minority ones, characterized by uniform average spiking frequencies. Patched patterns may be temporally periodic, quasiperiodic, or chaotic, whereby chaotic patterns may further develop interfaces comprised of units with average frequencies in between those of majority and minority patches. Using chaos and bifurcation theory, we demonstrate that chaos typically emerges via a torus breakup and identify the secondary bifurcation that gives rise to chaotic interfaces. It is shown that the maximal Lyapunov exponent of chaotic patched patterns does not decay, but rather converges to a finite value with system size. Patched patterns with a smaller wavenumber may exhibit diffusive motion of chaotic interfaces, similar to that of the incoherent part of chimeras.",

Unfortunately, the system faces inevitable perturbations of extreme events and is frequently damaged. To maintain the system's stability, recovering its damaged functionality is essential and is complementary to strengthening its resilience and forecasting extreme events. This paper proposes a target recovery method based on network and economic equilibrium theories to defend the economic system against perturbations characterized as localized attacks. This novel method stimulates a set of economic sectors that mutually reinforce damaged economic sectors and is intuitively named the target reinforcement path (TRP) method. Developing a nonlinear dynamic model that simulates the economic system's operation after being perturbed by a localized attack and recovering based on a target recovery method, we compute the relaxation time for this process to quantify the method's efficiency. Furthermore, we adopt a rank aggregation method to comprehensively measure the method's efficiency by studying the target recovery of three country-level economic systems (China, India, and Japan) for 73 different regional attack scenarios. Through a comparative analysis of the TRP method and three other classic methods, the TRP method is shown to be more effective and less costly. Applicatively, the proposed method exhibits the potential to recover other vital complex systems with spontaneous recovery ability, such as immune, neurological, and ecological systems.",

Understanding, recognizing, and predicting these HTEs and researching their occurrence rules provides theoretical and decision-making support for preventing system congestion. Communication sectors are regarded as nodes, and if HTEs occur synchronously among sectors, then the corresponding nodes are connected. The total number of synchronous HTEs determines the edge weights. The mobile-communication spatiotemporal data are mapped to a weighted network, with the occurrence locations of HTEs as the basic elements. Network analysis provides a structure for representing the interaction of HTEs. By analyzing the topological features of the event synchronization network, the associations among the occurrence times of HTEs can be mined. We find that the event synchronization network is a small-world network, the cumulative strength distribution is exponential, and the edge weight obeys a power law. Moreover, the node clustering coefficient is negatively correlated with the node degree. A congestion coefficient based on several topological parameters is proposed, and the system congestion is visualized. The congestion coefficient contains information about the synchronous occurrence of HTEs between a sector and its neighbors and information about the synchronous occurrence of HTEs among its neighbors. For the mobile communication system considered in this study, the congestion coefficient of a large number of sectors is small and the risk of system congestion is low.",

Expansion of meristematic tissue is derived from the growth and division of stem cells that reside in a central zone of the SAM. This reservoir of stem cells is maintained by expression of a transcription factor WUSCHEL that is responsible for the development of stem cells in the central zone. WUSCHEL expression is self-activating and downregulated by a signaling pathway initiated by CLAVATA proteins, which are upregulated by WUSCHEL. This classic activator–inhibitor network can generate localized patterns of WUSCHEL activity by a Turing instability provided certain constraints on reaction rates and diffusion constants of WUSCHEL and CLAVATA are satisfied, and most existing mathematical models of nucleation and confinement of stem cells in the SAM rely on Turing's mechanism. However, Turing patterns have certain properties that are inconsistent with observed patterns of stem cell differentiation in the SAM. As an alternative mechanism, we propose a model for stem cell confinement based on a bistable-switch in WUSCHEL–CLAVATA interactions. We study the bistable-switch mechanism for pattern formation in a spatially continuous domain and in a discrete cellularized tissue in the presence of a non-uniform field of a rapidly diffusing hormone. By comparing domain formation by Turing and bistable-switch mechanisms in these contexts, we show that bistable switching provides a superior account of nucleation and confinement of the stem cell domain under reasonable assumptions on reaction rates and diffusion constants.",

The correlation and diffusion properties of this random motion are fully characterized by its index of self-similarity or the Hurst exponent. However, recent single-particle tracking experiments in biological cells revealed highly complicated anomalous diffusion phenomena that cannot be attributed to a class of self-similar random processes. Inspired by these observations, we here study the process that preserves the properties of the fractional Brownian motion at a single trajectory level; however, the Hurst index randomly changes from trajectory to trajectory. We provide a general mathematical framework for analytical, numerical, and statistical analysis of the fractional Brownian motion with the random Hurst exponent. The explicit formulas for probability density function, mean-squared displacement, and autocovariance function of the increments are presented for three generic distributions of the Hurst exponent, namely, two-point, uniform, and beta distributions. The important features of the process studied here are accelerating diffusion and persistence transition, which we demonstrate analytically and numerically.",

The concept of lobe dynamics admits exact and unique geometric demarcation of this region and, inherently, distinction of the portions of chaotic seas with essentially linear vs nonlinear Lagrangian transport. This, furthermore, admits explicit establishment of a topological equivalence between the (embedded) Hamiltonian structure of the Lagrangian dynamics in 2D (3D) flows and their canonical form. The linear transport region in physical space encompasses four adjacent subregions that each corresponds to one of the four quadrants in canonical space and may exchange material with their environment in two essentially nonlinear ways. First, exchange between quadrants within the linear transport region and, second, exchange with the exterior of this region. Both forms of exchange can be linked to specific subsets of material elements defined by interacting lobes and combined give rise to circulation through the quadrants of the linear transport region that systematically exchanges the material with the exterior.",

We explain this phenomenon by means of bifurcation analysis of a three-dimensional Poincaré map for the system under consideration. We show that chaotic dynamics develop here near a codimension three bifurcation, when a periodic orbit (fixed point of the Poincaré map) has the triplet of multipliers [math]. As it is known, the flow normal form for such bifurcation is the well-known three-dimensional Arneodó–Coullet–Spiegel–Tresser (ACST) system, which exhibits spiral attractors.

Therefore, we describe an alternative method based on persistent homology—a tool from topological data analysis—that utilizes Betti numbers and CROCKER plots. Betti numbers are topological invariants of topological spaces, while the CROCKER plot is a coarsened but easy to visualize data representation of a one-parameter varying family of persistence barcodes. The specific bifurcations we investigate are transitions from periodic to chaotic behavior or vice versa in a one-parameter collection of differential equations. We validate our methods using numerical experiments on ten dynamical systems and contrast the results with existing tools that use the maximum Lyapunov exponent. We further prove the relationship between the Wasserstein distance to the empty diagram and the norm of the Betti vector, which shows that an even more simplified version of the information has the potential to provide insight into the bifurcation parameter. The results show that our approach reveals more information about the shape of the periodic attractor than standard tools, and it has more favorable computational time in comparison with the Rösenstein algorithm for computing the maximum Lyapunov exponent.",

However, the input of the emotion recognition model is often a whole set of EEG channels obtained by electrodes placed on subjects. The unnecessary information produced by redundant channels affects the recognition rate and depletes computing resources, thereby hindering the practical applications of emotion recognition. In this work, we aim to optimize the input of EEG channels using a visibility graph (VG) and genetic algorithm-based convolutional neural network (GA-CNN). First, we design an experiment to evoke three types of emotion states using movies and collect the multi-channel EEG signals of each subject under different emotion states. Then, we construct VGs for each EEG channel and derive nonlinear features representing each EEG channel. We employ the genetic algorithm (GA) to find the optimal subset of EEG channels for emotion recognition and use the recognition results of the CNN as fitness values. The experimental results show that the recognition performance of the proposed method using a subset of EEG channels is superior to that of the CNN using all channels for each subject. Last, based on the subset of EEG channels searched by the GA-CNN, we perform cross-subject emotion recognition tasks employing leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in recognizing emotion states using fewer EEG channels and further enrich the methods of EEG classification using nonlinear features.",

At first, a new asymmetric branch separates from the fundamental symmetric soliton at the first power critical point, and then, the asymmetric branch passes through the branch of the fundamental symmetric soliton and finally merges into the branch of the fundamental symmetric soliton at the second power critical point, while the power of the soliton increases. This leads to the symmetry breaking and double-loop bifurcation of fundamental symmetric solitons. From the power-propagation constant curves of solitons, symmetric fundamental and tripole solitons, asymmetric solitons can also exist. The stability of symmetric fundamental solitons, asymmetric solitons, and symmetric tripole solitons is discussed by the linear stability analysis and direct simulation. Results indicate that symmetric fundamental solitons and symmetric tripole solitons tend to be stable with the increase in the soliton power. Asymmetric solitons are unstable in both high and low power regions. Moreover, with the increase in saturable nonlinearity, the stability region of fundamental symmetric solitons and symmetric tripole solitons becomes wider.",

This model describes nonparaxial ultrashort pulse propagation in an optical medium in the presence of spatial dispersion originating from the failure of slowly varying envelope approximation. We show that this system admits periodic (elliptic) solitary waves with a dipole structure within a period and also a transition from a dipole to quadrupole structure within a period depending on the value of the modulus parameter of a Jacobi elliptic function. The parametric conditions to be satisfied for the existence of these solutions are given. The effect of the nonparaxial parameter on physical quantities, such as amplitude, pulse width, and speed of the solitary waves, is examined. It is found that by adjusting the nonparaxial parameter, the speed of solitary waves can be decelerated. The stability and robustness of the solitary waves are discussed numerically.",

This aspect has been studied intensively in social dilemmas where competing players’ individual and collective interests are in conflict. Starting from the traditional public goods game model, where players are locally fixed and unconditional cooperators or defectors are present, we introduce two additional strategies through which agents can change their positions of dependence on the local cooperation level. More importantly, these so-called sophisticated players should bear an extra cost to maintain their permanent capacity to evaluate their neighborhood and react accordingly. Hence, four strategies compete, and the most successful one can be imitated by its neighbors. Crucially, the introduction of costly movement has a highly biased consequence on the competing main strategies. In the majority of parameter space, it is harmful to defectors and provides a significantly higher cooperation level when the population is rare. At an intermediate population density, which would be otherwise optimal for a system of immobile players, the presence of mobile actors could be detrimental if the interaction pattern changes slightly, thereby blocking the optimal percolation of information flow. In this parameter space, sophisticated cooperators can also show the co-called Moor effect by first avoiding the harmful vicinity of defectors; they subsequently transform into an immobile cooperator state. Hence, paradoxically, the additional cost of movement could be advantageous to reach a higher general income, especially for a rare population when subgroups would be isolated otherwise.",

However, the symmetries of globally and identically coupled identical units do not allow solutions where distinct oscillators are frequency-unlocked—a necessary condition for the emergence of chimeras. Thus, forced symmetry breaking is necessary to observe chimera-type solutions. Here, we consider the bifurcations that arise when full permutational symmetry is broken for the network to consist of coupled populations. We consider the smallest possible network composed of four phase oscillators and elucidate the phase space structure, (partial) integrability for some parameter values, and how the bifurcations away from full symmetry lead to frequency-unlocked weak chimera solutions. Since such solutions wind around a torus they must arise in a global bifurcation scenario. Moreover, periodic weak chimeras undergo a period-doubling cascade leading to chaos. The resulting chaotic dynamics with distinct frequencies do not rely on amplitude variation and arise in the smallest networks that support chaos.",

The model takes into account the three substrate inflowing concentrations, as well as maintenance, that is, decay terms of the species. The operating diagrams give the asymptotic behavior of the model with respect to the four operating parameters, which are the dilution rate and the three inflowing concentrations of the substrates. These diagrams were obtained only numerically in the existing literature. Using the mathematical analysis of this model obtained in our previous studies, we construct the operating diagrams, by plotting the curves that separate their various regions. Hence, the regions of the operating diagrams are constructed analytically and there is no requirement for time-consuming algorithms to generate the plots, as in the numerical method. Moreover, our method reveals behaviors that have not been detected in the previous numerical studies. The growth functions are of Monod form with the inclusion of a product inhibition term. However, our method applies for a large class of growth functions. We construct operating diagrams with and without maintenance showing the role of maintenance on the stability of the system.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe present a unifying, tractable approach for studying the spread of viruses causing complex diseases requiring to be modeled using a large number of types (e.g., infective stage, clinical state, risk factor class). We show that recording each infected individual’s infection age, i.e., the time elapsed since infection, has three benefits. First, regardless of the number of types, the age distribution of the population can be described by means of a first-order, one-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE) known as the McKendrick-von Foerster equation. The frequency of type i is simply obtained by integrating the probability of being in state i at a given age against the age distribution. This representation induces a simple methodology based on the additional assumption of Poisson sampling to infer and forecast the epidemic. We illustrate this technique using French data from the COVID-19 epidemic. Second, our approach generalizes and simplifies standard compartmental models using high-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to account for disease complexity. We show that such models can always be rewritten in our framework, thus, providing a low-dimensional yet equivalent representation of these complex models. Third, beyond the simplicity of the approach, we show that our population model naturally appears as a universal scaling limit of a large class of fully stochastic individual-based epidemic models, where the initial condition of the PDE emerges as the limiting age structure of an exponentially growing population starting from a single individual.",

It is a well-recognised challenge to understand the effects of noise on the stability of such networks. We demonstrate that the patterns of activity generated by networks of grid cells emerge from the instability of homogeneous activity for small levels of noise. This is carried out by analysing the robustness of network activity patterns with respect to noise in an upscaled noisy grid cell model in the form of a system of partial differential equations. Inhomogeneous network patterns are numerically understood as branches bifurcating from unstable homogeneous states for small noise levels. We show that there is a phase transition occurring as the level of noise decreases.

          "description": "Abstract\nThe estimation from available data of parameters governing epidemics is a major challenge. In addition to usual issues (data often incomplete and noisy), epidemics of the same nature may be observed in several places or over different periods. The resulting possible inter-epidemic variability is rarely explicitly considered. Here, we propose to tackle multiple epidemics through a unique model incorporating a stochastic representation for each epidemic and to jointly estimate its parameters from noisy and partial observations. By building on a previous work for prevalence data, a Gaussian state-space model is extended to a model with mixed effects on the parameters describing simultaneously several epidemics and their observation process. An appropriate inference method is developed, by coupling the SAEM algorithm with Kalman-type filtering. Moreover, we consider here incidence data, which requires to develop a new version of the filtering algorithm. Its performances are investigated on SIR simulated epidemics for prevalence and incidence data. Our method outperforms an inference method separately processing each dataset. An application to SEIR influenza outbreaks in France over several years using incidence data is also carried out. Parameter estimations highlight a non-negligible variability between influenza seasons, both in transmission and case reporting. The main contribution of our study is to rigorously and explicitly account for the inter-epidemic variability between multiple outbreaks, both from the viewpoint of modeling and inference with a parsimonious statistical model.",

These fronts are shown to be linear combinations of exponentially decaying solutions to the linear system near the unstable state.

          "description": "Abstract\nIdentifying early warning signs of sudden population changes and mechanisms leading to regime shifts are highly desirable in population biology. In this paper, a two-trophic ecosystem comprising of two species of predators, competing for their common prey, with explicit interference competition is considered. With proper rescaling, the model is portrayed as a singularly perturbed system with fast prey dynamics and slow dynamics of the predators. In a parameter regime near singular Hopf bifurcation, chaotic mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs), featuring concatenation of small and large amplitude oscillations are observed as long-lasting transients before the system approaches its asymptotic state. To analyze the dynamical cause that initiates a large amplitude oscillation in an MMO orbit, the model is reduced to a suitable normal form near the singular-Hopf point. The normal form possesses a separatrix surface that separates two different types of oscillations. A large amplitude oscillation is initiated if a trajectory moves from the “inner” to the “outer side” of this surface. A set of conditions on the normal form variables are obtained to determine whether a trajectory would exhibit another cycle of MMO dynamics before experiencing a regime shift (i.e. approaching its asymptotic state). These conditions serve as early warning signs for a sudden population shift as well as detect the onset of a regime shift in this ecological model.",

          "description": "Abstract\nRandomized trials of infectious disease interventions, such as vaccines, often focus on groups of connected or potentially interacting individuals. When the pathogen of interest is transmissible between study subjects, interference may occur: individual infection outcomes may depend on treatments received by others. Epidemiologists have defined the primary parameter of interest—called the “susceptibility effect”—as a contrast in infection risk under treatment versus no treatment, while holding exposure to infectiousness constant. A related quantity—the “direct effect”—is defined as an unconditional contrast between the infection risk under treatment versus no treatment. The purpose of this paper is to show that under a widely recommended randomization design, the direct effect may fail to recover the sign of the true susceptibility effect of the intervention in a randomized trial when outcomes are contagious. The analytical approach uses structural features of infectious disease transmission to define the susceptibility effect. A new probabilistic coupling argument reveals stochastic dominance relations between potential infection outcomes under different treatment allocations. The results suggest that estimating the direct effect under randomization may provide misleading conclusions about the effect of an intervention—such as a vaccine—when outcomes are contagious. Investigators who estimate the direct effect may wrongly conclude an intervention that protects treated individuals from infection is harmful, or that a harmful treatment is beneficial.",

In practice, it is of substantial interest to estimate the model parameters based on noisy observations early in the outbreak, well before the epidemic reaches its peak. This allows prediction of the subsequent course of the epidemic and design of appropriate interventions. However, accurately inferring SIR model parameters in such scenarios is problematic. This article provides novel, theoretical insight on this issue of practical identifiability of the SIR model. Our theory provides new understanding of the inferential limits of routinely used epidemic models and provides a valuable addition to current simulate-and-check methods.

Plant–herbivore interactions are often described by using discrete-time models in the case of non-overlapping generations: such generations have some specific time interval of life and their old generations are replaced by new generations after some regular interval of time. Keeping in mind the dynamical reliability of continuous-time models we presented two discrete-time plant–herbivore models. Mainly, by applying Euler’s forward method a discrete-time plant–herbivore model is obtained from a continuous-time plant–herbivore model. In addition, a dynamically consistent discrete-time plant–herbivore model is obtained by applying a nonstandard difference scheme. Moreover, local stability is discussed and the existence of bifurcation about positive equilibrium is shown under some mathematical conditions. To control bifurcation and chaos, a modified hybrid technique is developed. Finally, to support our theocratical results and to show the dynamical reliability of the nonstandard difference scheme some numerical examples are provided.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe consider the problem of assessing the sensitivity of uncertain biochemical systems in the presence of input perturbations (either constant or periodic) around a stable steady state. \n\n       In particular, we propose approaches for the robust sensitivity analysis of systems with uncertain parameters assumed to take values in a hyper-rectangle. We highlight vertex results, which allow us to check whether a property is satisfied for all parameter choices in the hyper-rectangle by simply checking whether it is satisfied for all parameter choices at the vertices of the hyper-rectangle. We show that, for a vast class of systems, including (bio)chemical reaction networks with mass-action kinetics, the system Jacobian has a totally multiaffine structure (namely, all minors of the Jacobian matrix are multiaffine functions of the uncertain parameters), which can be exploited to obtain several vertex results. We consider different problems: robust non-singularity; robust stability of the steady-state; robust steady-state sensitivity analysis, in the case of constant perturbations; robust frequency-response sensitivity analysis, in the presence of periodic perturbations; and robust adaptation analysis. The developed theory is then applied to gain insight into some examples of uncertain biochemical systems, including the incoherent feed-forward loop, the coherent feed-forward loop, the Brusselator oscillator and the Goldbeter oscillator.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe introduce a model in the context of ecology that can be used to describe the distribution and abundance of individuals when data from field work is extremely limited (for example, in the case of endangered species). Our procedure is based on an intuitive understanding of the physical properties of phenomena. The idea is that individuals have the tendency to be attracted (or repulsed) to certain properties of the environment. At the same time, they are spread in such a way that if there is no reason for them to be in some specific locations, then they are uniformly distributed throughout the region. Our model draws from quantum mechanics, by using quantum Hamiltonians in the context of classical statistical mechanics. The equilibrium between the spreading and the attractive (or repulsive) forces determines the behavior of the species that we model, and this is expressed in terms of a global control problem of an energy operator which is the sum of a kinetic term (spreading) and a potential (attraction or repulsion). We focus on the full probability measure and a global control of the model (instead of looking at conditional measures that generate a global measure). Furthermore, we propose a numerical solution to this global control problem that overcomes the well-known major difficulty of Gibbs sampling (annealing) which is the fact that a global control is hardly reachable when the number of variables is large (the algorithms get stuck in non-optimal states).",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe consider a forager diffusing via a fractional heat equation and we introduce several efficiency functionals whose optimality is discussed in relation to the Lévy exponent of the evolution equation. Several biological scenarios, such as a target close to the forager, a sparse environment, a target located away from the forager and two targets are specifically taken into account. The optimal strategies of each of these configurations are here analyzed explicitly also with the aid of some special functions of classical flavor and the results are confronted with the existing paradigms of the Lévy foraging hypothesis. Interestingly, one discovers bifurcation phenomena in which a sudden switch occurs between an optimal (but somehow unreliable) Lévy foraging pattern of inverse square law type and a less ideal (but somehow more secure) classical Brownian motion strategy. Additionally, optimal foraging strategies can be detected in the vicinity of the Brownian one even in cases in which the Brownian one is pessimizing an efficiency functional.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe SIR (susceptible-infectious-recovered) model is a well known method for predicting the number of people (or animals) in a population who become infected by and then recover from a disease. Modifications can include categories such people who have been exposed to the disease but are not yet infectious or those who die from the disease. However, the model has nearly always been applied to the entire population of a country or state but there is considerable observational evidence that diseases can spread at different rates in densely populated urban regions and sparsely populated rural areas. This work presents a new approach that applies a SIR type model to a country or state that has been divided into a number of geographical regions, and uses different infection rates in each region which depend on the population density in that region. Further, the model contains a simple matrix based method for simulating the movement of people between different regions. The model is applied to the spread of disease in the United Kingdom and the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil.",

          "description": "Abstract\nPolyploidization, whereby an organism inherits multiple copies of the genome of their parents, is an important evolutionary event that has been observed in plants and animals. One way to study such events is in terms of the ploidy number of the species that make up a dataset of interest. It is therefore natural to ask: How much information about the evolutionary past of the set of species that form a dataset can be gleaned from the ploidy numbers of the species? To help answer this question, we introduce and study the novel concept of a ploidy profile which allows us to formalize it in terms of a multiplicity vector indexed by the species the dataset is comprised of. Using the framework of a phylogenetic network, we present a closed formula for computing the hybrid number (i.e. the minimal number of polyploidization events required to explain a ploidy profile) of a large class of ploidy profiles. This formula relies on the construction of a certain phylogenetic network from the simplification sequence of a ploidy profile and the hybrid number of the ploidy profile with which this construction is initialized. Both of them can be computed easily in case the ploidy numbers that make up the ploidy profile are not too large. To help illustrate the applicability of our approach, we apply it to a simplified version of a publicly available Viola dataset.",

          "description": "Abstract\nInvasive pest establishment is a pervasive threat to global ecosystems, agriculture, and public health. The recent establishment of the invasive spotted lanternfly in the northeastern United States has proven devastating to farms and vineyards, necessitating urgent development of population dynamical models and effective control practices. In this paper, we propose a stage-age-structured system of PDEs to model insect pest populations, in which underlying dynamics are dictated by ambient temperature through rates of development, fecundity, and mortality. The model incorporates diapause and non-diapause pathways, and is calibrated to experimental and field data on the spotted lanternfly. We develop a novel moving mesh method for capturing age-advection accurately, even for coarse discretization parameters. We define a one-year reproductive number (\n                      \n                      \\(R_0\\)\n                      \n                    ) from the spectrum of a one-year solution operator, and study its sensitivity to variations in the mean and amplitude of the annual temperature profile.

          "description": "Abstract\nWe propose a mathematical model, namely a reaction–diffusion system, to describe social behaviour of cockroaches. An essential new aspect in our model is that the dispersion behaviour due to overcrowding effect is taken into account as a counterpart to commonly studied aggregation. This consideration leads to an intriguing new phenomenon which has not been observed in the literature. Namely, due to the competition between aggregation towards areas of higher concentration of pheromone and dispersion avoiding overcrowded areas, the cockroaches aggregate more at the transition area of pheromone. Moreover, we also consider the fast reaction limit where the switching rate between active and inactive subpopulations tends to infinity. By utilising improved duality and energy methods, together with the regularisation of heat operator, we prove that the weak solution of the reaction–diffusion system converges to that of a reaction-cross-diffusion system.",

An individual can adopt either cooperation or defection as strategy and the population is updated from one time step to the next by a birth-death event according to a Moran model. Assuming recurrent symmetric mutation and payoffs to cooperators and defectors according to the composition of the group whose expected values, variances, and covariances are of the same small order, we derive a first-order approximation for the average abundance of cooperation in the selection-mutation equilibrium. In general, we show that increasing the variance of any payoff for defection or decreasing the variance of any payoff for cooperation increases the average abundance of cooperation. As for the effect of the covariance between any payoff for cooperation and any payoff for defection, we show that it depends on the number of cooperators in the group associated with these payoffs. We study in particular the public goods game, the stag hunt game, and the snowdrift game, all social dilemmas based on random benefit b and random cost c for cooperation, which lead to correlated payoffs to cooperators and defectors within groups. We show that a decrease in the scaled variance of b or c, or an increase in their scaled covariance, makes it easier for weak selection to favor the abundance of cooperation in the stag hunt game and the snowdrift game. The same conclusion holds for the public goods game except that the variance of b has no effect on the average abundance of C. Moreover, while the mutation rate has little effect on which strategy is more abundant at equilibrium, the group size may change it at least in the stag hunt game with a larger group size making it more difficult for cooperation to be more abundant than defection under weak selection.",

          "description": "Abstract\nAutocatalysis underlies the ability of chemical and biochemical systems to replicate. Recently, Blokhuis et al. (PNAS 117(41):25230–25236, 2020) gave a stoechiometric definition of autocatalysis for reaction networks, stating the existence of a combination of reactions such that the balance for all autocatalytic species is strictly positive, and investigated minimal autocatalytic networks, called autocatalytic cores. By contrast, spontaneous autocatalysis—namely, exponential amplification of all species internal to a reaction network, starting from a diluted regime, i.e. low concentrations—is a dynamical property. We introduce here a topological condition (Top) for autocatalysis, namely: restricting the reaction network description to highly diluted species, we assume existence of a strongly connected component possessing at least one reaction with multiple products (including multiple copies of a single species). We find this condition to be necessary and sufficient for stoechiometric autocatalysis. When degradation reactions have small enough rates, the topological condition further ensures dynamical autocatalysis, characterized by a strictly positive Lyapunov exponent giving the instantaneous exponential growth rate of the system. The proof is generally based on the study of auxiliary Markov chains. We provide as examples general autocatalytic cores of Type I and Type III in the typology of Blokhuis et al. (PNAS 117(41):25230–25236, 2020) . In a companion article (Unterberger in Dynamical autocatalysis for autocatalytic cores, 2021), Lyapunov exponents and the behavior in the growth regime are studied quantitatively beyond the present diluted regime .",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper we consider a partially augmented fully-mixed variational formulation that has been recently proposed for the coupling of the stationary Brinkman–Forchheimer and double-diffusion equations, and develop an a posteriori error analysis for the 2D and 3D versions of the associated mixed finite element scheme. Indeed, we derive two reliable and efficient residual-based a posteriori error estimators for this problem on arbitrary (convex or non-convex) polygonal and polyhedral regions. The reliability of the proposed estimators draws mainly upon the uniform ellipticity and inf-sup condition of the forms involved, a suitable assumption on the data, stable Helmholtz decompositions in Hilbert and Banach frameworks, and the local approximation properties of the Clément and Raviart–Thomas operators. In turn, inverse inequalities, the localization technique based on bubble functions, and known results from previous works, are the main tools yielding the efficiency estimate. Finally, several numerical examples confirming the theoretical properties of the estimators and illustrating the performance of the associated adaptive algorithms, are reported. In particular, the case of flow through a 3D porous media with channel networks is considered.",

          "description": "Abstract\nMulti-dimensional image recovery from incomplete data is a fundamental problem in data processing. Due to its advantage of capturing the correlations between any modes of the multi-dimensional image, i.e., the target tensor, the fully-connected tensor network (FCTN) decomposition has recently shown promising performance on multi-dimensional image recovery. However, FCTN decomposition suffers from computational deficiency, especially for large-scale multi-dimensional images. To address this deficiency, we propose a learnable transform-based FCTN model (termed as T-FCTN), which enjoys the remarkable advantage of FCTN decomposition with cheap computational cost. More concretely, we learn the semi-orthogonal transforms along each mode of the target tensor to project the large-scale te…",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe purpose of this work is to describe in detail the development of the spectral difference Raviart–Thomas (SDRT) formulation for two and three-dimensional tensor-product elements and simplexes. Through the process, the authors establish the equivalence between the SDRT method and the flux reconstruction (FR) approach under the assumption of the linearity of the flux and the mesh uniformity. Such a connection allows building a new family of FR schemes for two and three-dimensional simplexes and also to recover the well-known FR-SD method with tensor-product elements. In addition, a thorough analysis of the numerical dissipation and dispersion of both aforementioned schemes and the nodal discontinuous Galerkin FR (FR-DG) method with two and three-dimensional elements is proposed through the use of the combined-mode Fourier approach. SDRT is shown to possess an enhanced temporal linear stability in comparison to FR-DG. On the contrary, SDRT displays larger dissipation and dispersion errors with respect to FR-DG. Finally, the study is concluded with a set of numerical experiments, the linear advection-diffusion problem, the Isentropic Euler Vortex, and the Taylor-Green Vortex (TGV). The latter test case shows that SDRT schemes present a non-linear unstable behavior with simplex elements and certain polynomial degrees. For the sake of completeness, the matrix form of the SDRT method is developed and the computational performance of SDRT with respect to FR schemes is evaluated using GPU architectures.",

          "description": "Abstract\nMatrix and tensor nuclear norms have been successfully used to promote the low-rankness of tensors in low-rank tensor completion. However, singular value decomposition (SVD), which is computationally expensive for large-scale matrices, frequently appears in solving those nuclear norm minimization models. Based on the tensor-tensor product (T-product), in this paper, we first establish the equivalence between the so-called transformed tubal nuclear norm for a third-order tensor and the minimum of the sum of two factor tensors’ squared Frobenius norms under a general invertible linear transform. Gainfully, we introduce a mode-unfolding (often named as “spatio-temporal” in the internet traffic data recovery literature) regularized tensor completion model that is able to efficiently exploit the hidden structures of tensors. Then, we propose an implementable alternating minimization algorithm to solve the underlying optimization model. It is remarkable that our approach does not require any SVDs and all subproblems of our algorithm enjoy closed-form solutions. A series of numerical experiments on traffic data recovery, color images and videos inpainting demonstrate that our SVD-free approach takes less computing time to achieve satisfactory accuracy than some state-of-the-art tensor nuclear norm minimization approaches.",

To improve the temporal accuracy, the semi-implicit spectral deferred correction (SDC) method is adapted iteratively.

          "description": "Abstract\nSixth-order compact difference schemes for Poisson equations have been widely investigated in the literature. Nevertheless, those methods are all constructed based on knowing the exact values of the derivatives of the source term. Therefore, this drawback mostly prevents their actual applications as the analytic form of the source term is rarely available. In this paper, we propose a sixth-order quasi-compact difference method, without having to know the derivatives of the source term, for solving the 2D and 3D Poisson equations. Our strategy is to discretize the equation by the fourth-order compact scheme at the improper interior grid points that adjoin the boundary, while the sixth-order scheme, where it is compact only for the unknowns, is exploited to the proper interior grid points that are not adjoining the boundary. Theoretically, we rigorously prove that the proposed method can achieve the global sixth-order accuracy. Since there are no derivatives of the source term involved in the proposed scheme, our global sixth-order quasi-compact difference method can be developed to solve the time-dependent problems using a time advancing scheme. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the convergence order and the efficiency of the proposed methods.",

          "description": "Abstract\nAdaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and wavelet-based multi-resolution technique, which refine the spatial resolution in regions of interest and coarsen the mesh in other regions, are widely used in scientific computing for higher computational efficiency. The key component of AMR and the multi-resolution method is the adaptation strategy including the regularity estimation. In this paper, a new adaptation strategy for AMR and the multi-resolution method is proposed. Different from AMR, which measures the function regularity based on an empirical gradient operator, and the multi-resolution method with complicated wavelet analysis, the new approach examines the solution smoothness based on the high-order TENO reconstruction (Fu et al. in J Comput Phys 305:333–359, 2016). The core idea is that the TENO scheme not only provides the reconstructed data at the cell interface for flux evaluation but also classifies the local flow scales as smooth or nonsmooth on the discretized mesh. Since the scale-separation procedure is achieved in the spectral and characteristic space, the new adaptation strategy is weakly problem-dependent. Moreover, the extra complexity due to the empirical gradient computing or the wavelet analysis is eliminated. Based on Harten’s finite-volume multi-resolution method (Harten in J Comput Phys 115(2):319–338, 1994), a set of benchmark cases is simulated to validate the performance of the proposed method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn the present paper, we solve the steady state diffusion equation in 3D domains by means of a cell-centered finite volume method that uses a Multipoint Flux Approximation with a Diamond Stencil and a Non-Linear defect correction strategy (MPFA-DNL) to guarantee the Discrete Maximum Principle (DMP). Our formulation is based in the fact that the flux of MPFA methods can be split into two different parts: a Two Point Flux Approximation (TPFA) component and the Cross-Diffusion Terms (CDT). In the linear MPFA-D method, this split is particularly simple since it lies at the core of the original method construction. In this context, we introduce a non-linear defect correction, aiming to mitigate, whenever necessary, the contributions from the CDT, avoiding, this way, spurious oscillations and DMP violations. Our new MPFA-DNL scheme is locally conservative and capable of dealing with arbitrary anisotropic diffusion tensors and unstructured meshes, without harming the second order convergence rates of the original MPFA-D. To appraise the accuracy and robustness of our formulation, we solve some benchmark problems found in literature. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to tetrahedral meshes, even though, in principle, there is no restriction to extend the method to other polyhedral control volumes.",

The effectiveness of this procedure is demonstrated using the discontinuous Galerkin method. This scheme uses a standard WENO reconstruction by dividing the immediate neighbors into subcells to find the degrees of freedom in cells near the overset interface. This also has the added advantage that it also works as a limiter if a discontinuity passes through the overset interface. Accuracy tests to demonstrate the maintenance of higher order are provided.

The SOE method is constructed by a combination of the de la Vallée-Poussin sum for a semi-analytical exponential expansion of a general kernel, and a model reduction technique to minimize the number of exponentials under a given error tolerance. We employ the SOE expansion for the finite part of the splitting convolution kernel so that the convolution integral can be solved as a system of ordinary differential equations. We show that the SOE method works for general kernels with controllable upperbound of positive exponents. Numerical analysis is provided for both the SOE method and the SOE-based convolution quadrature.

Two procedures for constructing high-order grids using either Lagrange or B-spline mappings are outlined. For the linear convection equation, four discretizations are derived and characterized—two based on the mortar-element approach and two based on the global summation-by-parts-operator approach. It is shown numerically that the schemes are dual consistent, and the requirements for achieving functional superconvergence for each set of methods are outlined. For the Euler equations, a dual-consistent mortar-element discretization is proposed and the practical requirements for obtaining accurate solutions and superconvergent functionals for problems of increasing practical relevance are delineated through theory and numerical examples.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe paper first provides an iterated quasi-interpolation scheme for function approximation over periodic domain and then attempts its applications to solve time-dependent surface partial differential equations (PDEs). The key feature of our scheme is that it gives an approximation directly just by taking a weighted average of the available discrete function values evaluated at sampling centers in the periodic domain. As such, it is simple, easy to compute, and the implementation process is stable. Moreover, if the sampling centers distribute uniformly over the periodic domain, it even preserves the same convergence order to all the derivatives. To employ the iterated quasi-interpolation scheme for solving time-dependent surface PDEs, we follow the framework of the method-of-lines. More precisely, we first reformulate the PDEs in terms of the parametric form of the surface. Then we use our quasi-interpolation scheme to approximate both the analytic solution and its spatial derivatives in the reformulated form (of PDEs) to get a semi-discrete ordinary differential equation (ODE) system. Finally, we adopt an appropriate time-integration technique to obtain the full-discrete scheme. As concrete examples, we take the torus for illustration and solve some benchmark reaction-diffusion equations imposed on the torus at the end of the paper. However, the proposed method is general and works on time-dependent PDEs defined on any smooth closed parameterized surfaces without coordinate singularity.",

Adaptive Galerkin methods for time-dependent partial differential equations are studied and shown to be dissipative. The adaptation implies that the subset of the selected basis function changes over time according to the evolution of the solution. The corresponding projection operator is thus time-dependent and nondifferentiable. We therefore propose to use an integral formulation in time. We analyze the existence and uniqueness of this weak form of the dynamical Galerkin scheme, and we then prove that the nonsmooth projection operator introduces energy dissipation, which is a crucial result for adaptive Galerkin methods, e.g., adaptive wavelet methods. Numerical examples for the inviscid Burgers equation in one dimension and the incompressible Euler equations in two and three spatial dimensions show that the selection of basis functions, for instance by filtering out weak wavelet coefficients from the solution, introduces energy dissipation. Moreover, for the Burgers case we can show that adaptive wavelet regularization yields convergence of the truncated Galerkin solution to the physically relevant entropy solution. These results motivate adaptive wavelet-based Galerkin schemes for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws.",

In this paper, an online multiscale model reduction method is presented for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with multiplicative noise, where the diffusion coefficient is spatially multiscale and the noise perturbation nonlinearly depends on the diffusion dynamics. It is necessary to efficiently compute all possible trajectories of the stochastic dynamics for quantifying a model’s uncertainty and statistic moments. The multiscale diffusion and nonlinearity may cause the computation to become very intractable. To overcome the multiscale difficulty, a constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) is used to localize the computation and obtain an effective coarse model. However, the nonlinear terms are still defined on a fine scale space after the Galerkin projection of CEM-GMsFEM is applied to the nonlinear SPDEs. This significantly impacts the simulation efficiency by CEM-GMsFEM. To this end, a stochastic online discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) is proposed to treat the stochastic nonlinearity. The stochastic online DEIM incorporates offline snapshots and online snapshots. The offline snapshots consist of the nonlinear terms at the approximate mean of the stochastic dynamics and are used to construct an offline reduced model. The online snapshots contain some information of the current new trajectory and are used to correct the offline reduced model in an incremental manner. The stochastic online DEIM substantially reduces the dimension of the nonlinear dynamics and enhances the prediction accuracy for the reduced model. Thus, the online multiscale model reduction is constructed by using CEM-GMsFEM and the stochastic online DEIM. A priori error analysis is carried out for the nonlinear SPDEs. We present a few numerical examples with diffusion in heterogeneous porous media and show the effectiveness of the proposed model reduction.",

We establish improved uniform error bounds on time-splitting methods for the long-time dynamics of the Dirac equation with small electromagnetic potentials characterized by a dimensionless parameter [math] representing the amplitude of the potentials. We begin with a semidiscretization of the Dirac equation in time by a time-splitting method, followed by a full-discretization in space by with the Fourier pseudospectral method in space. By employing the unitary flow property of the second-order time-splitting method for the Dirac equation, we prove uniform error bounds for [math] at [math] and [math] for the semidiscretization and full-discretization, respectively, for any time [math] with [math] and [math]. In the expressions, [math] is the time step, [math] is the mesh size, [math] depends on the regularity of the solution, and [math] grows at most linearly with respect to [math] with [math] and [math] two constants independent of [math], [math], [math], and [math]. Then by adopting the regularity compensation oscillation technique, which controls the high frequency modes by the regularity of the solution and low frequency modes by phase cancellation and energy method, we establish improved uniform error bounds at [math] and [math] for the semidiscretization and full-discretization, respectively, up to the long-time [math]. Numerical results are reported to confirm our error bounds and to demonstrate that they are sharp. Comparisons on the accuracy of different time discretizations for the Dirac equation are also provided.",

          "description": "Multiscale Modeling & Simulation, Volume 20, Issue 3, Page 957-1001, September 2022. \n Abstract. A systematic two-step procedure is proposed for the derivation of full asymptotic expansions of the solution of elliptic partial differential equations set on a domain perforated with a small hole on which a Dirichlet boundary condition is applied. First, an integral representation of the solution is sought, which enables us to exploit the explicit dependence with respect to the small parameter to predict the correct form of a two-scale ansatz. Second, the terms of the ansatz are characterized by the method of compound asymptotic expansions as the solutions of a cascade of successive interior and exterior domains. This allows us to interpret them as high-order correctors, for which error bounds can be proved using variational estimates. The methodology is illustrated on two different problems: we start by revisiting the perforated Poisson problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions on both the hole and the outer boundary, where we highlight how the method enables us to retrieve very naturally the correct form of the ansatz in the most delicate two-dimensional setting. Then, we provide original and complete asymptotic expansions for a perforated cell problem featuring periodic conditions.",
