We first consider the application of the proximal ADMM to solve well-posed linearly constrained two-block separable convex minimization problems in Hilbert spaces and obtain new and improved non-ergodic convergence rate results, including linear and sublinear rates under certain regularity conditions. We next consider the proximal ADMM as a regularization method for solving linear ill-posed inverse problems in Hilbert spaces.

By providing a linear error analysis and utilizing a Strang splitting-type approach, we construct them on the basis of orthogonal Runge–Kutta–Chebyshev methods of order 2. Our methods are of weak order 2 and have high computational accuracy for relatively large time-step size, as well as good stability properties. In addition, we take stochastic exponential RK methods of weak order 2 as competitors, and deal with implementation issues on Krylov subspace projection techniques for them. We carry out numerical experiments on a variety of linear and nonlinear problems to check the computational performance of the methods. As a result, it is shown that the proposed methods can be very effective on high-dimensional problems whose drift term has eigenvalues lying near the negative real axis and whose diffusion term does not have very large noise.",

First, by applying a finite volume method with upwind numerical fluxes to the degenerate Cahn–Hilliard equation rewritten by the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach, we creatively obtain an unconditionally bound-preserving, energy-stable and fully-discrete scheme, which, for the first time, addresses the boundedness of the classical SAV approach under \n                      \n                      \\(H^{-1}\\)\n                      \n                    -gradient flow. Then, a dimensional-splitting technique is introduced in high-dimensional cases, which greatly reduces the computational complexity while preserves original structural properties. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the bound-preserving and energy-stable properties of the proposed scheme. Finally, by applying the proposed structure-preserving scheme, we numerically demonstrate that surface diffusion is approximated by the Cahn–Hilliard equation with degenerate mobility and Flory–Huggins potential, when the absolute temperature is sufficiently low, which agrees well with the theoretical result by using formal asymptotic analysis.",

A Bayesian inference scheme, combining a multi-fidelity strategy and surrogate model with guided modes and a deep neural network is proposed to reconstruct the shapes of unknown scattering objects. First, the inverse problem is reformulated as a statistical inference problem using Bayes’ formula, which provides statistical characteristics of the posterior distribution and quantification of the uncertainties. The well-posedness of the posterior distribution is proved by using the f-divergence. Subsequently, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is used to explore the posterior density.

Theoretically, we analyze the properties of the function and the minimizers of its associated proximal problem. Since the proximal problem has no closed-form solution, we propose a derivative-free Nelder-Mead simplex based selection algorithm to find the global minimizer. To reduce the computational cost, we only solve a small 1D problem and then use the 1D solution template as a look-up table to interpolate high-dimension data. Moreover, we consider a variational model based on the proposed image prior. Then we use the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm on the nonconvex model to derive efficient numerical algorithms. Various experiments on image denoising, image deblurring, and image reconstruction demonstrate that the proposed nonconvex prior is competitive with the existing priors. In particular, it outperforms others in recovering piecewise constant images.",

Chemical reactions can be modeled by a random time-changed Poisson process on countable states. The macroscopic behaviors, such as large fluctuations, can be studied via the WKB reformulation. The WKB reformulation for the backward equation is Varadhan’s discrete nonlinear semigroup and is also a monotone scheme that approximates the limiting first-order Hamilton–Jacobi equations (HJE). The discrete Hamiltonian is an m-accretive operator, which generates a nonlinear semigroup on countable grids and justifies the well-posedness of the chemical master equation and the backward equation with “no reaction” boundary conditions. The convergence from the monotone schemes to the viscosity solution of HJE is proved by constructing barriers to overcome the polynomial growth coefficients in the Hamiltonian. This implies the convergence of Varadhan’s discrete nonlinear semigroup to the continuous Lax–Oleinik semigroup and leads to the large deviation principle for the chemical reaction process at any single time. Consequently, the macroscopic mean-field limit reaction rate equation is recovered with a concentration rate estimate. Furthermore, we establish the convergence from a reversible invariant measure to an upper semicontinuous viscosity solution of the stationary HJE.",

We study a Stokes system posed in a thin perforated layer with a Navier-slip condition on the internal oscillating boundary from two viewpoints: (1) dimensional reduction of the layer and (2) homogenization of the perforated structure. Assuming the perforations are periodic, both aspects can be described through a small parameter [math], which is related to the thickness of the layer as well as the size of the periodic structure. By letting [math] tend to zero, we prove that the sequence of solutions converges to a limit which satisfies a well-defined macroscopic problem. More precisely, the limit velocity and limit pressure satisfy a two pressure Stokes model, from which a Darcy law for thin layers can be derived. Due to nonstandard boundary conditions, some additional terms appear in Darcy’s law.",

Coarse-scale surrogate models in the context of numerical homogenization of linear elliptic problems with arbitrary rough diffusion coefficients rely on the efficient solution of fine-scale subproblems on local subdomains whose solutions are then employed to deduce appropriate coarse contributions to the surrogate model. However, in the absence of periodicity and scale separation, the reliability of such models requires the local subdomains to cover the whole domain which may result in high offline costs, in particular for parameter-dependent and stochastic problems. This paper justifies the use of neural networks for the approximation of coarse-scale surrogate models by analyzing their approximation properties. For a prototypical and representative numerical homogenization technique, the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition method, we show that one single neural network is sufficient to approximate the coarse contributions of all occurring coefficient-dependent local subproblems for a nontrivial class of diffusion coefficients up to arbitrary accuracy. We present rigorous upper bounds on the depth and number of nonzero parameters for such a network to achieve a given accuracy. Further, we analyze the overall error of the resulting neural network enhanced numerical homogenization surrogate model.",

We study the quantitative homogenization of linear second order elliptic equations in nondivergence form with highly oscillating periodic diffusion coefficients and with large drifts, in the so-called centered setting where homogenization occurs and the large drifts contribute to the effective diffusivity. Using the centering condition and the invariant measures associated with the underlying diffusion process, we transform the equation into divergence form with modified diffusion coefficients but without drift. The latter is in the standard setting for which quantitative homogenization results have been developed systematically. An application of those results then yields quantitative estimates, such as the convergence rates and uniform Lipschitz regularity, for equations in nondivergence form with large drifts.",

We propose a framework to study tipping points in reaction-diffusion equations (RDEs) in one spatial dimension, where the reaction term decays in space (asymptotically homogeneous) and varies linearly with time (nonautonomous) due to an external input. A compactification of the moving-frame coordinate together with Lin’s method to construct heteroclinic orbits along intersections of stable and unstable invariant manifolds allows us to (i) obtain multiple coexisting pulse and front solutions for the RDE by computing heteroclinic orbits connecting equilibria at negative and positive infinity in the compactified moving-frame ordinary differential equation, (ii) detect tipping points as dangerous bifurcations of such heteroclinic orbits, and (iii) obtain tipping diagrams by numerical continuation of such bifurcations. We apply our framework to an illustrative model of a habitat patch that features an Allee effect in population growth and is geographically shrinking or shifting due to human activity or climate change. Thus, we identify two classes of tipping points to extinction: bifurcation-induced tipping (B-tipping) when the shrinking habitat falls below some critical length and rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) when the shifting habitat exceeds some critical speed. We explore two-parameter R-tipping diagrams to understand how the critical speed depends on the size of the habitat patch and the dispersal rate of the population, uncover parameter regions where the shifting population survives, and relate these regions to the invasion speed in an infinite homogeneous habitat. Furthermore, we contrast the tipping instabilities with gradual transitions to extinction found for logistic population growth without the Allee effect.",

We propose a non-local model for contact guidance and steric hindrance depending on a single external cue, namely the extracellular matrix, that affects in a twofold way the polarization and speed of motion of the cells. We start from a microscopic description of the stochastic processes underlying the cell re-orientation mechanism related to the change of cell speed and direction. Then, we formally derive the corresponding kinetic model that implements exactly the prescribed microscopic dynamics, and, from it, it is possible to deduce the macroscopic limit in the appropriate regime. Moreover, we test our model in several scenarios. In particular, we numerically investigate the minimal microscopic mechanisms that are necessary to reproduce cell dynamics by comparing the outcomes of our model with some experimental results related to breast cancer cell migration. This allows us to validate the proposed modeling approach and to highlight its capability of predicting qualitative cell behaviors in diverse heterogeneous microenvironments.",

A homogenized model is developed to describe the interaction between aligned strings and an incompressible, viscous, Newtonian fluid. In the case of many strings, the ratio of string separation to domain width gives a small parameter which can be exploited to simplify the problem. Model derivation using multiscale asymptotics results in a modified Darcy law for fluid flow, with coefficients determined by averaged solutions to microscale problems. Fluid flow is coupled to solid deformation via a homogenized force balance obtained by coarse-graining the balance on each string. This approach offers an alternative method to systematically derive the equations governing the interaction of Stokes flow with many flexible structures. The resulting model of fluid-structure interaction is reduced to a single scalar, linear, partial differential equation by introducing a potential for the pressure. Analytical solutions are presented for a cylindrical geometry subject to time-harmonic motion of the string ends. Scaling laws are identified that describe the variation of shear stress exerted on the string surface with the forcing frequency.",

We show that the switching rate provides a powerful mechanism for controlling the densities of spontaneously emerging aggregates. Specifically, in two- and three-dimensional settings it is shown that when both switching rates coincide and are suitably large, the densities of both the chemotaxing and the secreting populations will exceed any prescribed level at some points in the considered domain.

We consider the problem of designing fundamental graph algorithms on the model of massively parallel computation (MPC). The input to the problem is an undirected graph [math] with [math] vertices and [math] edges and with [math] being the maximum diameter of any connected component in [math]. We consider the MPC with low local space, allowing each machine to store only [math] words for an arbitrary constant [math] and with linear global space (which is the number of machines times the local space available), that is, with optimal utilization. In a recent breakthrough, Andoni et al. [Parallel graph connectivity in log diameter rounds, 2018] and Behnezhad, Hajiaghayi, and Harris [Exponentially faster massively parallel maximal matching, 2019] designed parallel randomized algorithms that in [math] rounds on an MPC with low local space determine all connected components of a graph, improving on the classic bound of [math] derived from earlier works on PRAM algorithms. In this paper, we show that asymptotically identical bounds can be also achieved for deterministic algorithms: We present a deterministic MPC low local space algorithm that in [math] rounds determines connected components of the input graph. Our result matches the complexity of state-of-the-art randomized algorithms for this task. We complement our upper bounds by extending a recent lower bound for the connectivity on an MPC conditioned on the 1-vs-2-cycles conjecture (which requires [math]) by showing a related conditional hardness of [math] MPC rounds for the entire spectrum of [math], covering a particularly interesting range when [math].",

We prove an optimal mixing time bound for the single-site update Markov chain known as the Glauber dynamics or Gibbs sampling in a variety of settings. Our work presents an improved version of the spectral independence approach of Anari, Liu, and Oveis Gharan [Proceedings of the 61st Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2020, pp. 1319–1330] and shows [math] mixing time on any [math]-vertex graph of bounded degree when the maximum eigenvalue of an associated influence matrix is bounded. As an application of our results, for the hardcore model on independent sets weighted by a fugacity [math], we establish [math] mixing time for the Glauber dynamics on any [math]-vertex graph of constant maximum degree [math] …",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. We exhibit an unambiguous [math]-DNF (disjunctive normal form) formula that requires conjunctive normal form width [math], which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. As a consequence, we get a near-optimal solution to the Alon–Saks–Seymour problem in graph theory (posed in 1991), which asks, How large a gap can there be between the chromatic number of a graph and its biclique partition number? Our result is also known to imply several other improved separations in query/communication complexity, learning theory, and automata theory.",
