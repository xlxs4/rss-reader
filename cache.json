          "description": "Abstract\nIn this article, a Fast Linear Elastic Eigenvalue Problem Solver (FLEEPS) is developed to calculate the band structures of three-dimensional (3D) isotropic phononic crystals (PnCs). In brief, FLEEPS solves in linear time complexity the smallest few eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of the linear elastic eigenvalue problem originating from the finite difference discretization of the frequency-domain linear elastic wave equation. Notably, FLEEPS employs the weighted singular value decomposition based preconditioner to greatly improve the convergence rate of the conjugate gradient iteration, and uses the fast Fourier transform algorithm to accelerate this preconditioner times a vector, based on the structured decomposition of the dense unitary factor T of this preconditioner. Band structure calculations of several 3D isotropic PnCs are presented to showcase the capabilities of FLEEPS. The preliminary MATLAB implementation of FLEEPS is available at https://github.com/FAME-GPU/FLEEPS-MATLAB.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose a reduced-order modeling strategy for two-way Dirichlet–Neumann parametric coupled problems solved with domain-decomposition (DD) sub-structuring methods. We split the original coupled differential problem into two sub-problems with Dirichlet and Neumann interface conditions, respectively. After discretization by, e.g., the finite element method, the full-order model (FOM) is solved by Dirichlet–Neumann iterations between the two sub-problems until interface convergence is reached. We then apply the reduced basis (RB) method to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the solution of each sub-problem. Furthermore, we apply the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) at the interface level to achieve a fully reduced-order representation of the DD techniques implemented. To deal with non-conforming FE interface discretizations, we employ the INTERNODES method combined with the interface DEIM reduction. The reduced-order model (ROM) is then solved by sub-iterating between the two reduced-order sub-problems until the convergence of the approximated high-fidelity interface solutions. The ROM scheme is numerically verified on both steady and unsteady coupled problems, in the case of non-conforming FE interfaces.",

          "description": "Abstract\nAn auxiliary optimal control problem is formulated that provides with its unique solution, a continuous representation of the global error of a numerical approximation to the solution of a linear quadratic optimal control problem. The resulting error functions are characterized as the unique solutions to an optimality system that is reformulated as a boundary value problem. With this formulation, reliable pointwise error estimates can be generated utilizing well-established techniques of defect control. A novel algorithm based on defect correction and defect control is presented that generates pointwise approximations to the global error of numerical optimal control solutions on a uniform grid. It is proven and numerically validated that this algorithm can generate pointwise estimates that approximate the true global error with a prescribed accuracy.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, by introducing a reconstruction operator based on the Legendre moments, we construct a reduced discontinuous Galerkin (RDG) space that could achieve the same approximation accuracy but using fewer degrees of freedom (DoFs) than the standard discontinuous Galerkin (DG) space. The design of the “narrow-stencil-based” reconstruction operator can preserve the local data structure property of the high-order DG methods. With the RDG space, we apply the local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method with the implicit-explicit time marching for the nonlinear unsteady convection–diffusion–reaction equation, where the reduction of the number of DoFs allows us to achieve higher efficiency. In terms of theoretical analysis, we give the well-posedness and approximation properties for the reconstruction operator and the \n                      \n                      \\(L^2\\)\n                      \n                     error estimate for the semi-discrete LDG scheme.

Namely, it uses the inverse of the regularization quasi-Newton matrix as the pre-conditioner and the Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula to improve its computational efficiency in the well-posed phase, and it adopts the inverse of the regularization two-sided projection of the Hessian as the pre-conditioner to improve its robustness in the ill-conditioned phase. Since it only solves a linear system of equations and the Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula significantly saves the computational time at every iteration, and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method needs to solve a quadratic programming subproblem at every iteration, it is faster than SQP. Numerical results also show that it is more robust and faster than SQP (the built-in subroutine fmincon.m of the MATLAB2020a environment and the subroutine SNOPT executed in GAMS v28.2 (GAMS Corporation, 2019) environment). The computational time of the new method is about one third of that of fmincon.m for the large-scale problem. Finally, the global convergence analysis of the new method is also given.",

The resulting method is fully discrete and has a compact stencil in space and time. An important component of Active Flux methods is the evolution formula for the update of the point values. A previously proposed exact evolution formula for acoustics is reviewed and used to construct an Active Flux method for the two-dimensional Maxwell’s equation. Furthermore, the method of bicharacteristics is discussed as a methodology for the derivation of truly multidimensional approximative evolution operators that can be used for the evolution of point values in Active Flux methods. We study accuracy and stability of the resulting methods for acoustics and compare with the Active Flux method that uses the exact evolution operator. Finally, we used the method of bicharacteristics to derive Cartesian grid Active Flux methods for the linearised and nonlinear Euler equations. Numerous test computations illustrate the performance of these new Active Flux methods.",

We are interested in the resonant electromagnetic scattering by all-dielectric metasurfaces made of a two-dimensional lattice of nanoparticles with high refractive indices. In [Ammari, Li, and Zou, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 376 (2023), pp. 39–90], it has been shown that a single high-index nanoresonator can couple with the incident wave and exhibit a strong magnetic dipole response. Recent physics experiments reveal that when the particles are arranged in certain periodic configurations, they may have different anomalous scattering effects in the macroscopic scale, compared to the single-particle case. In this work, we shall develop a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the resonant behaviors of all-dielectric metasurfaces. We start with the characterization of subwavelength scattering resonances in such a periodic setting and their asymptotic expansions in terms of the refractive index of the nanoparticles. Then we show that real resonances always exist below the essential spectrum of the periodic Maxwell operator and that they are the simple poles of the scattering resolvent with the exponentially decaying resonant modes. By using group theory, we discuss the implications of the symmetry of the metasurface on the subwavelength band functions and their associated eigenfunctions. For the symmetric metasurfaces with the normal incidence, we use a variational method to show the existence of embedded eigenvalues (i.e., real subwavelength resonances embedded in the continuous radiation spectrum). Furthermore, we break the configuration symmetry either by introducing a small deformation of particles or by slightly deviating from the normal incidence and prove that Fano-type reflection and transmission anomalies can arise in both of these scenarios.",

Coarse-graining or model reduction is a term describing a range of approaches used to extend the timescale of molecular simulations by reducing the number of degrees of freedom. In the context of molecular simulation, standard coarse-graining approaches approximate the potential of mean force and use this to drive an effective Markovian model. To gain insight into this process, the simple case of a quadratic energy is studied in an overdamped setting. A hierarchy of reduced models is derived and analyzed, and the merits of these different coarse-graining approaches are discussed. In particular, while standard recipes for model reduction accurately capture static equilibrium statistics, it is shown that dynamical statistics, such as the mean-squared displacement, display systematic error, even when a system exhibits large timescale separation. In the linear setting studied, it is demonstrated both analytically and numerically that such models can be augmented in a simple way to better capture dynamical statistics.",

The Kuramoto model is a classical mathematical model in the field of nonlinear dynamical systems that describes the evolution of coupled oscillators in a network that may reach a synchronous state. The relationship between the network’s topology and whether the oscillators synchronize is a central question in the field of synchronization, and random graphs are often employed as a proxy for complex networks. On the other hand, the random graphs on which the Kuramoto model is rigorously analyzed in the literature are homogeneous models and fail to capture the underlying geometric structure that appears in several examples. In this work, we leverage tools from random matrix theory, random graphs, and mathematical statistics to prove that the Kuramoto model on a random geometric graph on the sphere synchronizes with probability tending to one as the number of nodes tends to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous result for the Kuramoto model on random geometric graphs.",

This paper studies the soliton dynamics for the Rabi-coupled Gross–Pitaevskii model in multicomponent Bose–Einstein condensates. The model has variable nonlinearities and external potentials and is used to construct a complex multisoliton in an explicit form. The variable nonlinearity and external potential cause the soliton to compress and change its velocity, respectively. A new generalized similarity transformation is proposed to eliminate the [math] Rabi-coupled terms in the [math]-component model, which can make the Hirota bilinear method be applied to obtain multisoliton solutions. The bound state of the two-soliton forms the soliton molecule under velocity resonance. Asymptotic analysis can give the asymptotic expressions of each single soliton in multisoliton solutions, which can clearly give each soliton’s width, velocity, amplitude, and energy; these parameters can control multisolitons. When the solitons’ relative velocity or the solitons’ width is large, the interferogram between solitons will be observed. Numerical simulation shows that these solitons can steadily propagate. It is easy for the soliton molecule and interference dynamics to occur because of the controlled soliton. Since the coupled Gross–Pitaevskii equation describes the mechanics of matter waves in Bose–Einstein condensates, it is proved that we can observe the stable solitons and soliton molecules in Bose–Einstein condensates. The method and results presented in this paper are also common to other similar models. When observing particle multiple distributions, quantum interferometry, and interferometers, the results presented and the model in this paper can provide a reference for these applications.",

This work contributes to these tasks with the formulation and analysis of an optimal control problem for the Wigner equation, which describes the time evolution of the quasi-density function. For this purpose, two possible control mechanisms are considered, and, correspondingly, a detailed analysis in weighted Sobolev spaces for the controlled nonhomogeneous Wigner equation is presented. Further theoretical results are reported concerning existence of optimal controls and differentiability of the control-to-state map and of the ensemble cost functional, which allows the derivation of the optimality system that characterizes the optimal controls sought.",

A lubrication model can be used to describe the dynamics of a weakly volatile viscous fluid layer on a hydrophobic substrate. Thin layers of the fluid are unstable to perturbations and break up into slowly evolving interacting droplets. A reduced-order dynamical system is derived from the lubrication model based on the nearest-neighbor droplet interactions in the weak condensation limit. Dynamics for periodic arrays of identical drops and pairwise droplet interactions are investigated, providing insights into the coarsening dynamics of a large droplet system. Weak condensation is shown to be a singular perturbation, fundamentally changing the long-time coarsening dynamics for the droplets and the overall mass of the fluid in two additional regimes of long-time dynamics.",

In this paper, a study is carried out on the spatiotemporal dynamics of a Lengyel–Epstein model describing the chlorite-iodine-malonic-acid (CIMA) reaction with time delay and the Neumann boundary condition in a two-dimensional region. The existences for Turing, Hopf, Turing–Turing, Turing–Hopf, and Bogdanov–Takens bifurcations are derived by analyzing the dispersion relation between eigenvalues and wave numbers. In particular, to study the dynamics around a Turing–Hopf bifurcation singularity, the amplitude equations near a codimension-two bifurcation point are derived by employing the weakly nonlinear analysis method. Different spatiotemporal patterns for the system in parameter space are classified and various patterns identified, including spatially homogeneous periodic solutions, mixed mode, coexistence mode, bistable phenomenon, square, hexagon, black eye, two-phase oscillating staggered hexagon lattice, and other complex spatiotemporal patterns. The theoretical predictions are verified by numerical simulations showing an excellent agreement with many reported experiment results not only in chemistry but also in physics and biology. Results presented in this article reveal the mechanism of generating the spatiotemporal patterns of the CIMA reaction.",

A method for computing the Riesz [math]-capacity, [math], of a general set [math] is given. The method is based on simulations of isotropic [math]-stable motion paths in [math]-dimensions. The familiar walk-on-spheres method, often utilized for simulating Brownian motion, is modified to a novel walk-in-and-out-of-balls method adapted for modeling the stable path process on the exterior of regions “probed” by this type of generalized random walk. It accounts for the propensity of this class of random walk to jump through boundaries because of the path discontinuity. This method allows for the computationally efficient simulation of hitting locations of stable paths launched from the exterior of probed sets. Reliable methods of computing capacity from these locations are given, along with non-standard confidence intervals. Illustrative calculations are performed for representative types of sets [math], where both [math] and [math] are varied.",

In this paper we give a polynomial time-algorithm that starts with a 4-precoloring of a graph with no induced six-vertex path and outputs a polynomial-sized collection of so-called excellent precolorings. Excellent precolorings are easier to handle than general ones, and, in addition, in order to determine whether the initial precoloring can be extended to the whole graph, it is enough to answer the same question for each of the excellent precolorings in the collection. The first paper in the series deals with excellent precolorings, thus providing a complete solution to the problem.",
