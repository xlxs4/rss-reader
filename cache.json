          "description": "Abstract\nAn asymptotic preserving and energy stable scheme for the barotropic Euler system under the low Mach number scaling is designed and analysed. A velocity shift proportional to the pressure gradient is introduced in the convective fluxes, which leads to the dissipation of mechanical energy and the entropy stability at all Mach numbers. The resolution of the semi-implicit in time and upwind finite volume in space fully-discrete scheme involves two steps: the solution of an elliptic problem for the density and an explicit evaluation for the velocity. The proposed scheme possesses several physically relevant attributes, such as the positivity of density, the entropy stability and the consistency with the weak formulation of the continuous Euler system. The AP property of the scheme, i.e. the boundedness of the mesh parameters with respect to the Mach number and its consistency with the incompressible limit system, is shown rigorously. The results of extensive case studies are presented to substantiate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we reformulate the coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (CNLS) equation by using the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach and solve the resulting system by using Crank-Nicolson finite element method. The fully-discrete method is proved to be mass- and energy-conserved. However, if the convergence results are investigated by using the classical way, the presence of \n                      \n                      \\(u_t\\)\n                      \n                     and \n                      \n                      \\(v_t\\)\n                      \n                     in the equation of \n                      \n                      \\(r'(t)\\)\n                      \n                     may lead to not only a consistency error of sub-optimal order in time but also some difficulties in analysing the numerical stability. The mentioned difficulties are overcome technically by estimating the difference quotient of the error in the \n                      \n                      \\(H^{-1}\\)\n                      \n                    -norm and carefully analysising the connections of errors between the couple systems.

These equations couple the flow of relativistic fluids via electromagnetic quantities evolved using Maxwell’s equations. The proposed schemes are based on the Gauss–Lobatto quadrature rule, which has the summation by parts property. We exploit the structure of the equations having the flux with three independent parts coupled via nonlinear source terms. We design entropy stable DG schemes for each flux part, coupled with the fact that the source terms do not affect entropy, resulting in an entropy stable scheme for the complete system. The proposed schemes are then tested on various test problems in one and two dimensions to demonstrate their accuracy and stability.",

We suggest enhanced basis functions, defined on the reference triangle and tetrahedron, aiming to reduce the condition number of the resulting global matrix. Moreover, element-level static condensation of the interior degrees of freedom is performed in order to reduce memory requirements. The performance of BBFEM is assessed using several benchmark tests. A preliminary analysis is first conducted to highlight the advantage of the suggested basis functions in improving the conditioning. Numerical results dealing with the electromagnetic scattering from a perfect electric conductor demonstrate the effectiveness of BBFEM in mitigating the pollution effect and its efficiency in capturing high-order evanescent wave modes. Electromagnetic wave scattering by a circular dielectric, with high wave speed contrast, is also investigated. The interior curved interface between layers is accurately described based on a linear blending map to avoid numerical errors due to geometry description. The achieved results support our expectations for highly accurate and efficient BBFEM for time harmonic wave problems.",

The focus of the paper is the construction of two new numerical fluxes at junctions, which are based on the Godunov numerical flux. We analyze the basic properties of the two Godunov-based fluxes and the resulting scheme, namely conservativity and the traffic distribution property. We prove that if the junction is not congested, the traffic flows according to predetermined preferences of the drivers. Otherwise a small traffic distribution error is present, which we interpret as either the existence of dedicated turning lanes, or factoring of human behavior into the model. We compare our approach to that of Čanić et al. (J Sci Comput 63:233–255, 2015). Numerical experiments are provided.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this work, we propose adaptive deep learning approaches based on normalizing flows for solving fractional Fokker–Planck equations (FPEs). The solution of a FPE is a probability density function (PDF). Traditional mesh-based methods are ineffective because of a unbounded computation domain, a large number of dimensions and a nonlocal fractional operator. To this end, we represent the solution with an explicit PDF model induced by a flow-based deep generative model, which constructs a transport map from a simple distribution to the target distribution. We consider two methods to approximate the fractional Laplacian. One method is the Monte Carlo approximation. The other method is to construct an auxiliary model with Gaussian radial basis functions (GRBFs) to approximate the solution such that we may take advantage of the fact that the fractional Laplacian of a Gaussian is known analytically. Based on these two different ways for the approximation of the fractional Laplacian, we propose two models to approximate stationary FPEs and one model to approximate time-dependent FPEs. To further improve the accuracy, we refine the training set and the approximate solution alternately. A variety of numerical examples is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptive deep density approaches.",

To handle the non-smooth multi-phase labeling model, we introduce a quadratic proximal term, resulting in a strongly convex model. This paper provides theoretical evidence supporting the convergence of the proposed non-overlapping DDMs. Specifically, it is demonstrated that the non-overlapping DDMs for the non-smooth labeling model exhibits an O(1/n) convergence rate of the energy functional, where n is the number of iterations. Moreover, the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (Beck and Teboulle in SIAM J Imaging Sci 2(1):183–202, 2009) is applied to achieve an \n                      \n                      \\(O(1/n^2)\\)\n                      \n                     convergence rate.

We present a fast direct solver for boundary integral equations on complex surfaces in three dimensions using an extension of the recently introduced recursive strong skeletonization scheme. For problems that are not highly oscillatory, our algorithm computes an [math]-like hierarchical factorization of the dense system matrix, permitting application of the inverse in [math] time, where [math] is the number of unknowns on the surface. The factorization itself also scales linearly with the system size, albeit with a somewhat larger constant. The scheme is built on a level-restricted adaptive octree data structure, and therefore, it is compatible with highly nonuniform discretizations. Furthermore, the scheme is coupled with high-order accurate locally-corrected Nyström quadrature methods to integrate the singular and weakly-singular Green’s functions used in the integral representations. Our method has immediate applications to a variety of problems in computational physics. We concentrate here on studying its performance in acoustic scattering (governed by the Helmholtz equation) at low to moderate frequencies, and provide rigorous justification for compression of submatrices via proxy surfaces.",

Developing a model to capture all aspects of a complex dynamical system is an immense task, and each model will have deficiencies in some areas, such as global climate models having difficulty in capturing tropical intraseasonal variability such as the Madden–Julian oscillation. Besides complex models, it is possible to create simplified, low-dimensional models to capture specific phenomena while ignoring many aspects of the full system. Here, we propose a strategy to allow complex models to communicate with simplified models throughout a simulation. The communication allows one to leverage the strengths of each model, without needing to change their dynamics, to mitigate model error. Furthermore, to ensure ease of implementation in complex systems, the strategy is based on common data assimilation techniques that are normally used to combine models and real-world data. This strategy is investigated here in a test case that is nonlinear, non-Gaussian, and high-dimensional (approximately [math] degrees of freedom), and the multiple models have different state spaces. In particular, it is an idealized tropical climate model in three spatial dimensions. The multimodel communication strategy is seen to mitigate model error and reproduce statistical features akin to those of the truth model when the communication is sufficiently frequent. In these tests, the low-dimensional model contributes only two degrees of freedom, which suggests that, in some systems, large amounts of model error can possibly be reduced by focusing on a small set of model components.",

We propose a framework to study tipping points in reaction-diffusion equations (RDEs) in one spatial dimension, where the reaction term decays in space (asymptotically homogeneous) and varies linearly with time (nonautonomous) due to an external input. A compactification of the moving-frame coordinate together with Lin’s method to construct heteroclinic orbits along intersections of stable and unstable invariant manifolds allows us to (i) obtain multiple coexisting pulse and front solutions for the RDE by computing heteroclinic orbits connecting equilibria at negative and positive infinity in the compactified moving-frame ordinary differential equation, (ii) detect tipping points as dangerous bifurcations of such heteroclinic orbits, and (iii) obtain tipping diagrams by numerical continuation of such bifurcations. We apply our framework to an illustrative model of a habitat patch that features an Allee effect in population growth and is geographically shrinking or shifting due to human activity or climate change. Thus, we identify two classes of tipping points to extinction: bifurcation-induced tipping (B-tipping) when the shrinking habitat falls below some critical length and rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) when the shifting habitat exceeds some critical speed. We explore two-parameter R-tipping diagrams to understand how the critical speed depends on the size of the habitat patch and the dispersal rate of the population, uncover parameter regions where the shifting population survives, and relate these regions to the invasion speed in an infinite homogeneous habitat. Furthermore, we contrast the tipping instabilities with gradual transitions to extinction found for logistic population growth without the Allee effect.",

We begin our study by considering stream networks consisting of three nodes and prove that the strategy to maximize the total biomass is to concentrate all the resources in the most upstream locations.

Laws of large numbers guarantee that given a large enough sample from some population, the measure of any fixed subpopulation is well-estimated by its frequency in the sample. We study laws of large numbers in sampling processes that can affect the environment they are acting upon and interact with it. Specifically, we consider the sequential sampling model proposed by [O. Ben-Eliezer and E. Yogev, The adversarial robustness of sampling, in Proceedings of the 39th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS), 2020, pp. 49–62] and characterize the classes which admit a uniform law of large numbers in this model: these are exactly the classes that are online learnable. Our characterization may be interpreted as an online analogue to the equivalence between learnability and uniform convergence in statistical (PAC) learning. The sample-complexity bounds we obtain are tight for many parameter regimes, and as an application, we determine the optimal regret bounds in online learning, stated in terms of Littlestone’s dimension, thus resolving the main open question from [S.

We consider the problem of designing fundamental graph algorithms on the model of massively parallel computation (MPC). The input to the problem is an undirected graph [math] with [math] vertices and [math] edges and with [math] being the maximum diameter of any connected component in [math]. We consider the MPC with low local space, allowing each machine to store only [math] words for an arbitrary constant [math] and with linear global space (which is the number of machines times the local space available), that is, with optimal utilization. In a recent breakthrough, Andoni et al. [Parallel graph connectivity in log diameter rounds, 2018] and Behnezhad, Hajiaghayi, and Harris [Exponentially faster massively parallel maximal matching, 2019] designed parallel randomized algorithms that in [math] rounds on an MPC with low local space determine all connected components of a graph, improving on the classic bound of [math] derived from earlier works on PRAM algorithms. In this paper, we show that asymptotically identical bounds can be also achieved for deterministic algorithms: We present a deterministic MPC low local space algorithm that in [math] rounds determines connected components of the input graph. Our result matches the complexity of state-of-the-art randomized algorithms for this task. We complement our upper bounds by extending a recent lower bound for the connectivity on an MPC conditioned on the 1-vs-2-cycles conjecture (which requires [math]) by showing a related conditional hardness of [math] MPC rounds for the entire spectrum of [math], covering a particularly interesting range when [math].",
