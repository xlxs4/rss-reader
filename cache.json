          "description": "Abstract\nProjected gradient descent and its Riemannian variant belong to a typical class of methods for low-rank matrix estimation. This paper proposes a new Nesterov’s Accelerated Riemannian Gradient algorithm using efficient orthographic retraction and tangent space projection. The subspace relationship between iterative and extrapolated sequences on the low-rank matrix manifold provides computational convenience. With perturbation analysis of truncated singular value decomposition and two retractions, we systematically analyze the local convergence of gradient algorithms and Nesterov’s variants in the Euclidean and Riemannian settings. Theoretically, we estimate the exact rate of local linear convergence under different parameters using the spectral radius in a closed form and give the optimal convergence rate and the corresponding momentum parameter. When the parameter is unknown, the adaptive restart scheme can avoid the oscillation problem caused by high momentum, thus approaching the optimal convergence rate. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the estimations of convergence rate and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive with first-order methods for matrix completion and matrix sensing.",

          "description": "Abstract\nA stabilized element-free Galerkin (EFG) method is developed and analyzed in this paper for the meshless numerical solution of Stokes problems. To accelerate the solution procedure and recover the optimal convergence impaired by Gauss integration, integration constraints of Galerkin numerical methods for Stokes problems are derived, and then the inherently consistent reproducing kernel gradient smoothing integration is incorporated into the EFG method with explicit quadrature rules in the reference space. By using Nitsche’s method to satisfy the Dirichlet boundary condition, the inf-sup stability, the existence and uniqueness, and the error estimation of the EFG solution with numerical integration are derived rigorously. Theoretical results reveal that the EFG error essentially comes from not only the meshless approximations of velocity and pressure, but also numerical integration of the Galerkin weak forms. It turns out a procedure on how to choose quadrature rules to ensure that the optimal convergence is not affected by the integration error. Numerical results demonstrate the consistency, efficiency and optimal convergence of the method, and support the theoretical results.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this study, we propose a unified, general framework for the direct discontinuous Galerkin methods. In the new framework, the antiderivative of the nonlinear diffusion matrix is not needed. This allows a simple definition of the numerical flux, which can be used for general diffusion equations with no further modification. We also present the nonlinear stability analyses of the new direct discontinuous Galerkin methods and perform several numerical experiments to evaluate their performance. The numerical tests show that the symmetric and the interface correction versions of the method achieve optimal convergence and are superior to the nonsymmetric version, which demonstrates optimal convergence only for problems with diagonal diffusion matrices but loses order for even degree polynomials with a non-diagonal diffusion matrix. Singular or blow up solutions are also well captured with the new direct discontinuous Galerkin methods.",

By introducing an auxiliary function, we rewrite the original problem as an equivalent fourth-order coupled form in spherical coordinates. Using the properties of spherical harmonic and Laplace–Beltrami operator, we further decompose the original problem into a series of decoupled one-dimensional fourth-order linear eigenvalue problems, for which a new mixed variational formulation and its discretization is developed. For error estimates of numerical eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, we recall the spectral theory of compact operators. Towards this end, we derive the essential polar conditions, define a class of weighted Sobolev spaces, and most importantly, prove a sequence of two compact embedding properties for the weighted Sobolev spaces, based on which the spectral theory of compact operators for the variational formulation and discrete system can be established. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to confirm the theoretical error analysis and the efficiency of our algorithm.",

The fully discrete schemes are defined with local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) spatial discretization methods coupled with implicit–explicit (IMEX) temporal discretization methods based on backward difference formulas (BDF). By combining an improved multiplier technique used in the stability analysis for multistep methods and the technique to deal with derivative and jump in LDG methods, we establish a general framework of stability analysis for the corresponding fully discrete LDG–IMEX–BDF schemes up to fifth order in time.

The extrapolation coefficients can be chosen to satisfy \n                      \n                      \\(\\sup _k \\beta _k=1\\)\n                      \n                    .

Here we investigate replacing a costly L1 minimization step in the original RBF-TD method with an ensemble ML model known as an extremely randomized trees regressor (ERT). We show that an ERT model trained on a simple PDE can maintain the high order accuracy of the original method with often significant speed up, while generalizing to a variety of convection-dominated PDEs. Through this work, we also extend the RBF-TD method to problems in 2-D space plus time.

The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed solver is illustrated by numerical experiments with dimension d up to 20 for case of low TT-ranks initial conditions and source terms.",

We introduce a multistep scheme for reconstructing multiscale sources from multifrequency sparse electric far field patterns. The unknown source is a combination of electric dipoles, magnetic dipoles and extended sources. The dipoles are shown to be uniquely identified by the multifrequency electric far field patterns at properly chosen sparse observation directions. Motivated by the constructive uniqueness, two indicator functions are then designed for locating the magnetic dipoles and the electric dipoles. After locating all the dipoles, the formulas for computing the corresponding polarization strengths are proposed. The stability of the formulas with respect to the frequency band is also derived. Finally, an indicator for the support of the extended sources is introduced once the dipoles are identified. Some numerical examples are presented to show the validity and robustness of the proposed algorithm.",

In this paper we present and analyze a constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method for convection diffusion equations. To define the multiscale basis functions, we first build an auxiliary multiscale space by solving local spectral problems motivated by analysis. Then a constraint energy minimization performed in the oversampling domains is exploited to construct the multiscale space. The resulting multiscale basis functions have a good decay property even for high contrast diffusion and convection coefficients. Furthermore, if the number of oversampling layers is chosen properly, we can prove that the convergence rate is proportional to the coarse meshsize. Our analysis also indicates that the size of the oversampling domain weakly depends on the contrast of the heterogeneous coefficients.

We address the problem of approximating the moments of the solution, [math], of an Itô stochastic differential equation (SDE) with drift and diffusion terms over a time grid [math]. In particular, we assume an explicit numerical scheme for the generation of sample paths [math] and then obtain recursive equations that yield any desired noncentral moment of [math] as a function of the initial condition [math]. The core of the methodology is the decomposition of the numerical solution [math] into a “central part” and an “effective noise” term. The central term is computed deterministically from the ordinary differential equation (ODE) that results from eliminating the diffusion term in the SDE, while the effective noise accounts for the stochastic deviation from the numerical solution of the ODE. For simplicity, we describe the proposed methodology based on an Euler–Maruyama integrator, but other explicit numerical schemes can be exploited in the same way. We also apply the moment approximations to construct estimates of the 1-dimensional marginal probability density functions of [math] based on a Gram–Charlier expansion. Both for the approximation of moments and 1-dimensional densities, we describe how to handle the cases in which the initial condition is fixed (i.e., [math] for some deterministic and known [math]) or random. In the latter case, we resort to polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) schemes in order to approximate the target moments. The methodology has been inspired by the PCE and differential algebra methods used for uncertainty propagation in astrodynamics problems. Hence, we illustrate its application for the quantification of uncertainty in a 2-dimensional Keplerian orbit perturbed by a Wiener noise process.",

By approximating the system as a compositional map between the gain and loss dynamics, the underlying nonlinear dynamics can be shown to be driven by energy balances in the systems. The gain-loss iterative mapping is similar to a normal form encoding for the pattern forming instabilities generated in such spatially extended systems. Similar to mode-locked lasers and rotating detonation engines, the underlying bifurcations persist for general forms of the loss and gain, both of which admit explicit representations in our approximation.

From the viewpoint of dynamics, the Lévy area correction introduces an additional deterministic torque into the rigid body motion equation on geometric rough paths.

This work makes explicit the degrees of freedom involved in modeling the dynamics of a network, or some other first-order property of a network, such as a measurement function. In previous work, an admissible function in a network was constructed through the evaluation of what we called oracle components. These oracle components are defined through some minimal properties that they are expected to obey. This is a high-level description in the sense that it is not clear how one could design such an object. The goal is to obtain a low-level representation of these objects by unwrapping them into their degrees of freedom. To achieve this, we introduce two decompositions. The first one is the more intuitive one and allows us to define the important concept of coupling order. The second decomposition is built on top of the first one and is valid for the class of coupling components that have finite coupling order. Despite this requirement, we show that this is still a very useful tool for designing coupling components with infinite coupling orders, through a limit approach.",

The synchronization stability of a complex network system of coupled phase oscillators is discussed. In case the network is affected by disturbances, a stochastic linearized system of the coupled phase oscillators may be used to determine the fluctuations of phase differences in the lines between the nodes and to identify the vulnerable lines that may lead to desynchronization. The main result is the derivation of the asymptotic variance matrices of the phase differences which characterizes the severity of the fluctuations. It is found that the cycle space of the graph of the system plays a role in this characterization. With theory of the cycle space, the effect of forming small cycles on the fluctuations is evaluated. It is proven that adding a new line or increasing the coupling strength of a line affects the fluctuations in the lines in any cycle including this line, while it does not affect the fluctuations in the other lines. In particular, if the phase differences at the synchronous state are not changed by these actions, then the affected fluctuations reduce.",

Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most debilitating symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease and is associated with falls and loss of independence. The patho-physiological mechanisms underpinning FOG are currently poorly understood. In this paper we combine time series analysis and mathematical modeling to study the FOG phenomenon’s dynamics. We focus on the transition from stepping in place into freezing and treat this phenomenon in the context of an escape from an oscillatory attractor into an equilibrium attractor state. We extract a discrete-time discrete-space Markov chain from experimental data and divide its state space into communicating classes to identify the transition into freezing. This allows us to develop a methodology for computationally estimating the time to freezing as well as the phase along the oscillatory (stepping) cycle of a patient experiencing Freezing Episodes (FE). The developed methodology is general and could be applied to any time series featuring transitions between different dynamic regimes including time series data from forward walking in people with FOG.",

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), also known as the circadian master clock, consists of a large population of oscillator neurons. Together, these neurons produce a coherent signal that drives the body’s circadian rhythms. What properties of the cell-to-cell communication allow the synchronization of these neurons, despite a wide range of environmental challenges such as fluctuations in photoperiods? To answer that question, we present a mean-field description of globally coupled neurons modeled as Goodwin oscillators with standard Gaussian noise. Provided that the initial conditions of all neurons are independent and identically distributed, any finite number of neurons becomes independent and has the same probability distribution in the mean-field limit, a phenomenon called propagation of chaos. This probability distribution is a solution to a Vlasov–Fokker–Planck type equation, which can be obtained from the stochastic particle model. We study, using the macroscopic description, how the interaction between external noise and intercellular coupling affects the dynamics of the collective rhythm, and we provide a numerical description of the bifurcations resulting from the noise-induced transitions. Our numerical simulations show a noise-induced rhythm generation at low noise intensities, while the SCN clock is arrhythmic in the high noise setting. Notably, coupling induces resonance-like behavior at low noise intensities, and varying coupling strength can cause period locking and variance dissipation even in the presence of noise.",

Kuramoto networks constitute a paradigmatic model for the investigation of collective behavior in networked systems. Despite many advances in recent years, many open questions remain on the solutions for systems composed of coupled Kuramoto oscillators on complex networks. In this article, we describe an algebraic method to find equilibria in this kind of system without approximation. To do this, we use a recently introduced algebraic approach to the Kuramoto dynamics, which results in an explicitly solvable complex-valued equation that captures the dynamics of the original Kuramoto model. Using this new approach, we obtain equilibria for both the nonlinear original Kuramoto and complex-valued systems considering the case of homogeneous natural frequency. We then completely classify all equilibria in the case of complete graphs originally studied by Kuramoto. Finally, we study equilibria in networks of coupled oscillators with phase-lag in generalized circulant networks, multilayer networks, and also random networks.",

The existence and uniqueness of the classical solution of the equation are proved so as to describe the optimal control strategy. After that, we find the optimal auction amount by determining the zero point of the derivative. We then show that the auction amount minimizing the total cost is unique in a special case.

We study the dynamics of unsaturated flows within a fluid-infused wet patch in a thin porous layer, coupled with the transport of passive particles, partly inspired by some art practice and environmental and industrial activities. The role of wetting and capillary forces and the influence of evaporation are both emphasized. Two coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) are first derived to describe the time evolution of the fluid saturation and concentration of passive particles. Three dimensionless parameters are identified after appropriate nondimensionalization of the coupled PDEs, the influence of which is demonstrated through asymptotic and numerical solutions at both the early and late times. With evaporation, in particular, the fluid front first arrives at a maximum location after an initial period of spreading. Thereafter, the front starts to recede until the fluid drains out at a finite time. Correspondingly, the concentration of particles blows up at a finite time, when the size of the wet region shrinks to zero. Meanwhile, the spatial distribution of particles evolves towards a universal curve near the front at late times, as the particles gradually accumulate at the front of the wet patch. It is recognized that, while the spreading of fluid within a porous layer behaves similar to that of a viscous gravity current subject to volume loss, the frontal structure for the concentration of particles, to some extent, is similar to that of an intruding inviscid gravity current.",

This formalism can accommodate patterns, waves, and oscillations in reaction-diffusion systems and neural field equations. To do this, we define the phase by precisely projecting the infinite-dimensional system onto the manifold of isometries. We outline a precise stochastic differential equation for the phase.

We analyse the dynamics of different routes to collapse of a constrained polyelectrolyte gel in contact with an ionic bath. The evolution of the gel is described by a model that incorporates non-linear elasticity, Stefan–Maxwell diffusion and interfacial gradient free energy to account for phase separation of the gel. A bifurcation analysis of the homogeneous equilibrium states reveals three solution branches at low ion concentrations in the bath, giving way to only one above a critical ion concentration. We present numerical solutions that capture both the spatial heterogeneity and the multiple timescales involved in the process of collapse. These solutions are complemented by two analytical studies. Firstly, a phase-plane analysis that reveals the existence of a depletion front for the transition from the highly swollen to the new collapsed equilibrium state. This depletion front is initiated after the fast ionic diffusion has set the initial condition for this time regime. Secondly, we perform a linear stability analysis about the homogeneous states that show that for a range of ion concentrations in the bath, spinodal decomposition of the swollen state gives rise to localized solvent-rich(poor) and, due to the electroneutrality condition, ion-poor(rich) phases that coarsen on the route to collapse.

The light-grating interaction excites gap solitons, a type of localized nonlinear coherent state which propagates with a central frequency in the forbidden band gap, resulting in a dramatically slower group velocity. Due to the nature of the band gap, a substantial amount of light is back-reflected by the grating’s strong reflective properties. We optimize, via a projected gradient descent method, the transmission efficiency of previously designed nonuniform grating structures in order to couple more slow light into the grating. We further explore the space of possible grating designs, using genetic algorithms, along with a previously unexplored design parameter: the grating chirp.

Malaria is one of the deadliest infectious diseases globally, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. It disproportionately affects young children, with two-thirds of fatalities occurring in under-fives. Individuals acquire protection from disease through repeated exposure, and this immunity plays a crucial role in the dynamics of malaria spread. We develop a novel age-structured PDE malaria model, which couples vector-host epidemiological dynamics with immunity dynamics. Our model tracks the acquisition and loss of antidisease immunity during transmission and its corresponding nonlinear feedback onto the transmission parameters. We derive the basic reproduction number ([math]) as the threshold condition for the stability of disease-free equilibrium; we also interpret [math] probabilistically as a weighted sum of cases generated by infected individuals at different infectious stages and different ages. We parametrize our model using demographic and immunological data from sub-Saharan regions. Numerical bifurcation analysis demonstrates the existence of an endemic equilibrium, and we observe a forward bifurcation in [math]. Our numerical simulations reproduce the heterogeneity in the age distributions of immunity profiles and infection status created by frequent exposure. Motivated by the recently approved RTS,S vaccine, we also study the impact of vaccination; our results show a reduction in severe disease among young children but a small increase in severe malaria among older children due to lower acquired immunity from delayed exposure.",

In contrast, for a general [math] (which may not be tree-structured), [math] samples are necessary to find an [math]-approximate tree. Our upper bound is based on a new conditional independence tester that addresses an open problem posed by Canonne et al. [Proceedings of the 50th Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM, 2018, pp. 735–748]: we prove that for three random variables [math] each over [math], testing if [math] is 0 or [math] is possible with [math] samples. Finally, we show that for a specific tree [math], with [math] samples from a distribution [math] over [math], one can efficiently learn the closest [math]-structured distribution in KL divergence by applying the add-1 estimator at each node.",

In the early 1990s, algorithms with [math] running time were presented for the planar case, and some years later an algorithm with [math] running time was presented for any [math]. Despite significant interest in subexponential exact algorithms over the past decade, there has been no progress on Metric TSP, except for a lower bound stating that the problem admits no [math] algorithm unless ETH fails. In this paper we settle the complexity of Metric TSP, up to constant factors in the exponent and under ETH, by giving an algorithm with running time [math].",
