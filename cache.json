Rapid and sensitive point-of-care testing on-farm or restaurants for batch inspection of pathogenic contamination in raw food products is essential. Here, we present an easy-to-design, cost-effective PAM-less Exonuclease-assisted Cas12A Nucleic-acid Detection (PECAN) assay paired with nucleic acid amplification systems for rapid and sensitive visual detection of 2 pathogenic Vibrio species: Vibrio parahaemolyticus (TDH) and Vibrio Cholerae (ctxA) without protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) site limitation. With T7 exonuclease, PAM-less detection could be achieved with a low concentration of cas12a, costing $0.8 USD per reaction. The system could also be adapted for PAM-less cas12a nucleic acid detection in-field or in-lab for sensitive DNA or RNA detection. We also constructed a low-cost reusable 3D printed heater chassis and reusable sodium acetate heat packs for field use without generating solid waste.",

          "description": "Profiling and comparing the performance of current widely used DNA targeting CRISPR systems provide the basic information for the gene-editing toolkit and can be a useful resource for this field. Herein we made a parallel comparison between the recently reported miniature Cas12f1 and the widely used Cas12a and Cas9 nucleases in mammalian cells. The results revealed that as a CRISPRa activator, Un1Cas12f1 could induce gene expression with a comparable level to these of Cas12a and Cas9, while as a cleaving editor, Cas12f1 exhibited similar properties to Cas12a, like high specificity and dominantly induced deletions over insertions, but with less activity. In contrast, wild-type SpCas9 showed the highest activity, lowest specificity, and induced balanced deletions over insertions. Thus, Cas12f1 is recommended for gene-activation-based applications, Cas12a is for therapy applications, and wild-type Cas9 is for in vitro and animal investigations. The comparison provided the editing properties of current widely used DNA-targeting CRISPR systems for the gene-editing field.",

Incorporation of more than one ncAA into a single construct can endow a protein with multiple useful features, such as unique molecular recognition and covalent crosslinking. Herein, for the first time, we encode two chemically distinct ncAAs into proteins prepared in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To complement ncAA incorporation in response to the amber (TAG) stop codon in yeast, we evaluated opal (TGA) stop codon suppression using three distinct orthogonal translation systems (OTSs): E. coli tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNATyr, E. coli leucyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNALeu, and M. alvus pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNAPy…",

We use these to generate improved synthetic circuits and optimise the co-expression of co-transfected cassettes, shedding light on how this can be useful for bioproduction and biotherapeutic applications.

          "description": "Cytoskeletal protein filaments such as actin and microtubules confer mechanical support to cells and facilitate many cellular functions such as motility and division. Recent years have witnessed the development of a variety of molecular scaffolds that mimic such cytoskeletal filaments. Indeed, filaments that are programmable and compatible with biological systems may prove useful in studying or substituting such proteins. Here, we explore the use of ssRNA tiles to build and modify cytoskeletal-like filaments in vitro. We engineer a number of functionalities that are crucial to the function of natural cytoskeletal systems into the ssRNA tiles, including the abilities to assemble or disassemble filaments, to tune the filament stiffness, to induce membrane binding, and to attach binding proteins. The work paves the way for building dynamic cell-like cytoskeletal systems made out of rationally designed ssRNA tiles that can be transcribed in natural or synthetic cells.",

          "description": "One-carbon (C1) feedstocks derived from CO2 and renewable electricity, such as formate, are promising substrates for sustainable production of chemicals, food and fuels. Energetically more efficient, engineered C1-fixation pathways were proposed to increase biomass yields above their natural counterparts, but have so far not been shown to achieve this. Here, we replace the native energy-inefficient Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle in Cupriavidus necator by genomic integration of the synthetic reductive glycine pathway for growth on formate. Our final engineered strain reaches a higher biomass yield than the CBB-cycle-utilizing wild type, showing for the first time that efficiencies found in natural metabolism can be exceeded via a synthetic pathway. This yield increase demonstrates the potential of synthetic metabolism and is an important step towards realizing truly sustainable, economically feasible bio-based production.",

          "description": "Sulfide-dependent THI4 thiazole synthases could potentially be used to replace plant cysteine-dependent suicide THI4s, whose high protein turnover rates make thiamin synthesis exceptionally energy-expensive. However, sulfide-dependent THI4s are anaerobic or microoxic enzymes and hence unadapted to the aerobic conditions in plants; they are also slow enzymes (kcat <1 h-1). To improve aerotolerance and activity, we applied continuous directed evolution under aerobic conditions in the yeast OrthoRep system to two sulfide-dependent bacterial THI4s. Six beneficial single mutations were identified, of which five lie in the active-site cleft predicted by structural modeling and two recapitulate features of naturally aerotolerant THI4s. That single mutations gave substantial improvements suggests that further advance under selection will be possible by stacking mutations. This proof-of-concept study established that the performance of sulfide-dependent THI4s in aerobic conditions is evolvable and, more generally, that yeast OrthoRep provides a plant-like bridge to adapt nonplant enzymes to work better in plants.",

          "description": "Methods for creating seamless genome modifications are an essential part of the microbial genetic toolkit that allows for strain engineering through the recycling of selectable markers. Here, we report the development of a method, termed SLICER, which can be used to create seamless genome modifications in D. radiodurans. We used SLICER to sequentially target four putative restriction-modification (R-M) system genes, recycling the same selective and screening markers for each subsequent deletion. A fifth R-M gene was replaced by a selectable marker to create a final D. radiodurans strain with 5 of the 6 putative R-M systems deleted. While we observed no significant increase in transformation efficiency, SLICER is a promising method to obtain a fully restriction-minus strain and expand the synthetic biology applications of D. radiodurans including as an in vivo DNA assembly platform.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=142 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/512367v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (57K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@aedc44org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ff2a0dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@121d419org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ebc232_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

          "description": "Whole-cell biosensors are emerging as promising tools for monitoring environmental pollutants such as heavy metals. These sensors constitute a genetic circuit comprising a sensing module and an output module, such that a detectable signal is produced in the presence of the desired analyte. The MerR family of metal-responsive regulators offers great potential for the construction of metal sensing circuits, due to their high sensitivity, tight transcription control and large diversity in metal-specificity. However, the sensing diversity is broadest in Gram-negative systems, while chassis organisms are often selected from Gram-positive species, particularly sporulating bacilli. This can be problematic, because Gram-negative biological parts, such as promoters, are frequently observed to be non-functional in Gram-positive hosts. Herein, we combined construction of synthetic genetic circuits and chimeric MerR regulators, supported by structure-guided design, to generate metal-sensitive biosensor modules that are functional in the biotechnological work-horse species Bacillus subtilis. These chimeras consist of a constant Gram-positive derived DNA-binding domain fused to variable metal binding domains of Gram-negative origins. To improve the specificity of the whole-cell biosensor, we developed a modular  AND gate logic system based on the B. subtilis natively split {sigma}-factor, SigO-RsoA, designed to maximise future use for synthetic biology applications in B. subtilis. This work provides insights into the use of modular regulators, such as the MerR family, in the design of synthetic circuits for the detection of heavy metals, with potential wider applicability of the approach to other systems and genetic backgrounds.",

          "description": "The IS200/IS605 family are abundant insertion sequences associated with one of the most numerous genes in nature, tnpB. Sequence homologies suggest that transposon-borne TnpB may be an evolutionary precursor to CRISPR-Cas system effector proteins, and TnpB has been shown to function as a Cas-like programmable DNA endonuclease. However, the role of TnpB in transposition and its contributions to genome dynamics remain elusive. Using a suite of fluorescent reporters coupled to transposition, we show that TnpB increases IS608-transposon activity and prevents transposon loss from genomes. Analyzing our results through a mathematical model of transposon dynamics, we discuss the multifaceted roles TnpB may play in transposon regulation. The mutually beneficial transposon-TnpB interaction may explain the prevalence of tnpB, creating conditions for the proliferation and appropriation of TnpBs RNA-guided endonuclease activity for adaptive immunity.",

To begin, the paper calculates the conditions for each population in the model to maintain the quantity stable and Hopf bifurcation when [math], [math], [math] is in the stable interval, and [math]. The crossing curves, their type, and the direction of the crossing curves are then obtained using the crossing curve method, which is composed of the threshold values of the dynamic behavior change on the two time-delays plane when [math]. The real data from the forage grass–Ochotona curzoniae–Buteo hemilasius food chain is used to conduct an empirical study of the model. When [math], the feasible region of the crossing curves is open-ended, and the model's crossing curves on the [math] plane are truncated. This indicates that the model's threshold distribution of dynamic behavior change is a regular curve made of several curves. The simulation using the time-delay value on the crossing curves shows that the model produces different dynamic behaviors such as stability, bifurcation, and chaos depending on the time-delay value on both sides of the curves. The critical values of dynamic behavior change are time-delay values on the crossing curves. The empirical study shows that increasing Ochotona curzoniae’s environmental capacity can easily cause Hopf bifurcation of the system. At this time, the number of each population in the Plateau ecosystem constantly fluctuates, and Ochotona curzoniae is vulnerable to extinction.",

Co-existing attractors are abundant in diverse systems ranging from climate to finance and ecological to social systems. In this article, we investigate a data-driven approach to infer different dynamics of a multistable system using an echo state network. We start with a parameter-aware reservoir and predict diverse dynamics for different parameter values. Interestingly, a machine is able to reproduce the dynamics almost perfectly even at distant parameters, which lie considerably far from the parameter values related to the training dynamics. In continuation, we can predict whole bifurcation diagram significant accuracy as well. We extend this study for exploring various dynamics of multistable attractors at an unknown parameter value. While we train the machine with the dynamics of only one attractor at parameter [math], it can capture the dynamics of a co-existing attractor at a new parameter value [math]. Continuing the simulation for a multiple set of initial conditions, we can identify the basins for different attractors. We generalize the results by applying the scheme on two distinct multistable systems.",

Recent machine-learning approaches to El Niño prediction, in particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown a surprisingly high skill at relatively long lead times. In an attempt to understand this high skill, we here use data from distorted physics simulations with the intermediate-complexity Zebiak–Cane model to determine what aspects of El Niño physics are represented in a specific CNN-based classification method. We find that the CNN can adequately correct for distortions in the ocean adjustment processes, but that the machine-learning method has far more trouble in dealing with distortions in upwelling feedback strength.",

In the present work, we consider a recently developed economic system that shows a richness of dynamical behavior. By means of the Lyapunov exponents, we analyze that there is overly complex behavior in the transitions in the dynamics of an isolated economy, oscillating between chaotic attractors and limit cycles. Then, for two coupled economies, we analyze the synchronization states for the space of all control parameters as a function of the network coupling parameter. Interestingly, we have evidenced that there is a broad region of fully synchronized states and as we increase the coupling, some phenomena such as a smooth and intermittent loss in synchronization emerge. In the same way, we observe phase synchronization for one of the control parameters. Ultimately, in order to confirm this loss of synchronization, we inspect the stability of synchronized states through the master stability function method for some control parameters. Here, we corroborate what was previously observed, the unexpected vast range of control parameter values of instability corresponding to desynchronization.",

Excitability arises thanks to a self-sustained local adaptation mechanism that drives the system on a slow timescale across a hysteretic phase transition involving states with different degrees of synchronization. These phenomena have been investigated for the Kuramoto model with bimodal distribution of the natural frequencies and for the Kuramoto model with inertia and a unimodal frequency distribution. We consider global and partial stimulation protocols and characterize the system response for different levels of dilution. We compare the results with those obtained in the fully coupled case showing that such collective phenomena are remarkably robust against network diluteness.",

Therefore, the problem we focus on is inferring the structure of the interactions in the swarm from the individual behavior trajectories. Similar inference problems that existed in network science are named network reconstruction or network inference. It is a fundamental problem pervading research on complex systems. In this paper, a new method, called Motion Trajectory Similarity, is developed for inferring direct interactions from the motion state of individuals in the swarm. It constructs correlations by combining the similarity of the motion trajectories of each cross section of the time series, in which individuals with highly similar motion states are more likely to interact with each other. Experiments on the flocking systems demonstrate that our method can produce a reliable interaction inference and outperform traditional network inference methods. It can withstand a high level of noise and time delay introduced into flocking models, as well as parameter variation in the flocking system, to achieve robust reconstruction. The proposed method provides a new perspective for inferring the interaction structure of a swarm, which helps us to explore the mechanisms of collective movement in swarms and paves the way for developing the flocking models that can be quantified and predicted.",

It is shown that, during the interaction of solitons of the same signs, the wave field is effectively smoothed out. When the number of solitons increases and the sequence of their amplitudes decay slower, the focused wave becomes even smoother and the statistical moments get frozen for a long time. This quasi-stationary state is characterized by greatly reduced statistical moments and by the density of solitons close to some critical value. This state may be treated as the small-dispersion limit, what makes it possible to analytically estimate all high-order statistical moments. While the focus of the study is made on the Korteweg–de Vries equation and its modified version, a much broader applicability of the results to equations that support soliton-type solutions is discussed.",

Here, we want to discuss, among others, the Jüttner probability density function (PDF). Both the velocity space and, consequently, the momentum space are not flat in special relativity. The velocity space corresponds to the Lobachevsky one, which has a negative curvature. This curvature induces a specific power for the Lorentz factor in the PDF, affecting the Jüttner normalization constant in one, two, and three dimensions. Furthermore, Jüttner distribution, written in terms of a more convenient variable, the rapidity, presents a curvature change at the origin at sufficiently high energy, which does not agree with our computational dynamics simulations of a relativistic gas. However, in one dimension, the rapidity satisfies a simple additivity law. This allows us to obtain, through the central limit theorem, a new, Lorentz-invariant, PDF whose curvature at the origin does not change for any energy value and which agrees with our computational dynamics simulations data. Also, we perform extensive first-principle simulations of a one-dimensional relativistic gas constituted by light and heavy particles.",

How to convert the stock data into a network is an open issue since the stock data are so large and their random volatility is strong. In this paper, a seasonal trend decomposition procedure based on the loess ([math]) method is applied to convert the stock time series into a directed and weighted symbolic network. Three empirical stock datasets, including the closing price of Shanghai Securities Composite Index, S&P 500 Index, and Nikkei 225 Index, are considered. The properties of these stock time series are revealed from the topological characteristics of corresponding symbolic networks. The results show that: (1) both the weighted indegree and outdegree distributions obey the power-law distribution well; (2) fluctuations of stock closing price are revealed by related network topological properties, such as weighting degree, betweenness, pageranks, and clustering coefficient; and (3) stock closing price, in particular, periods such as financial crises, can be identified by modularity class of the symbolic networks. Moreover, the comparison between the [math] method and the visibility graph further highlights the advantages of the [math] method in terms of the time complexity of the algorithm. Our method offers a new idea to study the network conversion of stock time series.",

In this work, we consider a quasiperiodically forced piecewise linear oscillator and show that strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) do exist in such nonsmooth systems. The generation and evolution mechanisms of SNAs are discussed. The torus-doubling, fractal, bubbling, and intermittency routes to SNAs are identified. The strange properties of SNAs are characterized with the aid of the phase sensitivity function, singular continuous spectrum, rational frequency approximation, and the path of the partial Fourier sum of state variables in a complex plane.

We show that it is possible through a variant of Parrondo’s paradox—the preference aggregation Parrondo’s paradox (PAPP). This new variant of Parrondo’s paradox makes use of an aggregate rule that combines with a decision-making heuristic that can be applied to individuals or parts of the social group.

Chimera states, where both synchronous and asynchronous activities of neurons co-exist in a single network, are particularly poignant examples of such patterns, whose dynamics and multistability may underlie brain function, such as cognitive tasks. However, dynamical mechanisms of coherent state formation in spiking neuronal networks as well as ways to control these states remain unclear. In this paper, we take a step in this direction by considering the evolution of chimera states in a network of class II excitable Morris–Lecar neurons with asymmetrical nonlocal inhibitory connections. Using the adaptive coherence measure, we are able to partition the network parameter space into regions of various collective behaviors (antiphase synchronous clusters, traveling waves, different types of chimera states as well as a spiking death regime) and have shown multistability between the various regimes. We track the evolution of the chimera states as a function of changed key network parameters and found transitions between various types of chimera states. We further find that the network can demonstrate long transients leading to quasi-persistence of activity patterns in the border regions hinting at near-criticality behaviors.",

However, understanding the underlying mechanism remains challenging. From social norms controlling human behavior to individual management of interpersonal relationships, rewards and punishments are some of the most commonly used measures. Through simulating the weak prisoner’s dilemma in finite populations, we find that neither a simple reward measure nor a pure punishment mechanism can extensively promote cooperation. Instead, a combination of appropriate punishment and reward mechanisms can promote cooperation’s prosperity regardless of how large or small the temptation to defect is. In addition, the combination spontaneously produces inhomogeneities in social relations and individual influence, which support the continued existence of cooperative behavior. Finally, we further explain how cooperators establish a sustainable existence under the combination by investigating the social relations at different moments in a small system. These results demonstrate that dispensing rewards and punishments impartially in society is essential to social harmony.",

Players with higher bank values are, thus, less likely to change strategy than players with a lower bank value.

To analyze the spread of infectious diseases among different areas, e.g., communities, cities, or countries, we construct a network, based on the epidemic model and the network coupling, whose nodes denote areas, and edges represent population migrations between two areas. Each node follows its dynamic, which describes an epidemic spreading among individuals in an area, and the node also interacts with other nodes, which indicates the spreading among different areas. By giving mathematical proof, we deduce that our model has a stable solution despite the network structure. We propose the peak infected ratio (PIR) as a property of infectious diseases in a certain area, which is not independent of the network structure. We find that increasing the population mobility or the disease infectiousness both cause higher peak infected population all over different by simulation. Furthermore, we apply our model to real-world data on COVID-19 and after properly adjusting the parameters of our model, the distribution of the peak infection ratio in different areas can be well fitted.",

Most models consider only a single preventive strategy and the case where multiple preventative actions are available is severely understudied. In our paper, we consider a very simple SI compartmental model of rabies in the domestic dog population. We study two choices of the dog owners: to vaccinate their dogs or to restrict the movements of unvaccinated dogs. We analyze the relatively rich patterns of Nash equilibria (NE). We show that there is always at least one NE at which the owners utilize only one form of prevention. However, there can be up to three different NEs at the same time: two NEs at which the owners use exclusively only the vaccination or movement restriction, and the third NE when the owners use both forms of prevention simultaneously. However, we also show that, unlike the first two types of NEs, the third kind of NE is not convergent stable.",

          "description": "Abstract\nDeriving emergent patterns from models of biological processes is a core concern of mathematical biology. In the context of partial differential equations, these emergent patterns sometimes appear as local minimisers of a corresponding energy functional. Here we give methods for determining the qualitative structure of local minimum energy states of a broad class of multi-species nonlocal advection–diffusion models, recently proposed for modelling the spatial structure of ecosystems. We show that when each pair of species respond to one another in a symmetric fashion (i.e. via mutual avoidance or mutual attraction, with equal strength), the system admits an energy functional that decreases in time and is bounded below. This suggests that the system will eventually reach a local minimum energy steady state, rather than fluctuating in perpetuity. We leverage this energy functional to develop tools, including a novel application of computational algebraic geometry, for making conjectures about the number and qualitative structure of local minimum energy solutions. These conjectures give a guide as to where to look for numerical steady state solutions, which we verify through numerical analysis. Our technique shows that even with two species, multi-stability with up to four classes of local minimum energy states can emerge. The associated dynamics include spatial sorting via aggregation and repulsion both within and between species. The emerging spatial patterns include a mixture of territory-like segregation as well as narrow spike-type solutions. Overall, our study reveals a general picture of rich multi-stability in systems of moving and interacting species.",

These growth rates correspond to average per-capita growth rates of one species with respect to an ergodic measure supporting other species. In the ecological literature, coexistence often is equated with the invasion growth rates being positive. Intuitively, positive invasion growth rates ensure that species recover from being rare. To provide a mathematically rigorous framework for this approach, we prove theorems that answer two questions: (i) When do the signs of the invasion growth rates determine coexistence? (ii) When signs are sufficient, which invasion growth rates need to be positive? We focus on deterministic models and equate …",

          "description": "Abstract\nAbsolute Concentration Robustness (ACR) was introduced by Shinar and Feinberg (Science 327:1389-1391, 2010) as robustness of equilibrium species concentration in a mass action dynamical system. Their aim was to devise a mathematical condition that will ensure robustness in the function of the biological system being modeled. The robustness of function rests on what we refer to as empirical robustness—the concentration of a species remains unvarying, when measured in the long run, across arbitrary initial conditions. Even simple examples show that the ACR notion introduced in Shinar and Feinberg (Science 327:1389-1391, 2010) (here referred to as static ACR) is neither necessary nor sufficient for empirical robustness. To make a stronger connection with empirical robustness, we define dynamic ACR, a property related to long-term, global dynamics, rather than only to equilibrium behavior. We discuss general dynamical systems with dynamic ACR properties as well as parametrized families of dynamical systems related to reaction networks. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for dynamic ACR in complex balanced reaction networks, a class of networks that is central to the theory of reaction networks.",

These two have been coupled before, but there is no general method for determining spatial distributions based on instantanous behavior coupled with population dynamics. We propose modeling interacting populations with instantaneous habitat choice through mean-field games. By using the framework of variational inequalities, we are able to determine existence and uniqueness for habitat distributions of interacting populations, in both continuous and discrete habitats. With some additional restrictions, we are also able to show existence and uniqueness of fixed-points of the population dynamics along with spatial distributions. We illustrate our theoretical results by studying a Rosenzweig–MacArthur model where predators and consumers inhabit a continuous habitat. This study is conducted both theoretically and numerically. Analyzing the emergent dynamics is possible as viewing the system from the vantage point of variational inequalities allows for applying efficient numerical methods. The generality of our theoretical approach opens up for studying complex ecosystems, e.g. the impact of enrichment on spatial distributions in marine ecosystems.",

Many achievements have been made in this respect, yet the mechanisms of uptake–diffusion feedback on the pattern structures of vegetation is not fully understood. To well reveal the influences of parameters perturbation on the pattern formation of vegetation, we give a comprehensive analysis on a vegetation–water model in the forms of reaction–diffusion equation which is posed by Zelnik et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci 112:12,327–12,331, 2015). We obtain the exact parameters range for stationary patterns and show the dynamical behaviors near the bifurcation point based on nonlinear analysis. It is found that the model has the properties of spot, labyrinth and gap patterns. Moreover, water diffusion rate prohibits the growth of vegetation while shading parameter promotes the increase of vegetation biomass. Our results show that gradual transitions from uniform state to gap pattern can occur for suitable value of parameters which may induce the emergence of desertification.",

In the case where the vaccination probability is zero, this model degenerates into a bond percolation model without the immunization. Using the method of generation functions, we obtain exact theoretical results for the epidemic threshold and the average outbreak size. From these exact solutions, we find that the epidemic threshold increases while the average outbreak size decreases with vaccination probability. Numerical simulations show that the size of giant component S increases with transmissibility T but decreases with the probability of vaccination. In addition, we compare the epidemic threshold and the size of the giant component for a Poisson network, an exponential network and a power-law network using numerical simulations. When the probability of vaccination is fixed, the epidemic threshold is the smallest for heterogeneous networks and the size of giant component S in homogeneous networks becomes largest for large transmissibility T(T close to 1).",

The model consists of cancer cells, cytotoxic T cells, and oxygen satisfying a system of partial differential equations. Some of the model parameters represent the effect of anti-cancer drugs. The tumor boundary is a free boundary whose dynamics is determined by the movement of cancer cells at the boundary. The model is simulated for radially symmetric and axially symmetric tumors, and it is shown that the tumor may increase or decrease in size, depending on the “strength\" of the drugs. Existence theorems are proved, global in-time in the radially symmetric case, and local in-time for any shape of tumor.

          "description": "Abstract\nDiscrete dynamical systems in which model components take on categorical values have been successfully applied to biological networks to study their global dynamic behavior. Boolean models in particular have been used extensively. However, multi-state models have also emerged as effective computational tools for the analysis of complex mechanisms underlying biological networks. Models in which variables assume more than two discrete states provide greater resolution, but this scheme introduces discontinuities. In particular, variables can increase or decrease by more than one unit in one time step. This can be corrected, without changing fixed points of the system, by applying an additional rule to each local activation function. On the other hand, if one is interested in cyclic attractors of their system, then this rule can potentially introduce new cyclic attractors that were not observed previously. This article makes some advancements in understanding the state space dynamics of multi-state network models with synchronous, sequential, or block-sequential update schedules and establishes conditions under which no new cyclic attractors are added to networks when the additional rule is applied. Our analytical results have the potential to be incorporated into modeling software and aid researchers in their analyses of biological multi-state networks.",

The operating diagrams give the asymptotic behavior of the model with respect to the four operating parameters, which are the dilution rate and the three inflowing concentrations of the substrates. These diagrams were obtained only numerically in the existing literature. Using the mathematical analysis of this model obtained in our previous studies, we construct the operating diagrams, by plotting the curves that separate their various regions. Hence, the regions of the operating diagrams are constructed analytically and there is no requirement for time-consuming algorithms to generate the plots, as in the numerical method. Moreover, our method reveals behaviors that have not been detected in the previous numerical studies. The growth functions are of Monod form with the inclusion of a product inhibition term. However, our method applies for a large class of growth functions. We construct operating diagrams with and without maintenance showing the role of maintenance on the stability of the system.",

We show that recording each infected individual’s infection age, i.e., the time elapsed since infection, has three benefits. First, regardless of the number of types, the age distribution of the population can be described by means of a first-order, one-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE) known as the McKendrick-von Foerster equation. The frequency of type i is simply obtained by integrating the probability of being in state i at a given age against the age distribution. This representation induces a simple methodology based on the additional assumption of Poisson sampling to infer and forecast the epidemic. We illustrate this technique using French data from the COVID-19 epidemic. Second, our approach generalizes and simplifies standard compartmental models using high-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to account for disease complexity. We show that such models can always be rewritten in our framework, thus, providing a low-dimensional yet equivalent representation of these complex models. Third, beyond the simplicity of the approach, we show that our population model naturally appears as a universal scaling limit of a large class of fully stochastic individual-based epidemic models, where the initial condition of the PDE emerges as the limiting age structure of an exponentially growing population starting from a single individual.",

It is a well-recognised challenge to understand the effects of noise on the stability of such networks. We demonstrate that the patterns of activity generated by networks of grid cells emerge from the instability of homogeneous activity for small levels of noise. This is carried out by analysing the robustness of network activity patterns with respect to noise in an upscaled noisy grid cell model in the form of a system of partial differential equations. Inhomogeneous network patterns are numerically understood as branches bifurcating from unstable homogeneous states for small noise levels. We show that there is a phase transition occurring as the level of noise decreases.

In addition to usual issues (data often incomplete and noisy), epidemics of the same nature may be observed in several places or over different periods. The resulting possible inter-epidemic variability is rarely explicitly considered. Here, we propose to tackle multiple epidemics through a unique model incorporating a stochastic representation for each epidemic and to jointly estimate its parameters from noisy and partial observations. By building on a previous work for prevalence data, a Gaussian state-space model is extended to a model with mixed effects on the parameters describing simultaneously several epidemics and their observation process. An appropriate inference method is developed, by coupling the SAEM algorithm with Kalman-type filtering. Moreover, we consider here incidence data, which requires to develop a new version of the filtering algorithm. Its performances are investigated on SIR simulated epidemics for prevalence and incidence data. Our method outperforms an inference method separately processing each dataset. An application to SEIR influenza outbreaks in France over several years using incidence data is also carried out. Parameter estimations highlight a non-negligible variability between influenza seasons, both in transmission and case reporting. The main contribution of our study is to rigorously and explicitly account for the inter-epidemic variability between multiple outbreaks, both from the viewpoint of modeling and inference with a parsimonious statistical model.",

The Laplace function is utilized to approximate the tensor multi-rank, and the total variation regularization is added to improve the local piecewise smoothness and preserve the edges of the restored tensor data. An efficient alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed to tackle the tensor completion model, and its convergence theorem is also derived.

          "description": "Abstract\nMultilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) has become an important methodology in applied mathematics for reducing the computational cost of weak approximations. For many problems, it is well-known that strong pairwise coupling of numerical solutions in the multilevel hierarchy is needed to obtain efficiency gains. In this work, we show that strong pairwise coupling indeed is also important when MLMC is applied to stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) of reaction-diffusion type, as it can improve the rate of convergence and thus improve tractability. For the MLMC method with strong pairwise coupling that was developed and studied numerically on filtering problems in (Chernov in Num Math 147:71-125, 2021), we prove that the rate of computational efficiency is higher than for existing methods. We also provide numerical comparisons with alternative coupling ideas on linear and nonlinear SPDE to illustrate the importance of this feature.",

In this paper, a non-polynomial WENO finite difference scheme in order to enhance the local accuracy is proposed. For a non-polynomial interpolation basis, the infinitely smooth RBFs such as the multi-quadratic are adopted. By optimizing the free parameter in RBFs, the local error generated by the RBFs interpolation can be easily controlled. The formulation of scheme will be described in detail and numerical tests have been prepared to demonstrate the efficiency of the scheme in one and two-dimension.

Thanks to its physics-based structure, ensured by the use of a Galerkin projection of the full order model (FOM) onto a linear low-dimensional subspace, the Galerkin-RB method yields approximations that fulfill the differential problem at hand. However, to make the assembling of the ROM independent of the FOM dimension, intrusive and expensive hyper-reduction techniques, such as the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), are usually required, thus making this strategy less feasible for problems characterized by (high-order polynomial or nonpolynomial) nonlinearities. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a novel strategy for learning nonlinear ROM operators using deep neural networks (DNNs). The resulting hyper-reduced order model enhanced by DNNs, to which we refer to as Deep-HyROMnet, is then a physics-based model, still relying on the RB method approach, however employing a DNN architecture to approximate reduced residual vectors and Jacobian matrices once a Galerkin projection has been performed. Numerical results dealing with fast simulations in nonlinear structural mechanics show that Deep-HyROMnets are orders of magnitude faster than POD-Galerkin-DEIM ROMs, still ensuring the same level of accuracy.",

To derive optimal order a posteriori error estimates, quadratic reconstructions for the IMEX BDF2 method are introduced. By using these continuous, piecewise time reconstructions, the upper and lower error bounds depending only on the discretization parameters and the data of the problems are derived.

In particular, we consider a first order hyperbolic model of turbulent shallow water flows, as well as the unified first order hyperbolic Godunov–Peshkov–Romenski (GPR) model of continuum mechanics, which is able to describe at the same time viscous fluids and nonlinear elastic solids at large deformations. Both PDE systems treated in this paper belong to the class of hyperbolic and thermodynamically compatible systems, since both satisfy an entropy inequality and the total energy conservation can be obtained as a direct consequence of all other governing equations via suitable linear combination with the corresponding thermodynamic dual variables. In this paper, we mimic this process for the first time also at the semi-discrete level at the aid of high order discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes. For the GPR model we directly discretize the entropy inequality and obtain total energy conservation as a consequence of a suitable discretization of all other evolution equations. For turbulent shallow water flows we directly discretize the nonconservative evolution equations related to the Reynolds stress tensor and obtain total energy conservation again as a result of the thermodynamically compatible discretization. As a consequence, for continuum mechanics the new DG schemes satisfy a cell entropy inequality directly by construction and thanks to the discrete thermodynamic compatibility they are provably nonlinearly stable in the energy norm for both systems under consideration.",

Indeed, we derive two reliable and efficient residual-based a posteriori error estimators for this problem on arbitrary (convex or non-convex) polygonal and polyhedral regions. The reliability of the proposed estimators draws mainly upon the uniform ellipticity and inf-sup condition of the forms involved, a suitable assumption on the data, stable Helmholtz decompositions in Hilbert and Banach frameworks, and the local approximation properties of the Clément and Raviart–Thomas operators. In turn, inverse inequalities, the localization technique based on bubble functions, and known results from previous works, are the main tools yielding the efficiency estimate.

Through the process, the authors establish the equivalence between the SDRT method and the flux reconstruction (FR) approach under the assumption of the linearity of the flux and the mesh uniformity. Such a connection allows building a new family of FR schemes for two and three-dimensional simplexes and also to recover the well-known FR-SD method with tensor-product elements. In addition, a thorough analysis of the numerical dissipation and dispersion of both aforementioned schemes and the nodal discontinuous Galerkin FR (FR-DG) method with two and three-dimensional elements is proposed through the use of the combined-mode Fourier approach. SDRT is shown to possess an enhanced temporal linear stability in comparison to FR-DG. On the contrary, SDRT displays larger dissipation and dispersion errors with respect to FR-DG. Finally, the study is concluded with a set of numerical experiments, the linear advection-diffusion problem, the Isentropic Euler Vortex, and the Taylor-Green Vortex (TGV). The latter test case shows that SDRT schemes present a non-linear unstable behavior with simplex elements and certain polynomial degrees. For the sake of completeness, the matrix form of the SDRT method is developed and the computational performance of SDRT with respect to FR schemes is evaluated using GPU architectures.",

          "description": "Abstract\nMatrix and tensor nuclear norms have been successfully used to promote the low-rankness of tensors in low-rank tensor completion. However, singular value decomposition (SVD), which is computationally expensive for large-scale matrices, frequently appears in solving those nuclear norm minimization models. Based on the tensor-tensor product (T-product), in this paper, we first establish the equivalence between the so-called transformed tubal nuclear norm for a third-order tensor and the minimum of the sum of two factor tensors’ squared Frobenius norms under a general invertible linear transform. Gainfully, we introduce a mode-unfolding (often named as “spatio-temporal” in the internet traffic data recovery literature) regularized tensor completion model that is able to efficiently exploit the hidden structures of tensors. Then, we propose an implementable alternating minimization algorithm to solve the underlying optimization model. It is remarkable that our approach does not require any SVDs and all subproblems of our algorithm enjoy closed-form solutions. A series of numerical experiments on traffic data recovery, color images and videos inpainting demonstrate that our SVD-free approach takes less computing time to achieve satisfactory accuracy than some state-of-the-art tensor nuclear norm minimization approaches.",

Nevertheless, those methods are all constructed based on knowing the exact values of the derivatives of the source term. Therefore, this drawback mostly prevents their actual applications as the analytic form of the source term is rarely available. In this paper, we propose a sixth-order quasi-compact difference method, without having to know the derivatives of the source term, for solving the 2D and 3D Poisson equations. Our strategy is to discretize the equation by the fourth-order compact scheme at the improper interior grid points that adjoin the boundary, while the sixth-order scheme, where it is compact only for the unknowns, is exploited to the proper interior grid points that are not adjoining the boundary. Theoretically, we rigorously prove that the proposed method can achieve the global sixth-order accuracy. Since there are no derivatives of the source term involved in the proposed scheme, our global sixth-order quasi-compact difference method can be developed to solve the time-dependent problems using a time advancing scheme. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the convergence order and the efficiency of the proposed methods.",

Adaptive Galerkin methods for time-dependent partial differential equations are studied and shown to be dissipative. The adaptation implies that the subset of the selected basis function changes over time according to the evolution of the solution. The corresponding projection operator is thus time-dependent and nondifferentiable. We therefore propose to use an integral formulation in time. We analyze the existence and uniqueness of this weak form of the dynamical Galerkin scheme, and we then prove that the nonsmooth projection operator introduces energy dissipation, which is a crucial result for adaptive Galerkin methods, e.g., adaptive wavelet methods. Numerical examples for the inviscid Burgers equation in one dimension and the incompressible Euler equations in two and three spatial dimensions show that the selection of basis functions, for instance by filtering out weak wavelet coefficients from the solution, introduces energy dissipation. Moreover, for the Burgers case we can show that adaptive wavelet regularization yields convergence of the truncated Galerkin solution to the physically relevant entropy solution. These results motivate adaptive wavelet-based Galerkin schemes for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws.",

In this paper, an online multiscale model reduction method is presented for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with multiplicative noise, where the diffusion coefficient is spatially multiscale and the noise perturbation nonlinearly depends on the diffusion dynamics. It is necessary to efficiently compute all possible trajectories of the stochastic dynamics for quantifying a model’s uncertainty and statistic moments. The multiscale diffusion and nonlinearity may cause the computation to become very intractable. To overcome the multiscale difficulty, a constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) is used to localize the computation and obtain an effective coarse model. However, the nonlinear terms are still defined on a fine scale space after the Galerkin projection of CEM-GMsFEM is applied to the nonlinear SPDEs. This significantly impacts the simulation efficiency by CEM-GMsFEM. To this end, a stochastic online discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) is proposed to treat the stochastic nonlinearity. The stochastic online DEIM incorporates offline snapshots and online snapshots. The offline snapshots consist of the nonlinear terms at the approximate mean of the stochastic dynamics and are used to construct an offline reduced model. The online snapshots contain some information of the current new trajectory and are used to correct the offline reduced model in an incremental manner. The stochastic online DEIM substantially reduces the dimension of the nonlinear dynamics and enhances the prediction accuracy for the reduced model. Thus, the online multiscale model reduction is constructed by using CEM-GMsFEM and the stochastic online DEIM. A priori error analysis is carried out for the nonlinear SPDEs. We present a few numerical examples with diffusion in heterogeneous porous media and show the effectiveness of the proposed model reduction.",

We begin with a semidiscretization of the Dirac equation in time by a time-splitting method, followed by a full-discretization in space by with the Fourier pseudospectral method in space. By employing the unitary flow property of the second-order time-splitting method for the Dirac equation, we prove uniform error bounds for [math] at [math] and [math] for the semidiscretization and full-discretization, respectively, for any time [math] with [math] and [math].

Pattern formation arising from the reaction-diffusion epidemic model is a space-time depiction of the distribution and transmission of infectious diseases. Disease control can be achieved by controlling the associated pattern formations. For an SIR reaction-diffusion epidemic model, we review its Turing pattern formations with different transmission rates under the case of a constant recovery rate. To control pattern formations of the SIR epidemic model, we introduce a regulator as a control function of the recovery rate. For a perfect control strategy, it not only leads to a desired pattern formation, but also has a small support in space-time domains. In order to obtain such a control strategy, we propose a sparse optimal control problem governed by the SIR epidemic model. We study the existence of optimal solutions, derive the first order necessary optimality system, obtain the sparsity structure of the control function, and numerically solve the control problem. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectivity of our method.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Volume 82, Issue 5, Page 1791-1807, December 2022. \n Abstract. In mathematical modeling, it is common to have an equation [math], where the exact form of [math] is not known. This article shows that there are large classes of [math] where almost all [math] share the same properties. The classes we investigate are vector spaces [math] of [math] functions [math] that satisfy the following condition: [math] has “almost constant rank\" (ACR) if there is a constant integer [math] such that rank[math] for “almost every\" [math] and almost every [math]. If the vector space [math] is finite dimensional, then “almost every\" is with respect to the Lebesgue measure on [math], and otherwise, it means almost every in the sense of prevalence, as described herein. Most function spaces commonly used for modeling purposes are ACR. In particular, we show that if all of the functions in [math] are linear or polynomial or real analytic, or if [math] is the set of all functions in a “structured system\", then [math] is ACR. For each [math] and [math], the solution set of [math] is SolSet[math]. A solution set of [math] is called robust if it persists despite small changes in [math] and [math]. The following two global results are proved for almost every [math] in an ACR vector space [math]: (1) Either the solution set SolSet[math] is robust for almost every [math], or none of the solution sets are robust. (2) The solution set SolSet[math] is a [math]-manifold of dimension [math]. In particular, [math] is the same for almost every [math].",

A matrix basis formulation is introduced to represent the [math] frequency domain dyadic Green’s functions of Maxwell’s equations in 3-dimensional layered media. The formulation can be used to decompose the Maxwell’s Green’s functions into independent TE and TM components, each satisfying a scalar Helmholtz equation. Moreover, the interface transmission conditions for the electromagnetic fields can be reduced to decoupled conditions for the matrix basis coefficients at interfaces. Numerical results for the electric and magnetic dyadic Green’s functions for a 10-layer medium show the capability of the proposed formulation.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Volume 82, Issue 5, Page 1680-1709, December 2022. \n Abstract. In this paper, we formulate susceptible-infected-susceptible reaction-diffusion epidemic models with cognition and show the impact of movement strategies on disease outbreak and mitigation under a spatially heterogeneous environment. The cognitive diffusion either takes a Fokker–Planck type diffusion obtained by Chapman’s diffusion law (called random diffusion) or follows Fick’s diffusion law (called symmetric diffusion). We derive a variational expression of the basic reproduction number [math] for both models and prove that the disease-free equilibrium is unique and globally asymptotically stable if [math]. Furthermore, if [math], the model following Fick’s diffusion law admits at least one endemic equilibrium and the model following Chapman’s diffusion law has a unique endemic equilibrium. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations, which additionally show the segregation phenomenon between susceptible and infected populations regulated by different movement strategies. Spatial segregation here is natural, not caused by an isolation policy, and thus is the most important indicator for an infectious disease to spread or wane in the absence of intervention. The first example shows that a heterogeneous random diffusion segregates infected and susceptible populations further than an ODE model and thus reduces the infection size. However, symmetric diffusion never does that. The second example shows that a heterogeneous random diffusion detriments segregation but still reduces the infection severity by moving infected individuals to a disease-free region. In a certain situation, a heterogeneous random diffusion may increase the infection severity as shown in the last example.",

We investigate the transfer function emanating from the linearization of a car-following model for human drivers when taking into account their reaction time, which is known to be a cause of the stop-and-go traffic phenomenon. This leads to a nonrational transfer function, implying nontrivial stability conditions which are explicitly given. They are in particular satisfied whenever string stability holds. We also show how this reaction time can introduce a partial string stability, where the transfer function modulus remains smaller than 1 up to some critical frequency. We explore conditions in the parameter space discriminating between 3 different regimes (stability, string stability, and partial string stability).",
