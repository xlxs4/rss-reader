          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose a new approach for the time-discretization of the incompressible stochastic Stokes equations with multiplicative noise. Our new strategy is based on the classical Milstein method from stochastic differential equations. We use the energy method for its error analysis and show a strong convergence order of nearly 1 for both velocity and pressure approximations. The proof is based on a new Hölder continuity estimate of the velocity solution. While the errors of the velocity approximation are estimated in the standard \n                      \n                      \\(L^2\\)\n                      \n                    - and \n                      \n                      \\(H^1\\)\n                      \n                    -norms, the pressure errors are carefully analyzed in a special norm because of the low regularity of the pressure solution. In addition, a new interpretation of the pressure solution, which is very useful in computation, is also introduced. Numerical experiments are also provided to validate the error estimates and their sharpness.",

Besides the velocity and pressure variables, the symmetric stress and the skew-symmetric vorticity tensors are introduced as auxiliary unknowns of the fluid. Thus, the incompressibility condition allows to eliminate the pressure, which, along with the velocity gradient and the shear stress, can be computed afterwards via postprocessing formulae depending on the velocity and the aforementioned new tensors.

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we investigate inverse obstacle scattering problems in acoustic waveguides with low-frequency data. A Bayesian inference scheme, combining a multi-fidelity strategy and surrogate model with guided modes and a deep neural network is proposed to reconstruct the shapes of unknown scattering objects. First, the inverse problem is reformulated as a statistical inference problem using Bayes’ formula, which provides statistical characteristics of the posterior distribution and quantification of the uncertainties. The well-posedness of the posterior distribution is proved by using the f-divergence. Subsequently, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is used to explore the posterior density. We propose a new multi-fidelity surrogate model to accelerate the sampling procedure while maintaining high accuracy. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that this method not only produces high-quality reconstructions but also substantially reduces computational costs.",

Theoretically, we analyze the properties of the function and the minimizers of its associated proximal problem. Since the proximal problem has no closed-form solution, we propose a derivative-free Nelder-Mead simplex based selection algorithm to find the global minimizer. To reduce the computational cost, we only solve a small 1D problem and then use the 1D solution template as a look-up table to interpolate high-dimension data. Moreover, we consider a variational model based on the proposed image prior. Then we use the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm on the nonconvex model to derive efficient numerical algorithms. Various experiments on image denoising, image deblurring, and image reconstruction demonstrate that the proposed nonconvex prior is competitive with the existing priors. In particular, it outperforms others in recovering piecewise constant images.",

Chemical reactions can be modeled by a random time-changed Poisson process on countable states. The macroscopic behaviors, such as large fluctuations, can be studied via the WKB reformulation. The WKB reformulation for the backward equation is Varadhan’s discrete nonlinear semigroup and is also a monotone scheme that approximates the limiting first-order Hamilton–Jacobi equations (HJE). The discrete Hamiltonian is an m-accretive operator, which generates a nonlinear semigroup on countable grids and justifies the well-posedness of the chemical master equation and the backward equation with “no reaction” boundary conditions. The convergence from the monotone schemes to the viscosity solution of HJE is proved by constructing barriers to overcome the polynomial growth coefficients in the Hamiltonian. This implies the convergence of Varadhan’s discrete nonlinear semigroup to the continuous Lax–Oleinik semigroup and leads to the large deviation principle for the chemical reaction process at any single time. Consequently, the macroscopic mean-field limit reaction rate equation is recovered with a concentration rate estimate. Furthermore, we establish the convergence from a reversible invariant measure to an upper semicontinuous viscosity solution of the stationary HJE.",

We study a Stokes system posed in a thin perforated layer with a Navier-slip condition on the internal oscillating boundary from two viewpoints: (1) dimensional reduction of the layer and (2) homogenization of the perforated structure. Assuming the perforations are periodic, both aspects can be described through a small parameter [math], which is related to the thickness of the layer as well as the size of the periodic structure. By letting [math] tend to zero, we prove that the sequence of solutions converges to a limit which satisfies a well-defined macroscopic problem. More precisely, the limit velocity and limit pressure satisfy a two pressure Stokes model, from which a Darcy law for thin layers can be derived.

Coarse-scale surrogate models in the context of numerical homogenization of linear elliptic problems with arbitrary rough diffusion coefficients rely on the efficient solution of fine-scale subproblems on local subdomains whose solutions are then employed to deduce appropriate coarse contributions to the surrogate model. However, in the absence of periodicity and scale separation, the reliability of such models requires the local subdomains to cover the whole domain which may result in high offline costs, in particular for parameter-dependent and stochastic problems. This paper justifies the use of neural networks for the approximation of coarse-scale surrogate models by analyzing their approximation properties. For a prototypical and representative numerical homogenization technique, the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition method, we show that one single neural network is sufficient to approximate the coarse contributions of all occurring coefficient-dependent local subproblems for a nontrivial class of diffusion coefficients up to arbitrary accuracy. We present rigorous upper bounds on the depth and number of nonzero parameters for such a network to achieve a given accuracy. Further, we analyze the overall error of the resulting neural network enhanced numerical homogenization surrogate model.",

We study the quantitative homogenization of linear second order elliptic equations in nondivergence form with highly oscillating periodic diffusion coefficients and with large drifts, in the so-called centered setting where homogenization occurs and the large drifts contribute to the effective diffusivity. Using the centering condition and the invariant measures associated with the underlying diffusion process, we transform the equation into divergence form with modified diffusion coefficients but without drift.

This work concerns the asymptotic analysis of high-frequency wave propagation in randomly layered media with fast variations and long-range correlations. The analysis takes place in the three-dimensional physical space and weak-coupling regime. The role played by the slow decay of the correlations on a propagating pulse is twofold. First we observe a random travel time characterized by a fractional Brownian motion that appears to have a standard deviation larger than the pulse width, which is in contrast with the standard O’Doherty–Anstey theory for random propagation media with mixing properties. Second, a deterministic pulse deformation is described as the solution of a paraxial wave equation involving a pseudodifferential operator. This operator is characterized by the autocorrelation function of the medium fluctuations. In case of fluctuations with long-range correlations this operator is close to a fractional Weyl derivative whose order, between 2 and 3, depends on the power decay of the autocorrelation function. In the frequency domain, the pseudodifferential operator exhibits a frequency-dependent power-law attenuation with exponent corresponding to the order of the fractional derivative, and a frequency-dependent phase modulation, both ensuring the causality of the limiting paraxial wave equation as well as the Kramers–Kronig relations. The mathematical analysis is based on an approximation-diffusion theorem for random ordinary differential equations with long-range correlations.",

Recent advances in high-resolution experimental methods have highlighted the significance of cell signal pathway crosstalk and localized signaling activity in the development and disease of numerous biological systems. The investigation of multiple signal pathways often introduces different methods of cell-cell communication, i.e., contact-based or diffusive signaling, which generates both a spatial and a temporal dependence on cell behaviors. Motivated by cellular mechanisms that control cell-fate decisions in developing bilayer tissues, we use dynamical systems coupled with multilayer graphs to analyze the role of signaling polarity and pathway crosstalk in fine-grain pattern formation of protein activity. Specifically, we study how multilayer graph edge structures and weights influence the layerwise (laminar) patterning of cells in bilayer structures, which are commonly found in glandular tissues. We present sufficient conditions for the existence, uniqueness, and instability of homogeneous cell states in the large-scale spatially discrete dynamical system. Using methods of pattern templating by graph partitioning to generate quotient systems, in combination with concepts from monotone dynamical systems, we exploit the extensive dimensionality reduction to provide existence conditions for the polarity required to induce fine-grain laminar patterns with multiple spatially dependent intracellular components. We then explore the spectral links between the quotient and large-scale dynamical systems to extend the laminar patterning criteria from existence to convergence for sufficiently large amounts of cellular polarity in the large-scale dynamical system, independent of spatial dimension and number of cells in the tissue.",

We propose to adopt statistical regression as the projection operator to enable data-driven learning of the operators in the Mori–Zwanzig formalism. We present a principled method to extract the Markov and memory operators for any regression models. We show that the choice of linear regression results in a recently proposed data-driven learning algorithm based on Mori’s projection operator, which is a higher-order approximate Koopman learning method. We show that more expressive nonlinear regression models naturally fill in the gap between the highly idealized and computationally efficient Mori’s projection operator and the most optimal yet computationally infeasible Zwanzig’s projection operator. We performed numerical experiments and extracted the operators for an array of regression-based projections, including linear, polynomial, spline, and neural network–based regressions, showing a progressive improvement as the complexity of the regression model increased. Our proposition provides a general framework to extract memory-dependent corrections and can be readily applied to an array of data-driven learning methods for stationary dynamical systems in the literature.",

To address noise inherent in electronic data acquisition systems and real-world sources, Araki et al. [Phys. D, 417 (2021), 132819] demonstrated a grid-based nonlinear technique to remove noise from a chaotic signal, leveraging a clean high-fidelity signal from the same dynamical system and ensemble averaging in multidimensional phase space. This method achieved denoising of a time series data with 100% added noise but suffered in regions of low data density. To improve this grid-based method, here an unstructured mesh based on triangulations and Voronoi diagrams is used to accomplish the same task. The unstructured mesh more uniformly distributes data samples over mesh cells to improve the accuracy of the reconstructed signal.

A homogenized model is developed to describe the interaction between aligned strings and an incompressible, viscous, Newtonian fluid. In the case of many strings, the ratio of string separation to domain width gives a small parameter which can be exploited to simplify the problem. Model derivation using multiscale asymptotics results in a modified Darcy law for fluid flow, with coefficients determined by averaged solutions to microscale problems. Fluid flow is coupled to solid deformation via a homogenized force balance obtained by coarse-graining the balance on each string. This approach offers an alternative method to systematically derive the equations governing the interaction of Stokes flow with many flexible structures. The resulting model of fluid-structure interaction is reduced to a single scalar, linear, partial differential equation by introducing a potential for the pressure. Analytical solutions are presented for a cylindrical geometry subject to time-harmonic motion of the string ends. Scaling laws are identified that describe the variation of shear stress exerted on the string surface with the forcing frequency.",

We show that the switching rate provides a powerful mechanism for controlling the densities of spontaneously emerging aggregates. Specifically, in two- and three-dimensional settings it is shown that when both switching rates coincide and are suitably large, the densities of both the chemotaxing and the secreting populations will exceed any prescribed level at some points in the considered domain.

We propose a non-local model for contact guidance and steric hindrance depending on a single external cue, namely the extracellular matrix, that affects in a twofold way the polarization and speed of motion of the cells. We start from a microscopic description of the stochastic processes underlying the cell re-orientation mechanism related to the change of cell speed and direction. Then, we formally derive the corresponding kinetic model that implements exactly the prescribed microscopic dynamics, and, from it, it is possible to deduce the macroscopic limit in the appropriate regime. Moreover, we test our model in several scenarios. In particular, we numerically investigate the minimal microscopic mechanisms that are necessary to reproduce cell dynamics by comparing the outcomes of our model with some experimental results related to breast cancer cell migration. This allows us to validate the proposed modeling approach and to highlight its capability of predicting qualitative cell behaviors in diverse heterogeneous microenvironments.",

Here, a planar pattern consists of many big patches, and a big patch can be regarded as combination of many patches on the plane. The consumer moves between patches asymmetrically, while the asymmetry is driven by the resource abundance. Based on experimental models with linearly-linked patches, we propose a planarly-linked-patch model with asymmetric dispersal. Using dynamical systems theory, we show global stability of equilibria in the model, and demonstrate how the resource-driven dispersal forms patterns. It is shown that appropriate asymmetry in dispersal would make the consumer persist in the system, even in sink patches. The asymmetry could also make the consumer’s total population abundance larger than that without dispersal. However, inappropriate asymmetry would make the consumer go into extinction, even in source patches. Dispersal rates are also shown to play a role in the persistence and abundance increase. Our results are consistent with experimental observations and provide new insights. Numerical simulations by the model reproduce various vegetation patterns in the real world.

Competitive systems can exhibit both hierarchical (transitive) and cyclic (intransitive) structures. Despite theoretical interest in cyclic competition, which offers richer dynamics and occupies a larger subset of the scope of possible competitive systems, most real-world systems are predominantly transitive. Why? Here, we introduce a generic mechanism that promotes transitivity, even when there is ample room for cyclicity. We demonstrate that, if competitive outcomes depend smoothly on competitor attributes, then similar competitors compete transitively. We quantify the rate of convergence to transitivity given the similarity of the competitors and the smoothness of the performance function. Thus, we prove the adage regarding apples and oranges. Similar objects admit well-ordered comparisons; diverse objects may not.",

We consider the inverse medium scattering of reconstructing the medium contrast using Born data, including the full-aperture, limited-aperture, and multifrequency data. We propose data-driven basis functions for these inverse problems based on the generalized prolate spheroidal wave functions and related eigenfunctions. Such data-driven eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of a Fourier integral operator; they remarkably extend analytically to the whole space, are doubly orthogonal, and are complete in the class of band-limited functions. We first establish a Picard criterion for reconstructing the contrast using the data-driven basis, where the reconstruction formula can also be understood from the viewpoint of data processing and analytic extrapolation. Another salient feature associated with the generalized prolate spheroidal wave functions is that the data-driven basis for a disk is also a basis for a Sturm–Liouville differential operator. With the help of Sturm–Liouville theory, we estimate the [math] approximation error for a spectral cutoff approximation of [math] functions. This yields a spectral cutoff regularization strategy for noisy data and an explicit stability estimate for contrast in [math] ([math]) in the full-aperture case. In the limited-aperture and multifrequency cases, we also obtain spectral cutoff regularization strategies for noisy data and stability estimates for a class of contrast.",

A path in [math] is called a [math]-path if its ends are distinct vertices in [math] and no internal vertices belong to [math]. In 1978, Mader showed a characterization of the maximum number of edge-disjoint [math]-paths. In this paper, we provide a combinatorial, deterministic algorithm for finding the maximum number of edge-disjoint [math]-paths. The algorithm adopts an augmenting path approach. More specifically, we utilize a new concept of short augmenting walks in auxiliary labeled graphs to capture a possible augmentation of the number of edge-disjoint [math]-paths. To design a search procedure for a short augmenting walk, we introduce blossoms analogously to the matching algorithm of Edmonds [Canad. J. Math., 17, 1965, pp. 449–467]. When the search procedure terminates without finding a short augmenting walk, the algorithm provides a certificate for the optimality of the current edge-disjoint [math]-paths. From this certificate, one can obtain the Edmonds–Gallai type decomposition introduced by Sebő and Szegő [Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization, LNCS 3064, Springer, Berlin, 2004, pp. 256–270]. The algorithm runs in [math] time, which is much faster than the best known deterministic algorithm based on a reduction to linear matroid parity. We also present a strongly polynomial algorithm for the maximum integer free multiflow problem, which asks for a nonnegative integer combination of [math]-paths maximizing the sum of the coefficients subject to capacity constraints on the edges.",
