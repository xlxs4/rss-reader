These schemes combine the symplectic Runge–Kutta method with the quadratic auxiliary variable approach. We first introduce an auxiliary variable that satisfies a quadratic equation to reformulate the original system into an equivalent one. This reformulated system possesses two strong quadratic invariants: energy and mass. Next, we discretize the reformulated system using symplectic Runge–Kutta methods, yielding a class of semi-discrete systems with arbitrarily high-order accuracy in time. The semi-discrete systems naturally preserve the discrete contour part of the strong invariants and the relationship of the quadratic equation. By eliminating the intermediate variable, we obtain the original energy conservation law. Then, the Fourier pseudo-spectral method is employed to obtain the fully discrete scheme that preserves the original energy and mass. We provide a fast solver to implement the proposed methods effectively. Numerical experiments demonstrate the expected accuracy and conservation of proposed schemes.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe shear shallow water model is an extension of the classical shallow water model to include the effects of vertical shear. It is a system of six non-linear hyperbolic PDE with non-conservative products. We develop a high-order entropy stable finite difference scheme for this model in one dimension and extend it to two dimensions on rectangular grids. The key idea is to rewrite the system so that non-conservative terms do not contribute to the entropy evolution. Then, we first develop an entropy conservative scheme for the conservative part, which is then extended to the complete system using the fact that the non-conservative terms do not contribute to the entropy production. The entropy dissipative scheme, which leads to an entropy inequality, is then obtained by carefully adding dissipative flux terms. The proposed schemes are then tested on several one and two-dimensional problems to demonstrate their stability and accuracy.",

          "description": "Abstract\nAn asymptotic preserving and energy stable scheme for the barotropic Euler system under the low Mach number scaling is designed and analysed. A velocity shift proportional to the pressure gradient is introduced in the convective fluxes, which leads to the dissipation of mechanical energy and the entropy stability at all Mach numbers. The resolution of the semi-implicit in time and upwind finite volume in space fully-discrete scheme involves two steps: the solution of an elliptic problem for the density and an explicit evaluation for the velocity. The proposed scheme possesses several physically relevant attributes, such as the positivity of density, the entropy stability and the consistency with the weak formulation of the continuous Euler system. The AP property of the scheme, i.e. the boundedness of the mesh parameters with respect to the Mach number and its consistency with the incompressible limit system, is shown rigorously. The results of extensive case studies are presented to substantiate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method.",

Transport coefficients, such as the mobility, thermal conductivity, and shear viscosity, are quantities of prime interest in statistical physics. At the macroscopic level, transport coefficients relate an external forcing of magnitude [math], with [math], acting on the system to an average response expressed through some steady-state flux. In practice, steady-state averages involved in the linear response are computed as time averages over a realization of some stochastic differential equation. Variance reduction techniques are of paramount interest in this context, as the linear response is scaled by a factor of [math], leading to large statistical error. One way to limit the increase in the variance is to allow for larger values of [math] by increasing the range of values of the forcing for which the nonlinear part of the response is sufficiently small. In theory, one can add an extra forcing to the physical perturbation of the system, called synthetic forcing, as long as this extra forcing preserves the invariant measure of the reference system. The aim is to find synthetic perturbations allowing one to reduce the nonlinear part of the response as much as possible. We present a mathematical framework for quantifying the quality of synthetic forcings, in the context of linear response theory, and discuss various possible choices for them. Our findings are illustrated with numerical results in low-dimensional systems.",

We present a computational method for studying transverse homoclinic orbits for periodic solutions of delay differential equations, a phenomenon that we refer to as the Poincaré scenario. The strategy is geometric in nature and consists of viewing the connection as the zero of a nonlinear map, such that the invertibility of its Fréchet derivative implies the transversality of the intersection. The map is defined by a projected boundary value problem (BVP), with boundary conditions in the (finite dimensional) unstable and (infinite dimensional) stable manifolds of the periodic orbit. The parameterization method is used to compute the unstable manifold, and the BVP is solved using a discrete time dynamical system approach (defined via the method of steps) and Chebyshev series expansions. We illustrate this technique by computing transverse homoclinic orbits in the cubic Ikeda and Mackey–Glass systems.",

The spectrum of the Koopman operator has been shown to encode many important statistical and geometric properties of a dynamical system. In this work, we consider induced linear operators acting on the space of sections of the state space’s tangent, cotangent, and tensor bundles. We first demonstrate how these operators are natural generalizations of Koopman operators acting on functions. We then draw connections between the various operators’ spectra and characterize the algebraic and differential topological properties of their spectra. We describe the discrete spectrum of these operators for linear dynamical systems and derive spectral expansions for linear vector fields. We define the notion of an “eigendistribution,” provide conditions for an eigendistribution to be integrable, and demonstrate how to recover the foliations arising from their integral manifolds. Last, we demonstrate that the characteristic Lyapunov exponents of a uniformly hyperbolic dynamical system are in the spectrum of the induced operators on sections of the tangent or cotangent bundle. We conclude with an application to differential geometry where the well-known fact that the flows of commuting vector fields commute is generalized, and we recover the original statement as a particular case of our result. We also apply our results to recover the Lyapunov exponents and the stable/unstable foliations of Arnold’s cat map via the spectrum of the induced operator on sections of the tangent bundle.",

For reaction networks arising in systems biology, the capacity for two or more steady states, that is, multistationarity, is an important property that underlies biochemical switches. Another property receiving much attention recently is absolute concentration robustness (ACR), which means that some species concentration is the same at all positive steady states. In this work, we investigate the prevalence of each property while paying close attention to when the properties occur together. Specifically, we consider a stochastic block framework for generating random networks and prove edge-probability thresholds at which, with high probability, multistationarity appears and ACR becomes rare. We also show that the small window in which both properties occur only appears in networks with many species. Taken together, our results confirm that, in random reversible networks, ACR and multistationarity together, or even ACR on its own, is highly atypical. Our proofs rely on two prior results, one pertaining to the prevalence of networks with deficiency zero and the other “lifting” multistationarity from small networks to larger ones.",

Experimental and theoretical studies have indicated that interactions of certain proteins lead to the cell polarization which plays a key role in controlling the cell movement. We study the cell polarity and movement based on a class of biophysical models that consist of reaction-diffusion equations for different proteins and the dynamics of a moving cell boundary. Such a moving boundary is often simulated by a phase-field model. We first apply the matched asymptotic analysis to give a rigorous derivation of the sharp-interface model of the cell boundary from a phase-field model. We then develop a robust numerical approach that combines the level-set method to track the sharp boundary of a moving cell and accurate discretization techniques for solving the reaction-diffusion equations on the moving cell region. Our extensive numerical simulations predict the cell polarization under various kinds of stimuli and capture both the linear and the circular trajectories of a moving cell for a long period of time. In particular, we have identified some key parameters controlling different cell trajectories that are less accurately predicted by reduced models. Our work has linked different models and also developed tools that can be adapted for the challenging three-dimensional simulations.",

Because of the significance of remediating contaminated ecosystems, many mathematical models have been developed to describe the interactions between populations and toxicants in polluted aquatic environments. These models typically neglect the consequences of toxicant-induced behavioral changes on population dynamics. Taking into account that individuals may flee from areas with high toxicant concentrations to areas with low toxicant concentrations in order to improve their chances of survival, growth, and reproduction, we develop a diffusive population-toxicant model with toxicant-taxis. We establish the global well-posedness of our model and prove the global stability of spatially homogeneous toxicant-only steady states and population-toxicant coexistence steady states under some conditions. We find conditions under which stable spatially inhomogeneous steady states become unstable to trigger spatial pattern formations as the toxicant-taxis is strong. We also identify a narrow parameter regime in which toxicant-only and population-toxicant coexistence steady states are bistable. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate that spatial aggregation and segregation patterns between the population and the toxicant will typically emerge. Our study highlights the important effects of toxicant-induced movement responses on the spatial distributions of populations in polluted aquatic environments.",

One of the most important branches of nonlinear control theory of dynamical systems is the so-called sliding mode. Its aim is the design of a (nonlinear) feedback law that brings and maintains the state trajectory of a dynamic system on a given sliding surface. Here, dynamics become completely independent of the model parameters and can be tuned accordingly to the desired target. In this paper we study this problem when the feedback law is subject to strong structural constraints. In particular, we assume that the control input may take values only over two bounded and disjoint sets. Such sets could be also not perfectly known a priori. An example is a control input allowed to switch only between two values. Under these peculiarities, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee sliding-mode control effectiveness for a class of time-varying continuous-time linear systems that includes all the stationary state-space linear models. Our analysis covers several scientific fields. It is only apparently confined to the linear setting and also allows one study an important set of nonlinear models. We describe fundamental examples related to epidemiology where the control input is the level of contact rate among people and the sliding surface permits to control the number of infected. We prove the global convergence of epidemic sliding-mode control schemes applied to two popular dynamical systems used in epidemiology, i.e., SEIR and SAIR, and based on the introduction of severe restrictions like lockdowns. Results obtained in the literature regarding control of many other epidemiological models are also generalized by casting them within a general sliding-mode theory.",

The existence of HIV post-treatment controllers (PTCs) offers hope for an HIV functional cure, and understanding the critical mechanisms determining PTC represents a key step toward this goal. Here, we have studied these mechanisms by analyzing an established mathematical model for HIV viral dynamics. In mathematical models, critical mechanisms are represented by parameters that affect the tipping points to induce qualitatively different dynamics, and in cases with multiple stability, the initial conditions of the system also play a role in determining the fate of the solution. As such, for the tipping points in parameter space, we developed and implemented a sensitivity analysis of the threshold conditions of the associated bifurcations to identify the critical mechanisms for this model. Our results suggest that the infected cell death rate and the saturation parameter for cytotoxic T lymphocyte proliferation significantly affect post-treatment control. For the case with multiple stability, in state space of initial conditions, we first investigated the saddle-type equilibrium point to identify its stable manifold, which delimits trapping regions associated to the high and low viral set points. The identified stable manifold serves as a guide for the loads of immune cells and HIV virus at the time of therapy termination to achieve post-treatment control.",

The study of emergent behavior of swarms is of great interest for applied sciences. One of the most fundamental questions for self-organizing swarms is whether the swarms disperse or remain in a spatially cohesive configuration. In this paper we study dissipativity properties and spatial cohesiveness of the swarm of self-propelled particles governed by the model [math], where [math], [math], and [math] is a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix. The self-propulsion term is assumed to be continuously differentiable and to grow faster than [math], that is, [math] as [math]. We establish that the velocity and acceleration of the particles are ultimately bounded. We show that when [math] is trivial, the positions of the particles are also ultimately bounded. For systems with [math], we show that, while the system might infinitely drift away from its initial location, the particles remain within a bounded distance from the generalized center of mass of the system, which geometrically coincides with the weighted average of agent positions. The weights are determined by the coefficients of the projection matrix onto [math]. We also discuss the ultimate boundedness for systems with bounded coupling, including the Morse potential systems, and systems governed by power-law potentials with strong repulsion properties. We show that the former systems are ultimately bounded in the velocity-acceleration domain, whereas the models based on the power-law potentials are not.",

The circadian clock is an internal timer that coordinates the daily rhythms of behavior and physiology, including sleep and hormone secretion. Accurately tracking the state of the circadian clock, or circadian phase, holds immense potential for precision medicine. Wearable devices present an opportunity to estimate the circadian phase in the real world, as they can noninvasively monitor various physiological outputs influenced by the circadian clock. However, accurately estimating circadian phase from wearable data remains challenging, primarily due to the lack of methods that integrate minute-by-minute wearable data with prior knowledge of the circadian phase. To address this issue, we propose a framework that integrates multitime scale physiological data and estimates the circadian phase, along with an efficient implementation algorithm based on Bayesian inference and a new state space estimation method called the level set Kalman filter. Our numerical experiments indicate that our approach outperforms previous methods for circadian phase estimation consistently. Furthermore, our method enables us to examine the contribution of noise from different sources to the estimation, which was not feasible with prior methods. We found that internal noise unrelated to external stimuli is a crucial factor in determining estimation results. Last, we developed a user-friendly computational package and applied it to real-world data to demonstrate the potential value of our approach. Our results provide a foundation for systematically understanding the real-world dynamics of the circadian clock.",

While LCS admits a quadratic time solution, recent evidence suggests that solving the problem may be impossible in truly subquadratic time. A special case of LCS wherein each character appears at most once in every string is equivalent to the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem which can be solved in quasilinear time. In this work, we present novel algorithms for approximating LCS in truly subquadratic time and LIS in truly sublinear time. Our approximation factors depend on the ratio of the optimal solution size to the input size. We denote this ratio by [math] and obtain the following results for LCS and LIS without any prior knowledge of [math]: a truly subquadratic time algorithm for LCS with approximation factor [math] and a truly sublinear time algorithm for LIS with approximation factor [math].

The (unweighted) tree edit distance problem for [math] node trees asks to compute a measure of dissimilarity between two rooted trees with node labels. The current best algorithm from more than a decade ago runs in [math] time [Demaine et al., Automata, Languages and Programming, Springer, Berlin, 2007, pp. 146–157]. The same paper also showed that [math] is the best possible running time for any algorithm using the so-called decomposition strategy, which underlies almost all the known algorithms for this problem. These algorithms would also work for the weighted tree edit distance problem, which cannot be solved in truly subcubic time under the All-Pairs Shortest Paths conjecture [Bringmann et al., ACM Trans. Algorithms, 16 (2020), pp. 48:1–48:22]. In this paper, we break the cubic barrier by showing an [math] time algorithm for the unweighted tree edit distance problem. We consider an equivalent maximization problem and use a dynamic programming scheme involving matrices with many special properties. By using a decomposition scheme as well as several combinatorial techniques, we reduce tree edit distance to the max-plus product of bounded-difference matrices, which can be solved in truly subcubic time [Bringmann et al., Proceedings of the IEEE 57th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2016, pp. 375–384].",
