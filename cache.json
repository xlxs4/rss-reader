          "description": "Abstract\nThis work provides an inexact primal-dual algorithm for a large class of optimal transport problems. It is based on the implicit Euler discretization of a proper dynamical system for linearly constrained convex optimization problems, and by using the tool of Lyapunov function, the global (super-)linear convergence rate is established for the objective residual and feasibility violation. The presented method contains an inner problem that possesses a strong semismoothness property, which motivates the use of the semismooth Newton iteration. In addition, by exploring the hidden structure of the problem itself, the linear equation arising from the Newton step is transferred equivalently into a graph Laplacian system, for which a robust algebraic multigrid method is proposed and analyzed via the famous Xu–Zikatanov identity. Finally, numerical tests are provided to validate the efficiency of our method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe present a finite element discretization scheme for multidimensional fractional diffusion problems with spatially varying diffusivity and fractional order. We consider the symmetric integral form of these nonlocal equations defined on general geometries and in arbitrary bounded domains. A number of challenges are encountered when discretizing these equations. The first comes from the heterogeneous kernel singularity in the fractional integral operator. The second comes from the formally dense discrete operator with its quadratic growth in memory footprint and arithmetic operations. An additional challenge comes from the need to handle volume conditions—the generalization of classical local boundary conditions to the nonlocal setting. Satisfying these conditions requires that the…",

          "description": "Abstract\nSimplicial complexes are generalizations of classical graphs. Their homology groups are widely used to characterize the structure and the topology of data in e.g. chemistry, neuroscience, and transportation networks. In this work we assume we are given a simplicial complex and that we can act on its underlying graph, formed by the set of 1-simplices, and we investigate the stability of its homology with respect to perturbations of the edges in such graph. Precisely, exploiting the isomorphism between the homology groups and the higher-order Laplacian operators, we propose a numerical method to compute the smallest graph perturbation sufficient to change the dimension of the simplex’s Hodge homology. Our approach is based on a matrix nearness problem formulated as a matrix differential equation, which requires an appropriate weighting and normalizing procedure for the boundary operators acting on the Hodge algebra’s homology groups. We develop a bilevel optimization procedure suitable for the formulated matrix nearness problem and illustrate the method’s performance on a variety of synthetic quasi-triangulation datasets and real-world transportation networks.",

In this paper, relying on its nonsmooth dual problem and active set techniques, we first propose a Duality-Gap-Active-Set strategy (DGASS) to effectively identify the indices of zero-elements and the signs of nonzero entries of the optimal solution. Serving as an efficient acceleration strategy, DGASS can be embedded into certain iterative methods. In particular, by applying DGASS to both the proximal gradient algorithm (PGA) and the proximal semismooth Newton algorithm (PSNA), we propose the method of PGA-DGASS and PSNA-DGASS, respectively. Global convergence and local quadratic convergence rate are discussed. We report on numerical results over both synthetic and real data sets to demonstrate the high efficiency of the two DGASS-accelerated methods.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe propose two spatial second-order schemes for linear radiative transfer equations by using the idea of the unified gas kinetic scheme (UGKS) to construct the numerical boundary fluxes, and show that the proposed schemes are both positive and asymptotic preserving. The UGKS was proposed by Xu and Huang (J Comput Phys 229:7747–7764, 2010) for continuum and rarefied flows firstly, and was then applied to a linear radiative transfer equation by Mieussens in (J Comput Phys 253:138–156, 2013) where the asymptotic preserving property of UGKS is shown. Although it is asymptotic preserving, UGKS can not always keep the positivity of solutions. We first apply UGKS to discretize a linear radiative transfer equation to have a spatial second-order scheme. Then, by a detailed analysis of the numerical boundary fluxes, we are able to find the reasons why the positive preserving property of UGKS fails. Finally, we carefully employ a linear scaling limiter and a flux correction to make UGKS positive-preserving but still asymptotic-preserving. Consequently, we propose two spatial second-order positive and asymptotic preserving unified gas kinetic schemes for the linear radiative transfer equation, thus improving the earlier work (J Comput Phys 444:110546, 2021) where only a first-order positive and asymptotic scheme is developed. The proposed schemes can well capture the solution of the diffusion limit equation in optically thick regions without requiring the cell size being smaller than the photon’s mean free path, while the solution in optically thin regions can also be well resolved in a natural way. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that a spatial second-order positive and asymptotic preserving gas kinetic scheme for linear radiative transfer equations is constructed. Several numerical experiments are included to validate the spatial second-order accuracy, positive- and asymptotic-preserving properties of the proposed schemes.",

          "description": "Abstract\nLinear inverse problems arise in diverse engineering fields especially in signal and image reconstruction. The development of computational methods for linear inverse problems with sparsity is one of the recent trends in this field. The so-called optimal k-thresholding is a newly introduced method for sparse optimization and linear inverse problems. Compared to other sparsity-aware algorithms, the advantage of optimal k-thresholding method lies in that it performs thresholding and error metric reduction simultaneously and thus works stably and robustly for solving medium-sized linear inverse problems. However, the runtime of this method is generally high when the size of the problem is large. The purpose of this paper is to propose an acceleration strategy for this method. Specifically, we propose a heavy-ball-based optimal k-thresholding algorithm and its relaxed variants for sparse linear inverse problems. The convergence of these algorithms is shown under the restricted isometry property. In addition, the numerical performance of the heavy-ball-based relaxed optimal k-thresholding pursuit (HBROTP) has been evaluated, and simulations indicate that HBROTP admits robustness for signal and image reconstruction even in noisy environments.",

Most existing methods for RTC utilize the tensor nuclear norm (TNN) to evaluate the tensor rank. However, the TNN often yields biased solutions due to its loose approximation for the tensor rank. To solve this problem, we derive a unified non-convex surrogate that better approximates the tensor rank. Our surrogate is composed of several non-convex penalty functions. Further, we propose a generalized non-convex model, which minimizes a weighted combination of the unified non-convex surrogate and the \n                      \n                      \\(\\ell _1\\)\n                      \n                    -norm data fidelity term.

Dirac cones are conical singularities that occur near the degenerate points in band structures. Such singularities result in enormous unusual phenomena of the corresponding physical systems. This work investigates double Dirac cones that occur in the vicinity of a fourfold degenerate point in the band structures of certain operators. It is known that such degeneracy originates in the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We use two-dimensional periodic Schrödinger operators with novel designed symmetries as our prototype. First, we characterize admissible potentials, termed super honeycomb lattice potentials. They are honeycomb lattices potentials with a key additional translation symmetry. It is rigorously justified that Schrödinger operators with such potentials almost guarantee the existence of double Dirac cones on the bands at the [math] point, the origin of the Brillouin zone. We further show that the additional translation symmetry is an indispensable ingredient by a perturbation analysis. Indeed, the double cones disappear if the additional translation symmetry is broken. Many numerical simulations are provided which agree well with our analysis.",

Twisted bilayer graphene gives rise to large moiré patterns that form a triangular network upon mechanical relaxation. If gating is included, each triangular region has gapped electronic Dirac points that behave as bulk topological insulators with topological indices depending on valley index and the type of stacking. Since each triangle has two oppositely charged valleys, they remain topologically trivial. In this work, we address several questions related to the edge currents of this system by analysis and computation of continuum PDE models. First, we derive the bulk invariants corresponding to a single valley, and then apply a bulk-interface correspondence to quantify asymmetric transport along the interface. Second, we introduce a valley-coupled continuum model to show how valleys are approximately decoupled in the presence of small perturbations using a multiscale expansion, and how valleys couple for larger defects. Third, we present a method to prove for a large class of continuum (pseudo)differential models that a quantized asymmetric current is preserved through a junction such as a triangular network vertex. We support all of these arguments with numerical simulations using spectral methods to compute relevant currents and wave packet propagation.",

Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) and force fields (i.e., interaction laws for atoms and molecules) are typically trained on limited data-sets that cover only a very small section of the full space of possible input structures. MLIPs are nevertheless capable of making accurate predictions of forces and energies in simulations involving (seemingly) much more complex structures. In this article we propose a framework within which this kind of generalization can be rigorously understood. As a prototypical example, we apply the framework to the case of simulating point defects in a crystalline solid. Here, we demonstrate how the accuracy of the simulation depends explicitly on the size of the training structures, on the kind of observations (e.g., energies, forces, force constants, virials) to which the model has been fitted, and on the fit accuracy. The new theoretical insights we gain partially justify current best practices in the MLIP literature and in addition suggest a new approach to the collection of training data and the design of loss functions.",

This work presents a mathematical theory for electromagnetic scattering resonances in a subwavelength annular hole embedded in a metallic slab, with the annulus width [math]. The model is representative among many 3D subwavelength hole structures, which are able to induce resonant scattering of electromagnetic wave and the so-called extraordinary optical transmission. We develop a multiscale framework for the underlying scattering problem based upon a combination of the integral equation in the exterior domain and the waveguide mode expansion inside the tiny hole. The matching of the electromagnetic field over the hole aperture leads to a sequence of decoupled infinite systems, which are used to set up the resonance conditions for the scattering problem. By performing rigorous analysis for the infinite systems and the resonance conditions, we characterize all the resonances in a bounded domain over the complex plane. It is shown that the resonances are associated with the transverse electric (TE) and transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waveguide modes in the annular hole, and they are close to the real axis with the imaginary parts of order [math]. We also investigate resonant scattering when an incident wave is present. It is proved that the electromagnetic field is amplified with order [math] at the resonant frequencies that are associated with the TE modes in the annular hole. On the other hand, one particular resonance associated with the TEM mode cannot be excited by a plane wave but can be excited with a near-field electric dipole source, leading to field enhancement of order [math].",

Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has recently become a popular tool for the nonintrusive analysis of dynamical systems. Exploiting proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) as a dimensionality reduction technique, DMD is able to approximate a dynamical system as a sum of spatial bases evolving linearly in time, thus enabling a better understanding of the physical phenomena and forecasting of future time instants. In this work we propose an extension of DMD to parameterized dynamical systems, focusing on the future forecasting of the output of interest in a parametric context. Initially all the snapshots—for different parameters and different time instants—are projected to a reduced space; then DMD, or one of its variants, is employed to approximate reduced snapshots for future time instants. Exploiting the low dimension of the reduced space, we then combine the predicted reduced snapshots using regression techniques, thus enabling the possibility of approximating any untested parametric configuration in the future. This paper depicts in detail the algorithmic core of this method; we also present and discuss three test cases for our algorithm: a simple dynamical system with a linear parameter dependency, a heat problem with nonlinear parameter dependency, and a fluid dynamics problem with nonlinear parameter dependency.",

For reaction networks with zero-one stoichiometric coefficients (or simply zero-one networks), we prove that if a network admits a Hopf bifurcation, then the rank of the stoichiometric matrix is at least four. As a corollary, we show that if a zero-one network admits a Hopf bifurcation, then it contains at least four species and five reactions. As applications, we show that there exist rank-four subnetworks, which have the capacity for Hopf bifurcations/oscillations, in two biologically significant networks: the mitogen-activated-protein-kinase cascade and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase network.

The extinction of species is a major problem of concern with a large literature. We investigate a differential equations model for population interactions with the goal of determining when several species (i.e., coordinates of a bounded solution) must die out or “go extinct” and must do so exponentially fast. Typically each coordinate represents the population density of a different species. For our main tool, we create what we call “die-out” Lyapunov functions. A given system may have several or many such functions, each of which is a function of a different set of coordinates. That die-out function implies that one of the species in its subset must die out exponentially fast—for almost every choice of coefficients of the system. We create a “team” of die-out functions that work together to show that [math] species must die, where [math] is determined separately. Second, we present a “trophic” condition for generalized Lotka–Volterra systems that guarantees that there is a trapping region that is globally attracting. That implies that all solutions are bounded.",

Reaction-diffusion models with nonlocal constraints naturally arise as limiting cases of coupled bulk-surface models of intracellular signalling. In this paper, a minimal, mass-conserving model of cell-polarization on a curved membrane is analyzed in the limit of slow surface diffusion. Using the tools of formal asymptotics and calculus of variations, we study the characteristic wave-pinning behavior of this system on three dynamical timescales. On the short timescale, generation of an interface separating high- and low-concentration domains is established under suitable conditions. Intermediate timescale dynamics are shown to lead to a uniform growth or shrinking of these domains to sizes that are fixed by global parameters. Finally, the long timescale dynamics reduce to area-preserving geodesic curvature flow that may lead to multi-interface steady state solutions. These results provide a foundation for studying cell polarization and related phenomena in biologically relevant geometries.",

This manuscript is aimed at addressing several long-standing limitations of dynamic mode decomposition in the application of Koopman analysis. Principal among these limitations are the convergence of associated dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) algorithms and the existence of Koopman modes. To address these limitations, two major modifications are made, where Koopman operators are removed from the analysis in light of Liouville operators (known as Koopman generators in special cases), and these operators are shown to be compact for certain pairs of Hilbert spaces selected separately as the domain and range of the operator. While eigenfunctions are discarded in the general analysis, a viable reconstruction algorithm is still demonstrated, and the sacrifice of eigenfunctions realizes the theoretical goals of DMD analysis that have yet to be achieved in other contexts. However, in the case where the domain is embedded in the range, an eigenfunction approach is still achievable, where a more typical DMD routine is established, but that leverages a finite rank representation that converges in norm. The manuscript concludes with the description of two DMD algorithms that converge when a dense collection of occupation kernels, arising from the data, are leveraged in the analysis.",

This work studies front formation in the Allen–Cahn equation with a parameter heterogeneity which slowly varies in space. In particular, we consider a heterogeneity which mediates the local stability of the zero state and subsequent pitchfork bifurcation to a nontrivial state. For slowly varying ramps which are either rigidly propagating in time or stationary, we rigorously establish existence and stability of positive, monotone fronts and give leading order expansions for their interface location. For nonzero ramp speeds, and sufficiently small ramp slopes, the front location is determined by the local transition between convective and absolute instability of the base state and leads to an [math] delay beyond the instantaneous pitchfork location before the system jumps to a nontrivial state. The slow ramp induces a further delay of the interface controlled by a slow passage through a fold of strong- and weak-stable eigenspaces of the associated linearization. We introduce projective coordinates to desingularize the dynamics near the trivial state and track relevant invariant manifolds all the way to the fold point. We then use geometric singular perturbation theory and blow-up techniques to locate the desired intersection of invariant manifolds. For stationary ramps, the front is governed by the slow passage through the instantaneous pitchfork bifurcation with inner expansion given by the unique Hastings–McLeod connecting solution of Painlevé’s second equation. We once again use geometric singular perturbation theory and blow-up techniques to track invariant manifolds into a neighborhood of the nonhyperbolic point where the ramp passes through zero and to locate intersections.",

In this work we propose a model that represents the relation between fish ponds, the mosquito population and the transmission of malaria. It has been observed that in the Amazonic region of Acre, in the North of Brazil, fish farming is correlated to the transmission of malaria when carried out in artificial ponds that become breeding sites. Evidence has been found indicating that cleaning the vegetation from the edges of the crop tanks helps to control the size of the mosquito population. We use our model to determine the effective contribution of fish farming practices on malaria transmission dynamics. The model consists of a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations with jumps at the cleaning time, which act as impulsive controls. We study the asymptotic behavior of the system in function of the intensity and periodicity of the cleaning, and the value of the parameters. In particular, we state sufficient conditions under which the mosquito population is eliminated or persists, and under which the malaria is eliminated or becomes endemic.

We formulate an effective numerical scheme that can readily, and accurately, calculate the dynamics of weakly interacting multi-pulse solutions of the quintic complex Ginzburg–Landau equation (QCGLE) in one space dimension. The scheme is based on a global center-manifold reduction where one considers the solution of the QCGLE as the composition of individual pulses plus a remainder function, which is orthogonal to the adjoint eigenfunctions of the linearized operator about a single pulse. This center-manifold projection overcomes the difficulties of other, more orthodox, numerical schemes, by yielding a fast-slow system describing “slow” ordinary differential equations for the locations and phases of the individual pulses, and a “fast” partial differential equation for the remainder function. With small parameter [math] where [math] is a constant and [math] is the minimal pulse separation distance, we write the fast-slow system in terms of first-order and second-order correction terms only, a formulation which is solved more efficiently than the full system. This fast-slow system is integrated numerically using adaptive time-stepping. Results are presented here for two- and three-pulse interactions. For the two-pulse problem, cells of periodic behavior, separated by an infinite set of heteroclinic orbits, are shown to “split” under perturbation creating complex spiral behavior. For the case of three-pulse interaction a range of dynamics, including chaotic pulse interaction, is found. While results are presented for pulse interaction in the QCGLE, the numerical scheme can also be applied to a wider class of parabolic PDEs.",

It is shown that the discrete semigroup has a numerical attractor, which converges upper semicontinuously to the global attractor as the step size tends to zero.

The task of modeling and forecasting a dynamical system is one of the oldest problems, and it remains challenging. Broadly, this task has two subtasks: extracting the full dynamical information from a partial observation, and then explicitly learning the dynamics from this information. We present a mathematical framework in which the dynamical information is represented in the form of an embedding. The framework combines the two subtasks using the language of spaces, maps, and commutations. The framework also unifies two of the most common learning paradigms: delay-coordinates and reservoir computing. We use this framework as a platform for two other investigations of the reconstructed system, its dynamical stability and the growth of error under iterations. We show that these questions are deeply tied to more fundamental properties of the underlying system, i.e., the behavior of matrix cocycles over the base dynamics, its nonuniform hyperbolic behavior, and its decay of correlations. Thus, our framework bridges the gap between universally observed behavior of dynamics modeling and the spectral, differential, and ergodic properties intrinsic to the dynamics.",

The stability analysis of synchronization in time-varying higher-order networked structures (simplicial complexes) is a challenging problem due to the presence of time-varying group interactions. In this context, most of the previous studies have been done either on temporal pairwise networks or on static simplicial complexes. Here, for the first time, we propose a general framework to study the synchronization phenomenon in temporal simplicial complexes. We show that the synchronous state exists as an invariant solution and obtain the necessary condition for it to emerge as a stable state in the fast-switching regime. We prove that the time-averaged simplicial complex plays the role of synchronization indicator whenever the switching among simplicial topologies is adequately fast. We attempt to transform the stability problem into a master stability function form. Unfortunately, for the general circumstances, the dimension reduction of the master stability equation is cumbersome due to the presence of group interactions. However, we overcome this difficulty in two interesting situations based on either the functional forms of the coupling schemes or the connectivity structure of the simplicial complex, and we demonstrate that the necessary condition mimics the form of a master stability function in these cases. We verify our analytical findings by applying them on synthetic and real-world networked systems. We find that the presence of temporality along with the multiway interactions improves the synchronization phenomena as compared to the static higher-ordered or temporal pairwise system. In addition, our results also reveal that with sufficient higher-order coupling and adequately fast rewiring, the temporal simplicial complex achieves synchrony even in a very low connectivity regime.",

In a “structured system” of equations, each equation depends on a specified subset of the variables. In this article, we explore properties common to “almost every” system with a fixed structure and how the properties can be read from the corresponding connection graph. A solution [math] of a system [math] is called robust if it persists despite small changes in [math]. We establish methods for determining robustness that depends on the structure, as expressed in the properties of the corresponding directed graph of the structured system. The keys to understanding linear and nonlinear structured systems are subsets of variables that we call forward and backward bottlenecks. In particular, when robustness fails in a structured system, it is due to the existence of a unique “backward bottleneck” that we call a “minimax bottleneck.” We present a numerical method for locating the minimax bottleneck. We show how to remove it by adding edges to the graph.",

This work considers the propagation of high-frequency waves in highly scattering media where physical absorption of a nonlinear nature occurs. Using the classical tools of the Wigner transform and multiscale analysis, we derive semilinear radiative transport models for the phase-space intensity and the diffusive limits of such transport models. As an application, we consider an inverse problem for the semilinear transport equation, where we reconstruct the absorption coefficients of the equation from a functional of its solution. We obtain a uniqueness result on the inverse problem.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. Accurate estimation of the transmissibility of an infectious disease is critical to understanding disease transmission dynamics and designing effective control strategies. However, it has always been difficult to estimate the transmission rates due to the unobservability and multiple contributing factors. In this paper, we develop a data-driven inverse method based on discretizations of compartmental differential equation models for estimating time-varying transmission rates of infectious diseases. By developing iteration algorithms for three typical classes of infectious diseases, namely, a disease with seasonal cycles, a disease with nonseasonal cycles, and a disease with no obvious periodicity, we demonstrate that the discrete inverse method is a valuable tool for extracting information from available pandemic or epidemic incidence data. We also obtain insights for some epidemiological phenomena and issues of concern based on each application. Our method is highly intuitive and generates rapid implementation even with multiple years of data instances. In particular, it can be used in conjunction with other data-driven technologies, such as machine learning, to forecast future disease dynamics based on future weather conditions, policy decisions, or human mobility trends, providing guidance to public health authorities.",

This paper proposes a new mathematical formulation for flow measurement based on the inverse source problem for wave equations with partial boundary measurement. Inspired by the design of acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), we formulate an inverse source problem that can recover the flow field from the observation data on boundary receivers. To our knowledge, this is the first mathematical model of flow measurement using partial differential equations. This model is proved well-posed, and the corresponding algorithm is derived to compute the velocity field efficiently. Extensive numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our model. The comparison results demonstrate that our model is ten times more accurate than ADCP. Our formulation is capable of simulating a variety of practical measurement scenarios.",

Modern applications of graph algorithms often involve the use of the output sets (usually, a subset of edges or vertices of the input graph) as inputs to other algorithms. Since the input graphs of interest are large and dynamic, it is desirable for an algorithm’s output to not change drastically when a few random edges are removed from the input graph, so as to prevent issues in postprocessing. Alternately, having such a guarantee also means that one can revise the solution obtained by running the algorithm on the original graph in just a few places in order to obtain a solution for the new graph. We formalize this feature by introducing the notion of average sensitivity of graph algorithms, which is t…",

We study the complexity of local graph-centrality estimation, with the goal of approximating the centrality score of a given target node while exploring only a sublinear number of nodes/arcs of the graph and performing a sublinear number of elementary operations. We develop a technique, which we apply to PageRank and Heat Kernel, for constructing a low-variance score estimator through a local exploration of the graph. We obtain an algorithm that, given any node in any graph of [math] nodes and [math] arcs, with probability [math] computes a multiplicative [math]-approximation of its score by examining only [math] nodes/arcs, where [math] is the maximum outdegree of the graph and [math] and [math] factors are omitted for readability. A similar bound holds for computational cost. We also prove a lower bound of [math] for both query complexity and computational complexity. Moreover, in the jump-and-crawl graph-access model, our technique yields a [math]-queries algorithm; we show that this algorithm is optimal up to a logarithmic factor—in fact, sublogarithmic in the case of PageRank. These are the first algorithms with sublinear worst-case bounds for general directed graphs and any choice of the target node.",
