          "description": "Yeast SCRaMbLE is an experimental method using designed synthetic yeast chromosomes to generate combinatorial diversity through genome rearrangements. These events occur at designed loxPsym recombination sites through the activity of Cre recombinase. While the synthetic SCRaMbLE system was designed to explore minimal genomes and permit rapid genome evolution, the pattern of recombinations also reflects inherent properties of DNA looping required to coalesce pairs of loxPsym sites.\n\nGenomes of yeast strains generated by SCRaMbLE are analyzed here using a new statistical mechanics model, called the SCRaMbLE Polymer Interaction (SPI) model. SPI uses polymer physics to model recombinations, and implements efficient rejection sampling and histogram reweighting algorithms to conduct SCRaMbLE experiments in silico.\n\nUsing SPI, we found that recombination events observed experimentally are consistent with a random walk scaling exponent ranging between 0.45 and 0.6, which spans values of 0.5 for a Gaussian polymer and 0.588 for a self-avoiding walk. SPI provides a highly accurate tool to study SCRaMbLE recombinations and massively parallel genome recombination experiments.",

          "description": "Sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) has been utilized as a food, medicine, and spiritual symbol for nearly 3,000 years. The medicinal properties of lotus are largely attributed to its unique profile of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs), which includes potential anti-cancer, anti-malarial and anti-arrhythmic compounds. BIA biosynthesis in sacred lotus differs markedly from that of opium poppy and other members of the Ranunculales, most notably in an abundance of BIAs possessing the (R)-stereochemical configuration and the absence of reticuline, a major branchpoint intermediate in most BIA producers. Owing to these unique metabolic features and the pharmacological potential of lotus, we set out to elucidate the BIA biosynthesis network in N. nucifera. Here we show that lotus CYP80G (NnCYP80G) …",

          "description": "Recombinant expression of proteins destined to form biological materials often results in poor production yields or loss of their function due to premature aggregation. Recently, liquid-liquid phase separation has been proposed as a mechanism to control protein solubility during expression and accumulation in the cytoplasm. Here, we investigate this process in vivo during the recombinant overexpression of the spider silk-mimetic mini-spidroin NT2RepCT in Escherichia coli. The protein forms intracellular liquid-like condensates that shift to a solid-like state triggered by a decrease in their microenvironmental pH. These features are also maintained in the purified sample in vitro both in the presence of a molecular crowding agent mimicking the bacterial intracellular environment, and during a biomimetic extrusion process leading to fiber formation. Overall, we demonstrate that characterization of protein condensates inside E. coli could be used as a basis for selecting proteins for both materials applications and their fundamental structure-function studies.",

          "description": "In genome engineering, integration of incoming DNA has been dependent on enzymes produced by dividing cells which has been a bottle neck towards increasing DNA-insertion frequencies and accuracy. RNA-guided transposition with CRISPR-associated transposase (CAST) was shown to be highly effective and specific in Escherichia coli. Here we developed Golden-Gate vectors to test this approach in filamentous cyanobacteria and show that CAST is effective in Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120. The comparatively large plasmids containing the CAST and the engineered transposon were successfully transferred into Anabaena via conjugation using either suicide or replicative plasmids. Single guide RNA that target the leading, but not the reverse complement strand were effective with the protospacer associated motif (PAM) sequence included in the single guide RNA. In four out of six cases analyzed over two distinct target loci, the insertion site was exactly 63 bases after the PAM. CAST on a replicating plasmid slowed bacterial growth which could be used to cure the plasmid. In all six cases analyzed, only the transposon defined by the sequence ranging from left and right elements was inserted at the target loci, therefore, RNA-guided transposition resulted from cut and paste. No endogenous transposons were remobilized by exposure to CAST enzymes. This work is foundational for genome editing by RNA-guided transposition in filamentous cyanobacteria, whether in culture or in complex communities.",

          "description": "There are many open questions about the mechanisms that coordinate the dynamic, multicellular behaviors required for organogenesis. Synthetic circuits that can record in vivo signaling networks have been critical in elucidating animal development. Here, we report on the transfer of this technology to plants using orthogonal serine integrases to mediate site-specific and irreversible DNA recombination visualized by switching between fluorescent reporters. When combined with promoters expressed during lateral root initiation, integrases amplified reporter signal and permanently marked all descendants. In addition, we have developed a suite of methods to tune the threshold for integrase switching, including: RNA/protein degradation tags, a nuclear localization signal, and a split-intein system. These tools improved the robustness of integrase-mediated switching with different promoters and the stability of switching behavior over multiple generations. This integrase toolbox can be used to build history-dependent circuits to decode the order of expression during organogenesis in many contexts.",

          "description": "Yeast SCRaMbLE is an experimental method using designed synthetic yeast chromosomes to generate combinatorial diversity through genome rearrangements. These events occur at designed loxPsym recombination sites through the activity of Cre recombinase. While the synthetic SCRaMbLE system was designed to explore minimal genomes and permit rapid genome evolution, the pattern of recombinations also reflects inherent properties of DNA looping required to coalesce pairs of loxPsym sites.\n\nGenomes of yeast strains generated by SCRaMbLE are analyzed here using a new statistical mechanics model, called the SCRaMbLE Polymer Interaction (SPI) model. SPI uses polymer physics to model recombinations, and implements efficient rejection sampling and histogram reweighting algorithms to conduct SCRaMbLE experiments in silico.\n\nUsing SPI, we found that recombination events observed experimentally are consistent with a random walk scaling exponent ranging between 0.45 and 0.6, which spans values of 0.55 for a Gaussian polymer and 0.588 for a self-avoiding walk. SPI provides a highly accurate tool to study SCRaMbLE recombinations and massively parallel genome recombination experiments.",

          "description": "Bacterial genome editing commonly relies on chromosomal cleavage with Cas nucleases to counter-select against unedited cells. However, editing normally requires efficient recombination and high transformation efficiencies, which are unavailable in most strains. Here, we show that systematically attenuating DNA targeting activity enables RecA-mediated repair in different bacteria, allowing chromosomal cleavage to drive genome editing. Attenuation can be achieved by altering the format or expression strength of guide (g)RNAs; using nucleases with reduced cleavage activity; or engineering attenuated gRNAs (atgRNAs) with disruptive hairpins, perturbed nuclease scaffolds, non-canonical PAMs, or guide mismatches. These modifications greatly increase cell counts and even improve the efficiency of different types of edits for Cas9 and Cas12a in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella oxytoca. We further applied atgRNAs to restore ampicillin sensitivity in Klebsiella pneumoniae, establishing a new resistance marker for genetic studies. Attenuating DNA targeting thus offers a counterintuitive means to achieve CRISPR-driven editing across bacteria.",

Here, we evaluated the effects of age and MCI on the ability to accurately modulate spatial (i.e., joint kinematics), temporal (i.e., step timing), and spatiotemporal features of gait to achieve spatial and temporal targets during walking. We developed novel rhythmic movement sequences - nine spatial, nine temporal, and four spatiotemporal - that deviated from typical spatial and temporal features of walking. Healthy young adults (HYA), healthy older adults (HOA), and adults with MCI were trained on each gait modification before performing the modification overground, with kinematic data recorded using wearable sensors. HOA performed spatial (p = 0.010) and spatiotemporal (p = 0.048) gait modifications less accurately than HYA. Individuals with MCI performed spatiotemporal gait modifications less accurately than HOA (p = 0.017). Spatial modifications to the swing phase of gait (p = 0.006, Cohens d = -1.3), and two- and four-step Duple rhythms during temporal modifications (p  0.9) elicited the largest differences in gait performance in HYA vs. HOA and HOA vs. MCI, respectively. These findings suggest that age-related declines in strength and balance reduce the ability to accurately modulate spatial gait features, while declines in working memory in individuals with MCI may reduce the ability to perform longer temporal gait modification sequences. Differences in performance on rhythmic movement sequences highlight the impacts of motor and cognitive deficits on gait modulation capacity, which may assist therapists in personalizing therapies based on these deficits and provide more sensitive indices to track intervention efficacy.",

          "description": "Lactobacilli are gram-positive bacteria that are growing in importance for the healthcare industry and genetically engineering them as living therapeutics is highly sought after. However, progress in this field is hindered since most strains are difficult to genetically manipulate, partly due since their complex and thick cell walls limit our capability to transform them with exogenous DNA. To overcome this, large amounts of DNA (>1 g) are normally required to successfully transform these bacteria. An intermediate host, like E. coli, is often used to amplify recombinant DNA to such amounts although this approach poses unwanted drawbacks such as increase in plasmid size, different methylation patterns and limitation of introducing only genes compatible with the intermediate host. In this work, we have developed a direct cloning method based on Gibson assembly and PCR to amplify the DNA to sufficient quantities for successful transformation in L. plantarum WCFS1. This advantage of this method is demonstrated in terms of shorter experimental duration and the possibility to introduce a gene incompatible with E. coli into L. plantarum WCFS1.",

          "description": "Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science, Volume 32, Issue 9, September 2022. \nSupply-chain systems (SCSs) are an indispensable part of our daily infrastructures. Note that a small perturbation in a SCS can be amplified, eliciting cascading failures. It is of significant value to ensure a high resilience of SCSs. However, due to the complexity of SCSs, it is quite challenging to study their resilience under conditions of perturbations. In view of this, this paper presents a complex network perspective toward the resilience of SCSs. To achieve this goal, a complex SCS is modeled as a multilayer supply-chain network (SCN) with physical organizations being modeled as nodes and interactions among them as edges. A modeled SCN contains three types of nodes, i.e., suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers. An algorithm is proposed to construct a multilayer SCN. For each layer of a multilayer SCN, two kinds of networks, i.e., networks with Poisson degree distributions and networks with power-law degree distributions, are considered. For a given multilayer SCN, a ripple-effect network model is proposed to analyze its resilience under perturbations. Regarding the perturbations, two scenarios, i.e., random node failures and target node failures, are adopted in this research. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed network perspective, simulations on computer-generated SCNs are carried out. Interestingly, it is found that the resilience of SCNs under both random and target perturbations presents a discontinuous phase-change phenomenon, which indicates that SCNs are quite fragile under perturbations. It is further noticed that SCNs with power-law degree distributions are relatively more robust than SCNs with Poisson degree distributions. Although SCNs are found to be fragile, it has been discovered that denser interactions between different system organizations can enhance the network’s resilience.",

We say that a network is globally synchronizing if the oscillators converge to the all-in-phase synchronous state for almost all initial conditions. Is there a critical threshold for [math] above which global synchrony is extremely likely but below which it is extremely rare? It is suspected that a critical threshold exists and is close to the so-called connectivity threshold, namely, [math] for [math].

The self-organization process involves the formation of two types of patches, majority and minority ones, characterized by uniform average spiking frequencies. Patched patterns may be temporally periodic, quasiperiodic, or chaotic, whereby chaotic patterns may further develop interfaces comprised of units with average frequencies in between those of majority and minority patches. Using chaos and bifurcation theory, we demonstrate that chaos typically emerges via a torus breakup and identify the secondary bifurcation that gives rise to chaotic interfaces. It is shown that the maximal Lyapunov exponent of chaotic patched patterns does not decay, but rather converges to a finite value with system size. Patched patterns with a smaller wavenumber may exhibit diffusive motion of chaotic interfaces, similar to that of the incoherent part of chimeras.",

Unfortunately, the system faces inevitable perturbations of extreme events and is frequently damaged. To maintain the system's stability, recovering its damaged functionality is essential and is complementary to strengthening its resilience and forecasting extreme events. This paper proposes a target recovery method based on network and economic equilibrium theories to defend the economic system against perturbations characterized as localized attacks. This novel method stimulates a set of economic sectors that mutually reinforce damaged economic sectors and is intuitively named the target reinforcement path (TRP) method. Developing a nonlinear dynamic model that simulates the economic system's operation after being perturbed by a localized attack and recovering based on a target recovery method, we compute the relaxation time for this process to quantify the method's efficiency. Furthermore, we adopt a rank aggregation method to comprehensively measure the method's efficiency by studying the target recovery of three country-level economic systems (China, India, and Japan) for 73 different regional attack scenarios. Through a comparative analysis of the TRP method and three other classic methods, the TRP method is shown to be more effective and less costly. Applicatively, the proposed method exhibits the potential to recover other vital complex systems with spontaneous recovery ability, such as immune, neurological, and ecological systems.",

The space of parameters where both resources coexist is explored numerically. The results indicate that oscillations of [math] and mutually synchronized [math], which appear equal for the rates of consumption, are destabilized when these rates are modified.

Understanding, recognizing, and predicting these HTEs and researching their occurrence rules provides theoretical and decision-making support for preventing system congestion. Communication sectors are regarded as nodes, and if HTEs occur synchronously among sectors, then the corresponding nodes are connected. The total number of synchronous HTEs determines the edge weights. The mobile-communication spatiotemporal data are mapped to a weighted network, with the occurrence locations of HTEs as the basic elements. Network analysis provides a structure for representing the interaction of HTEs. By analyzing the topological features of the event synchronization network, the associations among the occurrence times of HTEs can be mined. We find that the event synchronization network is a small-world network, the cumulative strength distribution is exponential, and the edge weight obeys a power law. Moreover, the node clustering coefficient is negatively correlated with the node degree. A congestion coefficient based on several topological parameters is proposed, and the system congestion is visualized. The congestion coefficient contains information about the synchronous occurrence of HTEs between a sector and its neighbors and information about the synchronous occurrence of HTEs among its neighbors. For the mobile communication system considered in this study, the congestion coefficient of a large number of sectors is small and the risk of system congestion is low.",

Expansion of meristematic tissue is derived from the growth and division of stem cells that reside in a central zone of the SAM. This reservoir of stem cells is maintained by expression of a transcription factor WUSCHEL that is responsible for the development of stem cells in the central zone. WUSCHEL expression is self-activating and downregulated by a signaling pathway initiated by CLAVATA proteins, which are upregulated by WUSCHEL. This classic activator–inhibitor network can generate localized patterns of WUSCHEL activity by a Turing instability provided certain constraints on reaction rates and diffusion constants of WUSCHEL and CLAVATA are satisfied, and most existing mathematical models of nucleation and confinement of stem cells in the SAM rely on Turing's mechanism. However, Turing patterns have certain properties that are inconsistent with observed patterns of stem cell differentiation in the SAM. As an alternative mechanism, we propose a model for stem cell confinement based on a bistable-switch in WUSCHEL–CLAVATA interactions. We study the bistable-switch mechanism for pattern formation in a spatially continuous domain and in a discrete cellularized tissue in the presence of a non-uniform field of a rapidly diffusing hormone. By comparing domain formation by Turing and bistable-switch mechanisms in these contexts, we show that bistable switching provides a superior account of nucleation and confinement of the stem cell domain under reasonable assumptions on reaction rates and diffusion constants.",

The correlation and diffusion properties of this random motion are fully characterized by its index of self-similarity or the Hurst exponent. However, recent single-particle tracking experiments in biological cells revealed highly complicated anomalous diffusion phenomena that cannot be attributed to a class of self-similar random processes. Inspired by these observations, we here study the process that preserves the properties of the fractional Brownian motion at a single trajectory level; however, the Hurst index randomly changes from trajectory to trajectory. We provide a general mathematical framework for analytical, numerical, and statistical analysis of the fractional Brownian motion with the random Hurst exponent. The explicit formulas for probability density function, mean-squared displacement, and autocovariance function of the increments are presented for three generic distributions of the Hurst exponent, namely, two-point, uniform, and beta distributions. The important features of the process studied here are accelerating diffusion and persistence transition, which we demonstrate analytically and numerically.",

The concept of lobe dynamics admits exact and unique geometric demarcation of this region and, inherently, distinction of the portions of chaotic seas with essentially linear vs nonlinear Lagrangian transport. This, furthermore, admits explicit establishment of a topological equivalence between the (embedded) Hamiltonian structure of the Lagrangian dynamics in 2D (3D) flows and their canonical form. The linear transport region in physical space encompasses four adjacent subregions that each corresponds to one of the four quadrants in canonical space and may exchange material with their environment in two essentially nonlinear ways. First, exchange between quadrants within the linear transport region and, second, exchange with the exterior of this region.

We show that this system exhibits strange spiral attractors (Shilnikov attractors) with two zero (indistinguishable from zero in numerics) Lyapunov exponents in a wide region of the parameter space. We explain this phenomenon by means of bifurcation analysis of a three-dimensional Poincaré map for the system under consideration. We show that chaotic dynamics develop here near a codimension three bifurcation, when a periodic orbit (fixed point of the Poincaré map) has the triplet of multipliers [math]. As it is known, the flow normal form for such bifurcation is the well-known three-dimensional Arneodó–Coullet–Spiegel–Tresser (ACST) system, which exhibits spiral attractors. According to this, we conclude that the additional zero Lyapunov exponent for orbits in the observed attractors appears due to the fact that the corresponding three-dimensional Poincaré map is very close to the time-shift map of the ACST-system.",

Therefore, we describe an alternative method based on persistent homology—a tool from topological data analysis—that utilizes Betti numbers and CROCKER plots. Betti numbers are topological invariants of topological spaces, while the CROCKER plot is a coarsened but easy to visualize data representation of a one-parameter varying family of persistence barcodes. The specific bifurcations we investigate are transitions from periodic to chaotic behavior or vice versa in a one-parameter collection of differential equations. We validate our methods using numerical experiments on ten dynamical systems and contrast the results with existing tools that use the maximum Lyapunov exponent. We further prove the relationship between the Wasserstein distance to the empty diagram and the norm of the Betti vector, which shows that an even more simplified version of the information has the potential to provide insight into the bifurcation parameter. The results show that our approach reveals more information about the shape of the periodic attractor than standard tools, and it has more favorable computational time in comparison with the Rösenstein algorithm for computing the maximum Lyapunov exponent.",

However, the input of the emotion recognition model is often a whole set of EEG channels obtained by electrodes placed on subjects. The unnecessary information produced by redundant channels affects the recognition rate and depletes computing resources, thereby hindering the practical applications of emotion recognition. In this work, we aim to optimize the input of EEG channels using a visibility graph (VG) and genetic algorithm-based convolutional neural network (GA-CNN). First, we design an experiment to evoke three types of emotion states using movies and collect the multi-channel EEG signals of each subject under different emotion states. Then, we construct VGs for each EEG channel and derive nonlinear features representing each EEG channel. We employ the genetic algorithm (GA) to find the optimal subset of EEG channels for emotion recognition and use the recognition results of the CNN as fitness values. The experimental results show that the recognition performance of the proposed method using a subset of EEG channels is superior to that of the CNN using all channels for each subject. Last, based on the subset of EEG channels searched by the GA-CNN, we perform cross-subject emotion recognition tasks employing leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in recognizing emotion states using fewer EEG channels and further enrich the methods of EEG classification using nonlinear features.",

At first, a new asymmetric branch separates from the fundamental symmetric soliton at the first power critical point, and then, the asymmetric branch passes through the branch of the fundamental symmetric soliton and finally merges into the branch of the fundamental symmetric soliton at the second power critical point, while the power of the soliton increases. This leads to the symmetry breaking and double-loop bifurcation of fundamental symmetric solitons. From the power-propagation constant curves of solitons, symmetric fundamental and tripole solitons, asymmetric solitons can also exist. The stability of symmetric fundamental solitons, asymmetric solitons, and symmetric tripole solitons is discussed by the linear stability analysis and direct simulation. Results indicate that symmetric fundamental solitons and symmetric tripole solitons tend to be stable with the increase in the soliton power. Asymmetric solitons are unstable in both high and low power regions. Moreover, with the increase in saturable nonlinearity, the stability region of fundamental symmetric solitons and symmetric tripole solitons becomes wider.",

This model describes nonparaxial ultrashort pulse propagation in an optical medium in the presence of spatial dispersion originating from the failure of slowly varying envelope approximation. We show that this system admits periodic (elliptic) solitary waves with a dipole structure within a period and also a transition from a dipole to quadrupole structure within a period depending on the value of the modulus parameter of a Jacobi elliptic function. The parametric conditions to be satisfied for the existence of these solutions are given. The effect of the nonparaxial parameter on physical quantities, such as amplitude, pulse width, and speed of the solitary waves, is examined. It is found that by adjusting the nonparaxial parameter, the speed of solitary waves can be decelerated. The stability and robustness of the solitary waves are discussed numerically.",

This aspect has been studied intensively in social dilemmas where competing players’ individual and collective interests are in conflict. Starting from the traditional public goods game model, where players are locally fixed and unconditional cooperators or defectors are present, we introduce two additional strategies through which agents can change their positions of dependence on the local cooperation level. More importantly, these so-called sophisticated players should bear an extra cost to maintain their permanent capacity to evaluate their neighborhood and react accordingly. Hence, four strategies compete, and the most successful one can be imitated by its neighbors. Crucially, the introduction of costly movement has a highly biased consequence on the competing main strategies. In the majority of parameter space, it is harmful to defectors and provides a significantly higher cooperation level when the population is rare. At an intermediate population density, which would be otherwise optimal for a system of immobile players, the presence of mobile actors could be detrimental if the interaction pattern changes slightly, thereby blocking the optimal percolation of information flow. In this parameter space, sophisticated cooperators can also show the co-called Moor effect by first avoiding the harmful vicinity of defectors; they subsequently transform into an immobile cooperator state. Hence, paradoxically, the additional cost of movement could be advantageous to reach a higher general income, especially for a rare population when subgroups would be isolated otherwise.",

However, the symmetries of globally and identically coupled identical units do not allow solutions where distinct oscillators are frequency-unlocked—a necessary condition for the emergence of chimeras. Thus, forced symmetry breaking is necessary to observe chimera-type solutions. Here, we consider the bifurcations that arise when full permutational symmetry is broken for the network to consist of coupled populations. We consider the smallest possible network composed of four phase oscillators and elucidate the phase space structure, (partial) integrability for some parameter values, and how the bifurcations away from full symmetry lead to frequency-unlocked weak chimera solutions. Since such solutions wind around a torus they must arise in a global bifurcation scenario. Moreover, periodic weak chimeras undergo a period-doubling cascade leading to chaos. The resulting chaotic dynamics with distinct frequencies do not rely on amplitude variation and arise in the smallest networks that support chaos.",

To explore neural behaviors and complexity mechanisms in memristive circuits, this paper proposes an N-type locally active memristor, based on which a third-order memristive circuit is constructed. Theoretical analysis shows that the memristive circuit can exhibit not only various action potentials but also self-sustained oscillation and chaos. Based on Chua's theory of local activity, this paper finds that the neural behaviors and chaos emerge near the edge of chaos through subcritical Hopf bifurcation, in which the small unstable limit cycle is depicted by the dividing line between the attraction basin of the large stable limit cycle and the attraction basin of the stable equilibrium point. Furthermore, an analog circuit is designed to imitate the action potentials and chaos, and the simulation results are in agreement with the theoretical analysis.",

We investigate the role of infection fatality ratio (IFR) and social contact matrices on vaccination prioritization using a compartmental epidemic model fueled by real-world data of different diseases and countries. Our study confirms that massive and early vaccination is extremely effective to reduce the disease fatality if the contagion is mitigated, but the effectiveness is increasingly reduced as vaccination beginning delays in an uncontrolled epidemiological scenario. The optimal and least effective prioritization strategies depend non-linearly on epidemiological variables. Regions of the epidemiological parameter space, in which prioritizing the most vulnerable population is more effective than the most contagious individuals, depend strongly on the IFR age profile being, for example, substantially broader for COVID-19 in comparison with seasonal influenza.
