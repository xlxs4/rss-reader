          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we develop new second-order low-dissipation central-upwind (LDCU) schemes for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. Like all of the Godunov-type schemes, the proposed LDCU schemes are developed in three steps: reconstruction, evolution, and projection. A major novelty of our approach is in the projection step, which is based on a subcell resolution and designed to sharper approximate contact waves while ensuring a non-oscillatory property of the projected solution. In order to achieve this goal, we take into account properties of the contact waves. We design the LDCU schemes for both the one- and two-dimensional Euler equations of gas dynamics. The new schemes are tested on a variety of numerical examples. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that the proposed LDCU schemes contain substantially smaller amount of numerical dissipation and achieve higher resolution compared with their existing counterparts.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this work, we formulate a class of multiscale inverse problems within the framework of reinforcement learning (RL) and solve it by a sampling method. We propose a multi-agent actor-critic RL algorithm to accelerate the multi-level Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling once the problem is formulated as an RL process. The policies of the agents are used to generate proposals in the MCMC steps, and the critic, which is centralized, is in charge of estimating the expected reward. There are several difficulties in the implementation of the inverse problem involving features of multiple scales by using traditional MCMC sampling. Firstly, the computation of the posterior distribution involves evaluating the forward solver, which is time-consuming for problems with heterogeneities. This motivates to use the type of multi-level algorithms. Secondly, it is hard to find a proper transition function. To overcome these issues, we learn an RL policy as the proposal generator. We verify our proposed algorithm by solving different benchmark cases of multiscale inverse problems. Our experiments show that the proposed method improves the sampling process and speeds up the residual convergence.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this work, we propose and analyze a high-order mapping operator between two grids to construct a high-order two-grid difference algorithm for nonlinear partial differential equations. This algorithm is then applied to solve a nonlinear time-fractional biharmonic equation for illustration, in which the cut-off technique and the auxiliary scheme approach are used to reduce the requirement on the nonlinear term to the local Lipschitz continuous condition, and the energy estimates are performed to avoid the usage of the inverse estimates and thus the time-step conditions. To treat the fractional operator, the Alikhanov’s scheme on the graded mesh is applied to deal with the weak singularity at initial time, while the compact difference method based on the order reduction is employed for high-order spatial discretization. The above methods and improvements as well as the properties of the high-order mapping operator are integrated with the analysis of the two-grid method to prove the unique solvability and the unconditionally robust error estimates of the proposed schemes under different norms. The developed techniques are further extended to discretize and analyze the two-grid method of two-dimensional problems. Numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the two-grid algorithms.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn the context of preserving stationary states, e.g. lake at rest and moving equilibria, a new formulation of the shallow water system, called flux globalization has been introduced by Cheng et al. (J Sci Comput 80(1):538–554, 2019). This approach consists in including the integral of the source term in the global flux and reconstructing the new global flux rather than the conservative variables. The resulting scheme is able to preserve a large family of smooth and discontinuous steady state moving equilibria. In this work, we focus on an arbitrary high order WENO finite volume (FV) generalization of the global flux approach. The most delicate aspect of the algorithm is the appropriate definition of the source flux (integral of the source term) and the quadrature strategy used to match it with the WENO reconstruction of the hyperbolic flux. When this construction is correctly done, one can show that the resulting WENO FV scheme admits exact discrete steady states characterized by constant global fluxes. We also show that, by an appropriate quadrature strategy for the source, we can embed exactly some particular steady states, e.g. the lake at rest for the shallow water equations. It can be shown that an exact approximation of global fluxes leads to a scheme with better convergence properties and improved solutions. The novel method has been tested and validated on classical cases: subcritical, supercritical and transcritical flows.",

          "description": "Abstract\nA defining feature of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for ODE is that the piecewise polynomial solution can have a jump discontinuity at the beginning of each step. Starting from the standard integral formulation, the DG method is derived here in differential form. The key ingredient is a polynomial called the correction function, which helps ‘correct’ the discontinuous solution by approximating the jump and yields a continuous one. Under the right Radau quadrature, this continuous solution is shown to be identical to the solutions by the right Radau collocation and the continuous Galerkin (CG) methods. Next, the correction function facilitates the construction of the associated implicit Runge–Kutta schemes (IRK-DG). Different quadratures for DG result in different IRK-DG methods: left Radau quadrature in Radau IA, right Radau quadrature in Radau IIA or right Radau collocation, and Gauss quadrature in a method called DG-Gauss. The construction of IRK-DG via correction function also clarifies the meaning and facilitates the proofs of various \n                      \n                      \\(B(p)\\)\n                      \n                    , \n                      \n                      \\(C(\\eta )\\)\n                      \n                    , and \n                      \n                      \\(D(\\zeta )\\)\n                      \n                     conditions for accuracy.

In this paper, we study positivity preserving time integration schemes by means of exponential integrators.

A key step is that we prove a lower bound theory for the nonzero entries of the gradient of the iterative sequence when both box constraint and simplex constraint are involved in the target energy minimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical attempt at the non-Lipschitz piecewise constant Mumford–Shah model.

In a stochastic reaction network setting we consider the problem of tracking the fate of individual molecules. We show that by using the classical large volume limit results, we may approximate the dynamics of a single tracked molecule in a simple and computationally efficient way. We give examples on how this approach may be used to obtain various characteristics of single-molecule dynamics (for instance, the distribution of the number of infections in a single individual in the course of an epidemic or the activity time of a single enzyme molecule). Moreover, we show how to approximate the overall dynamics of species of interest in the full system with a collection of independent single-molecule trajectories, and give explicit bounds for the approximation error in terms of the reaction rates. This approximation, which is well defined for all times, leads to an efficient and fully parallelizable simulation technique for which we provide some numerical examples.",

In this paper, we use geometric singular perturbation theory and blowup as our main technical tool to study the mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) that occur in two coupled FitzHugh–Nagumo units with symmetric and repulsive coupling. In particular, we demonstrate that the MMOs in this model are not due to generic folded singularities, but rather due to singularities at a cusp – not a fold – of the critical manifold. Using blowup, we determine the number of small-amplitude oscillations (SAOs) analytically, showing–-as for the folded nodes–-that they are determined by the Weber equation and the ratio of eigenvalues. We also show that the model undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation in the desingularized reduced problem, which–-although resembling a folded saddle-node (type II) at this level–-also occurs on a cusp, and not a fold. We demonstrate that this bifurcation is associated with the emergence of an invariant cylinder, the onset of SAOs, as well as SAOs of increasing amplitude. We relate our findings with numerical computations and find excellent agreement.",

We analyze a class of stochastic processes, referred to as asynchronous and semianonymous dynamics (ASD), over directed labeled random networks. These processes are a natural tool to describe general best-response and noisy best-response dynamics in network games where each agent, at random times governed by independent Poisson clocks, can choose among a finite set of actions. The payoff is determined by the relative frequency of the different actions among neighbors while being independent of the specific identities of neighbors. Using a local mean-field approach, we prove rigorously that, under certain conditions on the network and initial node configuration, the evolution of ASD can be approximated, in the large-scale limit, by the solution of a system of nonlinear ODEs. Our framework is very general and applies to a large class of graph ensembles for which the typical random graph is locally tree-like. In particular, we focus on labeled configuration-model random graphs, a generalization of the traditional configuration model which allows different classes of nodes to be mixed together in the network, permitting us, for example, to incorporate a community structure in the system. Our analysis also applies to configuration-model graphs having a power-law degree distribution, an essential feature of many real systems. To demonstrate the power and flexibility of our framework, we consider several examples of dynamics belonging to our class of stochastic processes. Moreover, we illustrate by simulation the applicability of our analysis to realistic scenarios by running our example dynamics over a real social network graph.",

Under the assumption of mass-action kinetics, a dynamical system may be induced by several different reaction networks and/or parameters. It is therefore possible for a mass-action system to exhibit complex-balancing dynamics without being weakly reversible or satisfying toric constraints on the rate constants; such systems are called disguised toric dynamical systems. We show that the parameters that give rise to such systems are preserved under invertible affine transformations of the network.

We study the cardinality of collisions between Kuramoto oscillators in the (asymptotic) phase-locking process in the presence of inertia. In the absence of inertia, it has been known that the finiteness of collisions between oscillators is equivalent to the emergence of phase-locking. Thus, a natural question is whether this finiteness result is still valid for the Kuramoto model with inertia or not. In a small inertia regime, we show that the finiteness of collisions is also equivalent to phase-locking like the Kuramoto model. In contrast, in a large inertia regime, we show that a homogeneous Kuramoto ensemble with the same natural frequency can exhibit phase-locking, while there are a countable number of collisions between Kuramoto oscillators. This is the contrasted effect of a large inertia in the phase-locking process.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 1445-1471, June 2023. \n Abstract. Koopman analysis provides a general theoretical underpinning for widely used dynamic mode decomposition algorithms which approximate the behavior of a nonlinear dynamical system using a linear operator. While such methods have proven to be remarkably useful in the analysis of time-series data, the resulting linear models must generally be of high order to accurately approximate fundamentally nonlinear behaviors. This issue poses an inherent risk of overfitting to training data, thereby limiting predictive capabilities. By contrast, this work explores strategies for nonlinear data-driven system identification using strategies inspired by Koopman analysis. General strategies that yield nonlinear models are presented for systems both with and without control. Subsequent projection of the resulting nonlinear equations onto a low-rank basis yields a low-order representation for the underlying dynamical system. In both computational and experimental examples considered in this work, linear estimators of the Koopman operator are generally only able to provide short-term predictions for the observable dynamics, while comparable nonlinear estimators for the system dynamics provide accurate predictions on substantially longer timescales and replicate infinite-time behaviors that linear predictors cannot.",
