          "description": "Abstract\nIt is known that standard stochastic Galerkin methods encounter challenges when solving partial differential equations with high-dimensional random inputs, which are typically caused by the large number of stochastic basis functions required. It becomes crucial to properly choose effective basis functions, such that the dimension of the stochastic approximation space can be reduced. In this work, we focus on the stochastic Galerkin approximation associated with generalized polynomial chaos (gPC), and explore the gPC expansion based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition. A concise form of the gPC expansion is presented for each component function of the ANOVA expansion, and an adaptive ANOVA procedure is proposed to construct the overall stochastic Galerkin system. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed adaptive ANOVA stochastic Galerkin method for both diffusion and Helmholtz problems.",

          "description": "Abstract\nSimulating discontinuities has been a long-standing challenge, especially when dealing with shock waves characterized by strong nonlinear features. Despite their promise, the recently developed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have not yet fully demonstrated their effectiveness in handling discontinuities when compared to traditional shock-capturing methods. In this study, we reveal a paradoxical phenomenon during the training of PINNs when computing problems with strong nonlinear discontinuities. To address this issue and enhance the PINNs’ ability to capture shocks, we propose PINNs-WE (Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Equation Weight) method by introducing three novel strategies. Firstly, we attenuate the neural network’s expression locally at ‘transition points’ within the shock waves by introducing a physics-dependent weight into the governing equations. Consequently, the neural network will concentrate on training the smoother parts of the solutions. As a result, due to the compressible property, sharp discontinuities emerge, with transition points being compressed into well-trained smooth regions akin to passive particles. Secondly, we also introduce the Rankine–Hugoniot (RH) relation, which is equivalent to the weak form of the conservation laws near the discontinuity, in order to improve the shock-capturing preformance. Lastly, we construct a global physical conservation constraint to enhance the conservation properties of PINNs which is key to resolve the right position of the discontinuity. To illustrate the impact of our novel approach, we investigate the behavior of the one-dimensional Burgers’ equation, as well as the one- and two-dimensional Euler equations. In our numerical experiments, we compare our proposed PINNs-WE method with a traditional high-order weighted essential non-oscillatory (WENO) approach. The results of our study highlight the significant enhancement in discontinuity computing by the PINNs-WE method when compared to traditional PINNs.",

          "description": "Abstract\nEfficient and fast computation of a tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) with a few passes over the underlying data tensor is crucial because of its many potential applications. The current/existing subspace randomized algorithms need \n                      \n                      \\((2q+2)\\)\n                      \n                     passes over the data tensor to compute a t-SVD, where q is a non-negative integer number (power iteration parameter). In this paper, we propose an efficient and flexible randomized algorithm that can handle any number of passes q, which not necessary need be even. The flexibility of the proposed algorithm in using fewer passes naturally leads to lower computational and communication costs. This advantage makes it particularly appropriate when our task calls for several tensor decompositions or when the data tensors are huge. The proposed algorithm is a generalization of the methods developed for matrices to tensors. The expected/average error bound of the proposed algorithm is derived. Extensive numerical experiments on random and real-world data sets are conducted, and the proposed algorithm is compared with some baseline algorithms. The extensive computer simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is practical, efficient, and in general outperforms the state of the arts algorithms. We also demonstrate how to use the proposed method to develop a fast algorithm for the tensor completion problem.",

This work presents a systematic methodology for describing the transient dynamics of coarse-grained molecular systems inferred from all-atom simulated data. We suggest Langevin-type dynamics where the coarse-grained interaction potential depends explicitly on time to efficiently approximate the transient coarse-grained dynamics. We apply the path-space force matching approach at the transient dynamics regime to learn the proposed model parameters. In particular, we parameterize the coarse-grained potential both with respect to the pair distance of the coarse-grained particles and the time, and we obtain an evolution model that is explicitly time dependent. Moreover, we follow a data-driven approach to estimate the friction kernel, given by appropriate correlation functions directly from the underlying all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. To explore and validate the proposed methodology we study a benchmark system of a moving particle in a box. We examine the suggested model’s effectiveness in terms of the system’s correlation time and find that the model can well approximate the transient time regime of the system, depending on the correlation time of the system. As a result, in the less correlated case, it can represent the dynamics for a longer time interval. We present an extensive study of our approach to a realistic high-dimensional water molecular system. Posing the water system initially out of thermal equilibrium we collect trajectories of all-atom data for the, empirically estimated, transient time regime. Then, we infer the suggested model and strengthen the model’s validity by comparing it with simplified Markovian models.",

We investigate an optimal control model with pointwise constraints governed by a two-time-scale time-fractional advection-diffusion-reaction equation with space-time-dependent fractional order and coefficients, which describes, e.g., the contaminant in groundwater under various transport scales or miscible displacement of hydrocarbon by injected fluid through heterogeneous porous media. To accommodate for the effects of complex fractional order and coefficients, an auxiliary equation method is proposed, along with the Fredholm alternative for compact operators, to analyze the well-posedness of the state equation. Additionally, a bootstrapping argument is utilized to progressively improve the solution regularity through a carefully designed pathway, leading to the maximal regularity estimates. Subsequently, we analyze the adjoint equation derived from the first-order optimality condition, which requires more subtle treatments due to the presence of hidden-memory variable-order fractional operators. Based on these findings, we ultimately analyze the well-posedness, first-order optimality conditions and maximal regularity estimates for the optimal control problem, and we conduct numerical experiments to investigate its behavior in potential applications.",

For many engineered systems it is important to assess vulnerability to potential disturbances in order to ensure reliable operation. Whether the system will recover from a particular finite-time disturbance to a desired stable equilibrium point depends on uncertain and time-varying system parameter values. Therefore, it is valuable to determine, for specific fixed disturbances, the margins for safe operation: the smallest change in parameter values that would cause the system to become vulnerable to the disturbance. The natural setting for this problem is a parameter-dependent vector field with a family of stable equilibria and a parameter-dependent initial condition representing the d…",

E, 78 (2008), 066609] consists of an empty drinks can standing upright on a horizontal plane which, when tipped back to a single contact point and released, rocks down towards the flat and level state. At the bottom of the motion, the contact point moves quickly around the rim of the can. The can then rises up again, having rotated through some finite angle of turn [math]. We recast the problem as a second order ODE and find a Frobenius solution. We then use this Frobenius solution to derive a reduced equation of motion. The rocking can exhibits two distinct phenomena: behavior very similar to an inverted pendulum, and dynamics with the angle of turn. This distinction allows us to use matched asymptotic expansions to derive a uniformly valid solution that is in excellent agreement with numerical calculations of the reduced equation of motion. The solution of the inner problem was used to investigate of the angle of turn phenomenon. We also examine the motion of the contact locus [math] and see a range of different trajectories, from circular to petaloid motion and even cusp-like behavior.

The intention of this article is to illustrate the use of methods from symplectic geometry for practical purposes. Our intended audience is scientists interested in orbits of Hamiltonian systems (e.g., the three-body problem). The main directions pursued in this article are as follows: (1) given two periodic orbits, decide when they can be connected by a regular family of periodic orbits; (2) use numerical invariants from Floer theory which help predict the existence of orbits in the presence of a bifurcation; (3) attach a sign [math] to each elliptic or hyperbolic Floquet multiplier of a closed symmetric orbit, which generalizes the classical Krein–Moser sign to also include the hyperbolic case; and (4) do all of the above in a visual, easily implementable, and resource-efficient way. The mathematical framework is provided by the first and third authors in [U. Frauenfelder and A. Moreno, J. Symplectic Geom., to appear], where, as it turns out, the “Broucke stability diagram” [R. Broucke, AIAA J., 7 (1969), pp. 1003–1009] was rediscovered, but further refined with the above signs and algebraically reformulated in terms of quotients of the symplectic group. The advantage of the framework is that it applies to the study of closed orbits of an arbitrary Hamiltonian system. We will carry out numerical work based on the cell-mapping method as described in [D. Koh, R. L. Anderson, and I. Bermejo-Moreno, J. Astronautical Sci., 68 (2021), pp. 172–196] for the Jupiter-Europa and Saturn-Enceladus systems.

We present an effective model of “space-coiled metacrystals” composed of a periodic array of sound rigid blocks into which long slots have been coiled up. The periodic cell of the block contains a coiled slot whose straight parts are at wavelength scale, which enables the appearance of Bragg resonances. These resonances, which prevent high transmission, compete with the Fabry–Pérot resonances of the entire slot, which foster perfect transmission. This results in complex scattering properties driven by the characteristics of the turning regions that act as atoms in a one-dimensional coiled crystal. Using appropriate scaling and combining two-scale homogenization with matched asymptotic techniques, the modeling of such metacrystals is proposed. The resulting model is validated through a comparison with full-wave numerics in both harmonic and transient regimes.",

In this paper, a coupled electro-calcium model was developed and implemented to computationally explore the effects of neuronal synapse loss, in particular in the context of Alzheimer’s disease. Established parameters affected by Alzheimer’s disease, such as synapse loss, calcium leaks at deteriorating synaptic contacts, and downregulation of the calcium buffer calbindin, are subject to this study. Reconstructed neurons are used to define the computational domain for a system of PDEs and ODEs, discretized by finite differences and solved with a semi-implicit second-order time integrator. The results show neuronal resilience during synapse loss. When incorporating calcium leaks at affected synapses, neurons lose their ability to produce synapse-to-nucleus calcium signals, necessary for learning, plasticity, and neuronal survival. Downregulation of calbindin concentrations partially recovers the signaling pathway to the cell nucleus. These results could define future research pathways toward stabilizing the calcium signaling pathways during Alzheimer’s disease. The coupled electro-calcium model was implemented and solved using MATLAB https://github.com/NeuroBox3D/CalcSim.",

The aim of this article is to advance the field of metamaterials by proposing formulas for the design of high-contrast metamaterials with prescribed subwavelength defect mode eigenfrequencies. This is achieved in two settings: (i) design of non-Hermitian static materials and (ii) design of instantly changing non-Hermitian time-dependent materials. The design of static materials is achieved via characterizing equations for the defect mode eigenfrequencies in the setting of a defected dimer material. These characterizing equations are the basis for obtaining formulas for the material parameters of the defect which admit given defect mode eigenfrequencies. Explicit formulas are provided in the setting of one and two given defect mode eigenfrequencies in the setting of a defected chain of dimers. In the time-dependent case, we first analyze the influence of time boundaries on the subwavelength solutions. We find that subwavelength solutions are preserved if and only if the material parameters satisfy a temporal Snell’s law across the time boundary. The same result also identifies the change of the time frequencies uniquely. Combining this result with those on the design of static materials, we obtain an explicit formula for the material design of instantly changing defected dimer materials which admit subwavelength modes with prescribed time-dependent defect mode eigenfrequency. Finally, we use this formula to create materials which admit spatio-temporally localized defect modes.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 52, Issue 6, Page FOCS18-349-FOCS18-382, December 2023. \n Abstract. There are significant obstacles to establishing an equivalence between the worst-case and average-case hardness of [math]. Several results suggest that black-box worst-case to average-case reductions are not likely to be used for reducing any worst-case problem outside [math] to a distributional [math] problem. This paper overcomes the barrier. We present the first non-black-box worst-case to average-case reduction from a problem conjectured to be outside [math] to a distributional [math] problem. Specifically, we consider the minimum time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity problem (MINKT) and prove that there exists a zero-error randomized polynomial-time algorithm approximating the minimum time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity [math] within an additive error [math] if its average-case version admits an errorless heuristic polynomial-time algorithm. We observe that the approximation version of MINKT is Random 3SAT-hard, and more generally it is harder than avoiding any polynomial-time computable hitting set generator that extends its seed of length [math] by [math], which provides strong evidence that the approximation problem is outside [math] and thus our reductions are non-black-box. Our reduction can be derandomized at the cost of the quality of the approximation. We also show that, given a truth table of size [math], approximating the minimum circuit size within a factor of [math] is in [math] for some constant [math] iff its average-case version is easy. Our results can be seen as a new approach for excluding Heuristica. In particular, proving [math]-hardness of the approximation versions of MINKT or the minimum circuit size problem is sufficient for establishing an equivalence between the worst-case and average-case hardness of [math].",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 52, Issue 6, Page 1413-1463, December 2023. \n Abstract. We prove a general structural theorem for a wide family of local algorithms, which includes property testers, local decoders, and probabilistically checkable proofs of proximity. Namely, we show that the structure of every algorithm that makes [math] adaptive queries and satisfies a natural robustness condition admits a sample-based algorithm with [math] sample complexity, following the definition of Goldreich and Ron [ACM Trans. Comput. Theory, 8 (2016), 7]. We prove that this transformation is nearly optimal. Our theorem also admits a scheme for constructing privacy-preserving local algorithms. Using the unified view that our structural theorem provides, we obtain results regarding various types of local algorithms, including the following. We strengthen the state-of-the-art lower bound for relaxed locally decodable codes, obtaining an exponential improvement on the dependency in query complexity; this resolves an open problem raised by Gur and Lachish [SIAM J. Comput., 50 (2021), pp. 788–813]. We show that any (constant-query) testable property admits a sample-based tester with sublinear sample complexity; this resolves a problem left open in a work of Fischer, Lachish, and Vasudev [Proceedings of the 56th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE, 2015, pp. 1163–1182], bypassing an exponential blowup caused by previous techniques in the case of adaptive testers. We prove that the known separation between proofs of proximity and testers is essentially maximal; this resolves a problem left open by Gur and Rothblum [Proceedings of the 8th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference, 2017, pp. 39:1–39:43; Comput. Complexity, 27 (2018), pp. 99–207] regarding sublinear-time delegation of computation. Our techniques strongly rely on relaxed sunflower lemmas and the Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem.",
