          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper presents a new strategy to deal with the excessive diffusion that standard finite volume methods for compressible Euler equations display in the limit of low Mach number. The strategy can be understood as using centered discretizations for the acoustic part of the Euler equations and stabilizing them with a leap-frog-type (“sequential explicit”) time integration, a fully explicit method. This time integration takes inspiration from time-explicit staggered grid numerical methods. In this way, advantages of staggered methods carry over to collocated methods. The paper provides a number of new collocated schemes for linear acoustic/Maxwell equations that are inspired by the Yee scheme. They are then extended to an all-speed method for the full Euler equations on Cartesian grids. By taking the opposite view and taking inspiration from collocated methods, the paper also suggests a new way of staggering the variables which increases the stability as compared to the traditional Yee scheme.",

          "description": "Abstract\nProper orthogonal decomposition (POD) allows reduced-order modeling of complex dynamical systems at a substantial level, while maintaining a high degree of accuracy in modeling the underlying dynamical systems. Advances in machine learning algorithms enable learning POD-based dynamics from data and making accurate and fast predictions of dynamical systems. This paper extends the recently proposed heavy-ball neural ODEs (HBNODEs) (Xia et al. NeurIPS, 2021] for learning data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) in the POD context, in particular, for learning dynamics of time-varying coefficients generated by the POD analysis on training snapshots constructed by solving full-order models. HBNODE enjoys several practical advantages for learning POD-based ROMs with theoretical guarantees, including 1) HBNODE can learn long-range dependencies effectively from sequential observations, which is crucial for learning intrinsic patterns from sequential data, and 2) HBNODE is computationally efficient in both training and testing. We compare HBNODE with other popular ROMs on several complex dynamical systems, including the von Kármán Street flow, the Kurganov-Petrova-Popov equation, and the one-dimensional Euler equations for fluids modeling.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe diffusive-viscous wave equation (DVWE) is widely used in seismic exploration since it can explain frequency-dependent seismic reflections in a reservoir with hydrocarbons. Most of the existing numerical approximations for the DVWE are based on domain truncation with ad hoc boundary conditions. However, this would generate artificial reflections as well as truncation errors. To this end, we directly consider the DVWE in unbounded domains. We first show the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of the solution of the DVWE. We then develop a Hermite spectral Galerkin scheme and derive the corresponding error estimate showing that the Hermite spectral Galerkin approximation delivers a spectral rate of convergence provided sufficiently smooth solutions. Several numerical experiments with constant and discontinuous coefficients are provided to verify the theoretical result and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, We verify the error estimate for both smooth and non-smooth source terms and initial conditions. In view of the error estimate and the regularity result, we show the sharpness of the convergence rate in terms of the regularity of the source term. We also show that the artificial reflection does not occur by using the present method.",

We verify the accuracy order of ResNet ODE solver matches the accuracy order of the data. Forward Euler, Runge–Kutta2 and Runge–Kutta4 finite difference schemes are adapted generating three learning data sets, which are applied to train three ResNet ODE solvers independently. The well trained ResNet solvers obtain 2nd, 3rd and 5th orders of one step errors and behave just as its counterpart finite difference method for linear and nonlinear ODEs with regular solutions. In particular, we carry out (1) architecture study in terms of number of hidden layers and neurons per layer to obtain optimal network structure; (2) target study to verify the ResNet solver is as accurate as its finite difference method counterpart; (3) solution trajectory simulations. A sequence of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and capability of ResNet solver.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a new Cartesian grid finite difference scheme is introduced for solving parabolic initial-boundary value problems involving irregular domains and Robin boundary condition in two and three dimensions. In spatial discretization, a ray-casting matched interface and boundary (MIB) method is utilized to enforce different types of boundary conditions, including Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and their mixed combinations, along the normal direction to generate necessary fictitious values outside the irregular domain. This allows accurate approximations of jumps in derivatives at various boundary locations so that the fourth-order central difference can be corrected at all Cartesian nodes. By treating such corrections as additional unknowns, the order of finite difference discretization of the Laplacian operator can be preserved. Moreover, by constructing corrections for different types of irregular and corner points, the proposed augmented MIB (AMIB) method can accommodate complicated geometries, while maintaining the fourth order of accuracy in space. In temporal discretization, the standard Crank–Nicolson scheme is employed, which is second-order in time and unconditionally stable. Furthermore, a Fast Sine Transform acceleration algorithm is employed to efficiently invert the discrete Laplacian, so that the augmented linear system in each time step can be solved with a complexity of \n                      \n                      \\(O(N \\log N)\\)\n                      \n                    , where N stands for the total spatial degree-of-freedom. The accuracy, stability and efficiency of the proposed AMIB method are numerically validated by considering various parabolic problems in two and three dimensions.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a new well-balanced discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is proposed for the shallow water equations in the sense of moving-water equilibria preservation. The significant ingredient for the scheme is the approximation of the equilibrium variables in the DG piecewise polynomial space, rather than the conservative variables in most existing well-balanced schemes. Thus, the conservative variables are non-polynomial functions of the equilibrium variables. This approach is easily accomplished without the reference equilibrium state recovery and a special source term approximation. To obtain the moving water equilibrium preservation of the scheme, the strategy pursued is to modify the numerical fluxes based on the generalized hydrostatic reconstruction. A rigorous theoretical analysis proves the exact equilibrium preservation of the scheme. Numerical tests demonstrate that this DG method is high-order accurate, successfully maintains the still water and the generalized moving water equilibria states, and captures small perturbations of the hydrostatic state without numerical oscillations near shocks even on the discontinuous bottom topography.",

For this purpose, two types single-parameter bases that automatically meet the boundary conditions are deduced, namely the first and second bases satisfying boundary conditions method (BSBCM). We solve a linear algebraic equations system which satisfies the over-specified Neumann boundary condition to obtain the unspecified coefficients, and then the solution in the entire domain is permitted. Taking the solution into the governing equation, the unknown source and coefficient functions can be determined quickly. We also develop linear system methods to identify the coefficient and conductivity functions. It is remarkable that we do not need extra boundary data of the conductivity function to resolve the inverse conductivity problem. The present novel methods are verified to be accurate, effective, and robust, which are without solving nonlinear equations and executing iterations, and additional data used are quite economical.",

Based on our numerical results, DQ ROM errors are several orders of magnitude smaller than noDQ ones (in which the POD is constructed in a standard way, i.e., without the DQ approach) in terms of the energy kept by the ROM basis. Further, noDQ ROM errors have an optimal behavior, while DQ ROM errors, where the DQ is added to the POD process, demonstrate an optimality/super-optimality behavior. It is conjectured that this possibly occurs because the DQ inner products allow the time dependency in the ROM spaces to make an impact.",

In this paper, we propose and validate a multiscale model for the description of particle diffusion in presence of trapping boundaries. We start from a drift-diffusion equation in which the drift term describes the effect of bubble traps and is modeled by a short-range potential with an attractive term and a repulsive core. The interaction of the particles attracted by the bubble surface is simulated by the Lennard–Jones potential that simplifies the capture due to the hydrophobic properties of the ions. In our model, the effect of the potential is replaced by a suitable boundary condition derived by mass conservation and asymptotic analysis. The potential is assumed to have a range of small size [math]. An asymptotic expansion in the [math] is considered, and the boundary conditions are obtained by retaining the lowest-order terms in the expansion. Another aspect we investigate is the saturation effect coming from high concentrations in the proximity of the bubble surface. The validity of the model is carefully checked with several tests in one and two dimensions and different geometries.",

This paper is concerned with the inverse elastic scattering problem for a random potential in three dimensions. Interpreted as a distribution, the potential is assumed to be a microlocally isotropic Gaussian random field whose covariance operator is a classical pseudodifferential operator. Given the potential, the direct scattering problem is shown to be well-posed in the sense of distributions by studying the equivalent Lippmann–Schwinger integral equation. For the inverse scattering problem, we demonstrate that the microlocal strength of the random potential can be uniquely determined with probability one by a single realization of the high frequency limit of the averaged compressional or shear backscattered far-field pattern of the scattered wave. The analysis employs the integral operator theory, the Born approximation in the high frequency regime, the microlocal analysis for the Fourier integral operators, and the ergodicity of the wave field.",

In this paper, we present theoretical studies on the time averaging of a reduced model for wetting on rough surfaces and also the analysis on the effect of stochastic thermal forces. We derive equations for the averaged dynamics and show that the apparent contact angle depends on the harmonic averaging of the geometric and chemical properties of the substrates as well as the contact line velocity.

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Volume 83, Issue 2, Page 374-393, April 2023. \n Abstract. Understanding the properties of charge dynamics is crucial to many practical applications, such as electrochemical energy devices and transmembrane ion channels. This work proposes a Maxwell–Ampère Nernst–Planck (MANP) framework for the description of charge dynamics. The MANP model with a curl-free condition on the electric displacement is shown to be energy dissipative with respect to a convex free-energy functional, and demonstrated to be equivalent to the Poisson–Nernst–Planck model. By the energy dissipation law, the steady state of the MANP model reproduces the charge conserving Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) theory, providing an alternative energy stable approach to study the PB theory. In order to achieve the curl-free condition, a companion local curl-free relaxation algorithm, which is shown to naturally preserve the discrete Gauss’s law and converge robustly with linear computational complexity, is developed for the MANP model. One of the main advantages of our development is that it can efficiently deal with space-dependent permittivity instead of solving the variable-coefficient Poisson’s equation. Many-body effects such as ionic steric effects and Coulomb correlations can be incorporated within the MANP framework to derive modified MANP models for problems in which the mean-field approximation fails. Numerical results on the charge dynamics with such beyond mean-field effects in inhomogeneous dielectric environments are presented to demonstrate the performance of the MANP models in the description of charge dynamics, illustrating that the proposed MANP model provides a general framework for modeling charge dynamics.",
