          "description": "Abstract\nWe present an entropy stable nodal discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) for the two-layer shallow water equations on two dimensional curvilinear meshes. We mimic the continuous entropy analysis on the semi-discrete level with the DGSEM constructed on Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto (LGL) nodes. The use of LGL nodes endows the collocated nodal DGSEM with the summation-by-parts property that is key in the discrete analysis. The approximation exploits an equivalent flux differencing formulation for the volume contributions, which generate an entropy conservative split-form of the governing equations. A specific combination of a numerical surface flux and discretization of the nonconservative terms is then applied to obtain a high-order path-conservative scheme that is entropy conservative. Furthermore, we find that this combination yields an analogous discretization for the pressure and nonconservative terms such that the numerical method is well-balanced for discontinuous bathymetry on curvilinear domains. Dissipation is added at the interfaces to create an entropy stable approximation that satisfies the second law of thermodynamics in the discrete case, while maintaining the well-balanced property. We conclude with verification of the theoretical findings through numerical tests and demonstrate results about convergence, entropy stability and well-balancedness of the scheme.",

Three different kinds of configurations are considered where the cavities are distributed only in the meso-scale, micro-scale, and both-scale representative cells respectively. Firstly, the second-order two-scale asymptotic expansion is performed between the macroscopic and the mesoscopic scale. Then, the second-order two-scale analysis is further developed on the mesoscopic cell functions at the microscopic level. While the asymptotic expansions of the first-order mesoscopic cell functions are similar for the three cases, the expansions of the second-order mesoscopic cell functions a…",

Thus the wavenumber is modeled as a random variable or a random field. We discretize the Helmholtz equation using finite differences in space, which leads to a linear system of algebraic equations including random variables. A stochastic Galerkin method yields a deterministic linear system of algebraic equations. This linear system is high-dimensional, sparse and complex symmetric but, in general, not hermitian. We therefore solve this system iteratively with GMRES and propose two preconditioners: a complex shifted Laplace preconditioner and a mean value preconditioner. Both preconditioners reduce the number of iteration steps as well as the computation time in our numerical experiments.",

To this end, two new techniques are developed. (i) A three-part decomposition of the L1 discretization for Caputo derivatives is proposed and justified for fast evaluation while maintaining positivity; (ii) A positivity-correction technique is devised for both diffusive and convective fluxes. An upwinding technique for the bilinear finite volume approximation on general quadrilaterals is utilized for enabling the solver robustness in handling convection dominance. The solver attains optimal convergence rates when graded temporal meshes are used. These properties are theoretically justified and numerically illustrated.",

After setting the related systems of partial differential equations equipped with proper boundary conditions, we provide its finite element discretization and focus on the resulting large linear systems. We first give a relatively complete spectral analysis using tools from the theory of Generalized Locally Toeplitz matrix sequences. The obtained spectral information is used for designing appropriate preconditioned Krylov solvers. Through numerical experiments, we show that the presented solution strategy is robust w.r.t. problem and discretization parameters, efficient and scalable.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe reconstruction of images from measured data is an increasing field of research. For highly under-determined problems, template-based image reconstruction provides a way of compensating for the lack of sufficient data. A caveat of this approach is that dealing with different topologies of the template and the target image is challenging. In this paper, we propose a LDDMM-based image-reconstruction model that resolves this issue by adding a source term. On the theoretical side, we show that the model satisfies all criteria for being a well-posed regularization method. For the implementation, we pursue a discretize-then-optimize approach involving the proximal alternating linearized minimization algorithm, which is known to converge under mild assumptions. Our simulations with both artificial and real data confirm the robustness of the method, and its ability to successfully deal with topology changes even if the available amount of data is very limited.",

In this paper we investigate the possibility of exploiting mixed precision computing in LSQR for solving discrete linear ill-posed problems. Based on the commonly used regularization model for linear inverse problems, we analyze the choice of proper computing precision in the two main parts of LSQR, including the construction of Krylov subspace and updating procedure of iterative solutions. We show that, under some mild conditions, the Lanczos vectors can be computed using single precision without loss of any accuracy of the final regularized solution as long as the noise level is not extremely small. We also show that the most time consuming part for updating iterative solutions can be performed using single precision without sacrificing any accuracy. The results indicate that several highly time consuming parts of the algorithm can be implemented using lower precisions, and provide a theoretical guideline for implementing a robust and efficient mixed precision variant of LSQR for solving discrete linear ill-posed problems. Numerical experiments are made to test two mixed precision variants of LSQR and confirming our results.",

In this work, we consider a nonlinear strain-limiting elastic model in heterogeneous domains. We investigate heterogeneous material with soft and stiff inclusions and perforations that are important to understand an elastic solid’s behavior and crack-tip fields. Numerical solutions of problems in computational domains with inclusions and perforations require the construction of a sufficiently fine grid that resolves heterogeneity on the grid level. Approximations on such grids lead to a large system of equations with large computational costs. To reduce the size of the system and provide an accurate solution, we present a generalized multiscale finite element approximation on the coarse grid. In this method, we construct multiscale basis functions in each local domain associated with the coarse-grid cell and based on the construction of the snapshot space and solution of the local spectral problem reduce the size of the snapshot space. Two types of multiscale basis function construction are presented. The first type is a general case that can handle any boundary conditions on the global boundary of the heterogeneous domain. The considered problem requires an accurate approximation of the crack-surface boundary. In the second type of multiscale basis functions, we incorporate global boundary conditions in the basis construction process which provide an accurate approximation of the stress and strain on the crack boundary. We present numerical results for three cases of heterogeneity: soft inclusions, stiff inclusions, and perforations. A numerical investigation is presented for the two examples of loading on the domain with and without crack boundary conditions. The presented generalized multiscale finite element solver provides an accurate solution with a large reduction of the discrete system size. Our results illustrate the significant error reduction on the crack surface when we use the second type of basis functions.",

We propose a scheme for data-driven parameterization of unresolved dimensions of dynamical systems based on the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and Koopman operator theory. Given a system in which some components of the state are unknown, this method involves defining a surrogate system in a time-dependent quantum state which determines the fluxes from the unresolved degrees of freedom at each timestep. The quantum state is a density operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space of classical observables and evolves over time under an action induced by the Koopman operator. The quantum state also updates with new values of the resolved variables according to a quantum Bayes’ law, implemented via an operator-valued feature map. Kernel methods are utilized to learn data-driven basis functions and represent quantum states, observables, and evolution operators as matrices. The resulting computational schemes are automatically positivity-preserving, aiding in the physical consistency of the parameterized system. We analyze the results of two different modalities of this methodology applied to the Lorenz 63 and Lorenz 96 multiscale systems and show how this approach preserves important statistical and qualitative properties of the underlying chaotic dynamics.",

A generalized finite element method (FEM) is proposed for solving a heterogeneous reaction-diffusion equation with a singular perturbation parameter [math], based on locally approximating the solution on each subdomain by solution of a local reaction-diffusion equation and eigenfunctions of a local eigenproblem. These local problems are posed on some domains slightly larger than the subdomains with oversampling size [math]. The method is formulated at the continuous level as a direct discretization of the continuous problem and at the discrete level as a coarse-space approximation for its standard finite element (FE) discretizations. Exponential decay rates for local approximation errors with respect to [math] and [math] (at the discrete level with [math] denoting the fine FE mesh size) and with the local degrees of freedom are established. In particular, it is shown that the method at the continuous level converges uniformly with respect to [math] in the standard [math] norm, and that if the oversampling size is relatively large with respect to [math] and [math] (at the discrete level), the solutions of the local reaction-diffusion equations provide good local approximations for the solution and thus the local eigenfunctions are not needed.

Traditionally, sea ice has been modeled as a continuum under Eulerian coordinates to describe its large-scale features, using, for instance, viscous-plastic rheology. Recently, Lagrangian particle models, also known as the discrete element method models, have been utilized for characterizing the motion of individual sea ice fragments (called floes) at scales of 10 km and smaller, especially in marginal ice zones. This paper develops a multiscale model that couples the particle and the continuum systems to facilitate an effective representation of the dynamical and statistical features of sea ice across different scales. The multiscale model exploits a Boltzmann-type system that links the particle movement with the continuum equations. For the small-scale dynamics, it describes the motion of each sea ice floe. Then, as the large-scale continuum component, it treats the statistical moments of mass density and linear and angular velocities. The evolution of these statistics affects the motion of individual floes, which in turn provides bulk feedback that adjusts the large-scale dynamics. Notably, the particle model characterizing the sea ice floes is localized and fully parallelized in a framework that is sometimes called superparameterization, which significantly improves computational efficiency. Numerical examples demonstrate the effective performance of the multiscale model. Additionally, the study demonstrates that the multiscale model has a linear-order approximation to the truth model.",

We previously showed that three-dimensional quadratic diffeomorphisms have anti-integrable (AI) limits that correspond to a quadratic correspondence, a pair of one-dimensional maps. At the AI limit the dynamics is conjugate to a full shift on two symbols. Here we consider a more general AI limit, allowing two parameters of the map to go to infinity. We prove the existence of AI states for each symbol sequence for three cases of the quadratic correspondence: parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas. A contraction argument gives parameter domains such that this is a bijection, but the correspondence also is observed to apply more generally. We show that orbits of the original map can be obtained by numerical continuation for a volume-contracting case. These results show that periodic AI states evolve into the observed periodic attractors of the diffeomorphism. We also continue a periodic AI state with a symbol sequence chosen so that it continues to an orbit resembling a chaotic attractor that is a 3D version of the classical 2D Hénon attractor.",

Perhaps more importantly, we provide the first numerical calculations of scattering phases for nonradial scatterers.

To overcome some limits of classical neuronal models, we propose a Markovian generalization of the classical model based on Jacobi processes by introducing downwards jumps to describe the activity of a single neuron. The statistical analysis of interspike intervals is performed by studying the first passage times of the proposed Markovian Jacobi process with jumps through a constant boundary. In particular, we characterize its Laplace transform, which is expressed in terms of some generalization of hypergeometric functions that we introduce, and deduce a closed-form expression for its expectation. Our approach, which is original in the context of first-passage-time problems, relies on intertwining relations between the semigroups of the classical Jacobi process and its generalization, which have been recently established in [P.

We develop the steady-state regularized 13-moment equations in the linear regime for rarefied gas dynamics with general collision models. For small Knudsen numbers, the model is accurate up to the super-Burnett order, and the resulting system of moment equations is shown to have a symmetric structure. We also propose Onsager boundary conditions for the moment equations that guarantee the stability of the equations. The validity of our model is verified by benchmark examples for the one-dimensional channel flows.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Volume 84, Issue 1, Page 165-188, February 2024. \n Abstract. We consider the problem of elastic diffraction tomography, which consists in reconstructing elastic properties (i.e., mass density and elastic Lamé parameters) of a weakly scattering medium from full-field data of scattered waves outside the medium. Elastic diffraction tomography refers to the elastic inverse scattering problem after linearization using a first-order Born approximation. In this paper, we prove the Fourier diffraction theorem, which relates the two-dimensional Fourier transform of scattered waves with the Fourier transform of the scatterer in the three-dimensional spatial Fourier domain. Elastic wave mode separation is performed, which decomposes a wave into five modes. A new two-step inversion process is developed, providing information on the modes first and second on the elastic parameters. Finally, we discuss reconstructions with plane wave excitation experiments for different tomographic setups and with different plane wave excitation frequencies, respectively.",

The mechanism of seed dispersal mutualism is fundamental to understanding vegetation diversity and its conservation. In this study, we propose a stochastic model that extends the classical framework of seed dispersal mutualism to explore the effects of environmental stochasticity on mutualistic interactions between seed dispersers and plants. We first provide a comprehensive picture of the long-term dynamics of seed dispersal mutualism in deterministic and stochastic environments. We then analyze the relationship between stochasticity and the probability and time that seed dispersal mutualism tips between stable states. Additionally, we evaluate the extinction risk of seed dispersal mutualism for different population values and accordingly assign extinction warning levels to these values. The analysis reveals that the impact of environmental stochasticity on tipping phenomena is scenario-dependent but follows some interpretable trends. The probability (resp., time) of tipping towards the extinction state typically increases (resp., decreases) monotonically with noise intensity, while the probability of tipping towards the coexistence state typically peaks at intermediate noise intensity. Noise in animal populations contributes to tipping toward the coexistence state, whereas noise in plant populations slows down the tipping toward the coexistence state. Noise-induced changes in warning levels of initial population values are most pronounced near the boundaries of the basin of attraction, but sufficiently loud noise (especially for plant populations) may alter the risk far from these boundaries. These findings provide a theoretical explanation for the effect of environmental stochasticity on multistability transitions in seed dispersal mutualism and can be utilized to study the interplay between other population systems and environmental stochasticity.",

Starting from a nonlocal version of the Prigogine–Herman traffic model, we derive a natural hierarchy of kinetic discrete-velocity models for traffic flow consisting of systems of quasi-linear hyperbolic equations with relaxation terms. The hyperbolic main part of these models turns out to have several favorable features. In particular, we determine Riemann invariants and prove richness and total linear degeneracy of the hyperbolic systems. Moreover, a physically reasonable invariant domain is obtained for all equations of the hierarchy. Additionally, we investigate the full relaxation system with respect to stability and persistence of periodic (stop-and-go-type) solutions and derive a condition for the appearance of such solutions. Finally, numerical results for various situations are presented, illustrating the analytical findings.",
