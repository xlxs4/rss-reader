Under this approach and with the aid of the theory of compact operators, we prove convergence for the proposed VEM and error estimates. We report a series of numerical tests in order to assess the performance of the method where we analyze the effects of the Poisson ratio on the computation of the order of convergence, together with the effects of the stabilization term on the arising of spurious eigenvalues.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we investigate inverse obstacle scattering problems in acoustic waveguides with low-frequency data. A Bayesian inference scheme, combining a multi-fidelity strategy and surrogate model with guided modes and a deep neural network is proposed to reconstruct the shapes of unknown scattering objects. First, the inverse problem is reformulated as a statistical inference problem using Bayes’ formula, which provides statistical characteristics of the posterior distribution and quantification of the uncertainties. The well-posedness of the posterior distribution is proved by using the f-divergence. Subsequently, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is used to explore the posterior density. We propose a new multi-fidelity surrogate model to accelerate the sampling procedure while maintaining high accuracy. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that this method not only produces high-quality reconstructions but also substantially reduces computational costs.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose a nonconvex and nonsmooth image prior based on the hyperbolic tangent function and apply it as a regularization term for image restoration and reconstruction problems. Theoretically, we analyze the properties of the function and the minimizers of its associated proximal problem. Since the proximal problem has no closed-form solution, we propose a derivative-free Nelder-Mead simplex based selection algorithm to find the global minimizer. To reduce the computational cost, we only solve a small 1D problem and then use the 1D solution template as a look-up table to interpolate high-dimension data. Moreover, we consider a variational model based on the proposed image prior. Then we use the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm on the nonconvex model to derive efficient numerical algorithms. Various experiments on image denoising, image deblurring, and image reconstruction demonstrate that the proposed nonconvex prior is competitive with the existing priors. In particular, it outperforms others in recovering piecewise constant images.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe present a framework for the structure-preserving approximation of partial differential equations on mapped multipatch domains, extending the classical theory of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) to discrete de Rham sequences which are broken, i.e., fully discontinuous across the patch interfaces. Following the Conforming/Nonconforming Galerkin (CONGA) schemes developed in Campos Pinto and Sonnendrücker (Math Comput 85:2651–2685, 2016) and Campos Pinto and Güçlü (Broken-FEEC discretizations and Hodge Laplace problems. arXiv:2109.02553, 2022), our approach is based on: (i) the identification of a conforming discrete de Rham sequence with stable commuting projection operators, (ii) the relaxation of the continuity constraints between patches, and (iii) the construction of conforming projections mapping back to the conforming subspaces, allowing to define discrete differentials on the broken sequence. This framework combines the advantages of conforming FEEC discretizations (e.g. commuting projections, discrete duality and Hodge–Helmholtz decompositions) with the data locality and implementation simplicity of interior penalty methods for discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. We apply it to several initial- and boundary-value problems, as well as eigenvalue problems arising in electromagnetics. In each case our formulations are shown to be well posed thanks to an appropriate stabilization of the jumps across the interfaces, and the solutions are extremely robust with respect to the stabilization parameter. Finally we describe a construction using tensor-product splines on mapped cartesian patches, and we detail the associated matrix operators. Our numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and stability of this discrete framework, and they allow us to verify that expected structure-preserving properties such as divergence or harmonic constraints are respected to floating-point accuracy.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe present an efficient a posteriori error control strategy for an energy-based concurrent multiscale method with sharp interface in molecular mechanics, namely the geometric reconstruction based atomistic/continuum coupling method (GRAC). For the problem of the adaptive simulation of a range of crystal defects with practical importance, we develop an adaptive algorithm for the GRAC method based on a theory based modification of the residual based a posteriori error estimator and a specially designed mesh structure. In particular, by exploiting the decay of the displacement of the crystal caused by the defects, we are able to prove that the numerically expensive modeling residual estimator, which often exists in concurrent multiscale schemes, can be appropriately approximated by the inexpensive coarsening residual estimator in certain region which results in a significantly improvement of the efficiency of the adaptivity. The numerical experiments show that our adaptive strategy based on the modified error estimator and special mesh structure with properly chosen parameters leads to the same optimal convergence rate of the error but reduces the computational cost measured in CPU times by one order with respect to the number of degrees of freedom compared with that based on the original residual based error estimator.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe present an hp-adaptive discretization for a sharp interface model with a level-set ghost-fluid method to simulate compressible multiphase flows. The scheme applies an efficient p-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin (DG) operator in regions of smooth flow. Shocks and the phase interface are captured by a Finite Volume (FV) scheme on a h-refined element-local sub-grid. The resulting hp-adaptive scheme thus combines both the high order accuracy of the DG method and the robustness of the FV scheme by using p-adaptation in smooth areas and h-refinement at discontinuities, respectively. For the level-set based interface tracking, a similar hybrid DG/FV operator is employed. Both p-refinement and FV shock and interface capturing are performed at runtime and controlled by an indicator, which is based on the modal decay of the solution polynomials. In parallel simulations, the hp-adaptive discretization together with the costly interface tracking algorithm cause a significant imbalance in the processor workloads. To ensure parallel efficiency, we propose a dynamic load balancing scheme that determines the workload distribution by element-local wall time measurements and redistributes elements along a space filling curve. The parallelization strategy is supported by strong scaling tests using up to 8192 cores. The framework is applied to established benchmarks problems for inviscid, compressible multiphase flows. The results demonstrate that the hybrid adaptive discretization can efficiently and accurately handle complex multiphase flow problems involving pronounced interface deformations and merging interface contours.",
