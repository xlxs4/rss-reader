Unisolvence not only requires that the number of nodes equals the number of independent polynomials spanning a polynomial space of a given degree, but also that the Vandermonde matrix controlling their mapping to the Lagrange interpolating polynomials can be inverted. Here, a necessary condition for unisolvence is presented for polynomial spaces that have non-decreasing degrees when going from the edges and the various faces to the interior of the simplex. It leads to a proof of a conjecture on a necessary condition for unisolvence, requiring the node pattern to be the same as that of the regular simplex.",

The multicomponent composition of the reacting medium and the reactions occurring in it were described by expanding the original system of Euler equations by a system of non-stationary convection–reaction equations. The use of this method to simulate high stiff problems associated with reactions occurring in a multicomponent medium requires the use of the adaptive change in the time step. The solution of the classical problem related to the formation and propagation of a ZND detonation wave is carried out.

For this purpose, two types single-parameter bases that automatically meet the boundary conditions are deduced, namely the first and second bases satisfying boundary conditions method (BSBCM). We solve a linear algebraic equations system which satisfies the over-specified Neumann boundary condition to obtain the unspecified coefficients, and then the solution in the entire domain is permitted. Taking the solution into the governing equation, the unknown source and coefficient functions can be determined quickly. We also develop linear system methods to identify the coefficient and conductivity functions. It is remarkable that we do not need extra boundary data of the conductivity function to resolve the inverse conductivity problem. The present novel methods are verified to be accurate, effective, and robust, which are without solving nonlinear equations and executing iterations, and additional data used are quite economical.",

Further, noDQ ROM errors have an optimal behavior, while DQ ROM errors, where the DQ is added to the POD process, demonstrate an optimality/super-optimality behavior.

We then generalize this energy argument to construct a global projection operator on special simplex meshes in multidimensions satisfying the so-called flow condition.

This method can yield highly accurate solutions to linear/nonlinear PDEs, but requires the last hidden layer of the neural network to be wide to achieve a high accuracy. If the last hidden layer is narrow, the accuracy of the existing ELM method will be poor, irrespective of the rest of the network configuration. In this paper we present a modified ELM method, termed HLConcELM (hidden-layer concatenated ELM), to overcome the above drawback of the conventional ELM method. The HLConcELM method can produce highly accurate solutions to linear/nonlinear PDEs when the last hidden layer of the network is narrow and when it is wide. The new method is based on a type of modified feedforward neural networks (FNN), termed HLConcFNN (hidden-layer concatenated FNN), which incorporates a logical concatenation of the hidden layers in the network and exposes all the hidden nodes to the output-layer nodes. HLConcFNNs have the interesting property that, given a network architecture, when additional hidden layers are appended to the network or when extra nodes are added to the existing hidden layers, the representation capacity of the HLConcFNN associated with the new architecture is guaranteed to be not smaller than that of the original network architecture. Here representation capacity refers to the set of all functions that can be exactly represented by the neural network of a given architecture. We present ample benchmark tests with linear/nonlinear PDEs to demonstrate the computational accuracy and performance of the HLConcELM method and the superiority of this method to the conventional ELM from previous works.",

Tang, PLoS Comput. Biol., 14 (2018), e1006178]. This stability analysis considers small perturbations of the density and chemical concentration around two nontrivial steady states, and the linearized equations are transformed into a generalized eigenvalue problem. By formal analysis, when the internal variable responds to the outside signal fast enough, the PBDM converges to an anisotropic diffusion model, for which the probability density distribution in the internal variable becomes a delta function. We introduce an asymptotic preserving (AP) scheme for the PBDM that converges to a stable limit scheme consistent with the anisotropic diffusion model. Further numerical simulations demonstrate the theoretical results of linear stability analysis, i.e., the pattern formation, and the convergence of the AP scheme.",

We derive the PDE governing the hydrodynamic limit of a Metropolis rate crystal surface height process in the “rough scaling” regime introduced by Marzuola and Weare. The PDE takes the form of a continuity equation, and the expression for the current involves a numerically computed multiplicative correction term similar to a mobility. The correction accounts for the fact that, unusually, the local equilibrium distribution of the process is not a local Gibbs measure even though the global equilibrium distribution is Gibbs. We give definitive numerical evidence of this fact, originally suggested by Y. Gao, A. E. Katsevich, J.-G. Liu, J. Lu, and J. L. Marzuola [Pure Appl. Anal., 3 (2021), pp. 595–612]. In that paper, an approximate PDE—our PDE, but without the correction term—was derived for the limit of the Metropolis rate process under the assumption of a local Gibbs distribution. Our main contribution is to present a numerical method to compute the corrected macroscopic current, which is given by a function of the third spatial derivative of the height profile. Our method exploits properties of the local equilibrium (LE) state of the third order finite difference process. We find that the LE state of this process is not only useful for deriving the PDE, it also enjoys nonstandard properties which are interesting in their own right. Namely, we demonstrate that the LE state is a “rough LE,” a novel kind of LE state discovered in our recent work on an Arrhenius rate crystal surface process.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Volume 83, Issue 2, Page 374-393, April 2023. \n Abstract. Understanding the properties of charge dynamics is crucial to many practical applications, such as electrochemical energy devices and transmembrane ion channels. This work proposes a Maxwell–Ampère Nernst–Planck (MANP) framework for the description of charge dynamics. The MANP model with a curl-free condition on the electric displacement is shown to be energy dissipative with respect to a convex free-energy functional, and demonstrated to be equivalent to the Poisson–Nernst–Planck model. By the energy dissipation law, the steady state of the MANP model reproduces the charge conserving Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) theory, providing an alternative energy stable approach to study the PB theory. In order to achieve the curl-free condition, a companion local curl-free relaxation algorithm, which is shown to naturally preserve the discrete Gauss’s law and converge robustly with linear computational complexity, is developed for the MANP model. One of the main advantages of our development is that it can efficiently deal with space-dependent permittivity instead of solving the variable-coefficient Poisson’s equation. Many-body effects such as ionic steric effects and Coulomb correlations can be incorporated within the MANP framework to derive modified MANP models for problems in which the mean-field approximation fails. Numerical results on the charge dynamics with such beyond mean-field effects in inhomogeneous dielectric environments are presented to demonstrate the performance of the MANP models in the description of charge dynamics, illustrating that the proposed MANP model provides a general framework for modeling charge dynamics.",

This article considers the minimization of the total number of infected individuals over the course of an epidemic in which the rate of infectious contacts can be reduced by time-dependent nonpharmaceutical interventions. The societal and economic costs of interventions are taken into account using a linear budget constraint which imposes a trade-off between short-term heavy interventions and long-term light interventions. We search for an optimal intervention strategy in an infinite-dimensional space of controls containing multiple consecutive lockdowns, gradually imposed and lifted restrictions, and various heuristic controls based, for example, on tracking the effective reproduction number. Mathematical analysis shows that among all such strategies, the global optimum is achieved by a single constant-level lockdown of maximum possible magnitude. Numerical simulations highlight the need for careful timing of such interventions and illustrate their benefits and disadvantages compared to strategies designed for minimizing peak prevalence. Rather counterintuitively, adding restrictions prior to the start of a well-planned intervention strategy may even increase the total incidence.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Volume 83, Issue 2, Page 329-353, April 2023. \n Abstract. We present an analytical approach to the problem of predicting the finger width of a simple fluid driving a non-Newtonian (power-law) fluid. Our analysis is based on the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation, by representing the deviation from the Newtonian viscosity as a singular perturbation in a parameter, leading to a solvability condition at the finger tip, which selects a unique finger width from the family of solutions. We find that the relation between the dimensionless finger width, [math], and the dimensionless group of parameters containing the viscosity and surface tension, [math], has the form [math] for the shear thinning case and [math] for the shear thickening case, in the limit of small [math]. This theoretical estimate is compared with the existing experimental, finger width data as well as the one computed with the linearized model, and a good agreement is found near the power-law exponent, [math].",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 52, Issue 2, Page 358-411, April 2023. \n Abstract. A team of mobile agents with different labels, starting from different nodes of an unknown anonymous network, must meet at the same node and declare that they all met. This task of gathering was traditionally considered assuming that agents at the same node can exchange information. We ask if this ability of talking is needed. The answer turns out to be no. We design two deterministic algorithms that accomplish gathering in a much weaker model. We only assume that each agent knows how many agents are at the node that it currently occupies. Our first algorithm assumes that agents know some upper bound N on the size of the network, and works in time polynomial in N and in the length [math] of the smallest label. Our second algorithm does not assume any knowledge about the network, but its complexity is at least exponential in the size of the network and in the labels of agents. Its purpose is to show feasibility of gathering under this harsher scenario. As a by-product we solve, in the same weak model, the fundamental problem of leader election among agents. As an application we solve the gossiping problem in this model: if each agent has a message, all agents can learn all messages. This is perhaps our most surprising finding: agents without any transmitting devices can solve the most general information exchange problem if they can count the number of agents present at visited nodes.",
