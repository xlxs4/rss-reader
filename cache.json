          "description": "Dance-based therapies are an emerging form of movement therapy aiming to improve motor and cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairments (MCIs). Despite promising effects of dance-based therapy on function, it remains unclear how age-related declines in motor and cognitive function influence which movements and rhythms maximize dance therapy efficacy. Here, we evaluated the effects of age and MCI on the ability to accurately modulate spatial (i.e., joint kinematics), temporal (i.e., step timing), and spatiotemporal features of gait to achieve spatial and temporal targets during walking. We developed novel rhythmic movement sequences - nine spatial, nine temporal, and four spatiotemporal - that deviated from typical spatial and temporal features of walking. Healthy young adults (HYA), healthy older adults (HOA), and adults with MCI were trained on each gait modification before performing the modification overground, with kinematic data recorded using wearable sensors. HOA performed spatial (p = 0.010) and spatiotemporal (p = 0.048) gait modifications less accurately than HYA. Individuals with MCI performed spatiotemporal gait modifications less accurately than HOA (p = 0.017). Spatial modifications to the swing phase of gait (p = 0.006, Cohens d = -1.3), and two- and four-step Duple rhythms during temporal modifications (p  0.9) elicited the largest differences in gait performance in HYA vs. HOA and HOA vs. MCI, respectively. These findings suggest that age-related declines in strength and balance reduce the ability to accurately modulate spatial gait features, while declines in working memory in individuals with MCI may reduce the ability to perform longer temporal gait modification sequences. Differences in performance on rhythmic movement sequences highlight the impacts of motor and cognitive deficits on gait modulation capacity, which may assist therapists in personalizing therapies based on these deficits and provide more sensitive indices to track intervention efficacy.",

          "description": "Lactobacilli are gram-positive bacteria that are growing in importance for the healthcare industry and genetically engineering them as living therapeutics is highly sought after. However, progress in this field is hindered since most strains are difficult to genetically manipulate, partly due since their complex and thick cell walls limit our capability to transform them with exogenous DNA. To overcome this, large amounts of DNA (>1 g) are normally required to successfully transform these bacteria. An intermediate host, like E. coli, is often used to amplify recombinant DNA to such amounts although this approach poses unwanted drawbacks such as increase in plasmid size, different methylation patterns and limitation of introducing only genes compatible with the intermediate host. In this work, we have developed a direct cloning method based on Gibson assembly and PCR to amplify the DNA to sufficient quantities for successful transformation in L. plantarum WCFS1. This advantage of this method is demonstrated in terms of shorter experimental duration and the possibility to introduce a gene incompatible with E. coli into L. plantarum WCFS1.",

We systematically characterise the assay protocols for accuracy, sensitivity and simplicity, and describe a novel  ECmax assay that outperforms the others and even enables accurate calibration without requiring the purification of FPs. To obtain cellular protein concentrations, we consider methods for the conversion of optical density to either cell counts or alternatively to cell volumes, as well as examining how cells can interfere with protein counting via fluorescence quenching, which we quantify and correct for the first time. Calibration across different instruments, disparate filter sets and mismatched gains is demonstrated to yield equivalent results. It also reveals that mCherry absorption at 600nm does not confound cell density measurements unless expressed to over 100,000 proteins per cell. FPCountR is presented as pair of open access tools (protocol and R package) to enable the community to use this method, and ultimately to facilitate the quantitative characterisation of synthetic microbial circuits.",

          "description": "Progress in the studies of RNA metabolism and function relies largely on molecular imaging systems, including those comprising a fluorogenic dye and an aptamer-based fluorescence-activating tag. G4 aptamers of Mango family, typically combined with a duplex/hairpin scaffold, activate fluorescence of a green-emitting dye TO1-biotin and hold great promise for intracellular RNA tracking. Here, we report a new Mango-based imaging platform. Its key advantages are tunability of spectral properties and applicability for visualization of small RNA molecules that require minimal tag size. The former advantage is due to an expanded (green-to-red-emitting) palette of TO1-inspired fluorogenic dyes, and the latter is ensured by the truncated duplex scaffold. To illustrate applicability of the improved platform, we tagged Mycobacterium tuberculosis sncRNA with the shortened aptamer-scaffold tag and visualized it in bacteria and bacteria-infected macrophages using the new red light-emitting Mango-activated dye.",

          "description": "Global climate change demands carbon-negative innovations to reduce the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Cyanobacteria can fix CO2 from the atmosphere and can be genetically reprogrammed for the production of biofuels, chemicals and food products, making an ideal microbial chassis for carbon-negative biotechnology. However, the progress seems to be slowed down due to the lagging-behind synthetic biology toolkits, especially the CRISPR-Cas-based genome-editing tools. As such, we developed a base-editing tool based on the CRISPR-Cas system and deamination for cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus. We achieved efficient and precise genome editing at a single-nucleotide resolution, and identified the pure population of edited cells at the first round of selection without extra segregation. By using the base-editing tool, we successfully manipulated the glycogen metabolic pathway via the introduction of premature STOP codons to inactivate the corresponding genes. We demonstrated multiplex base editing by editing two genes at once, obtaining a nearly two-fold increase in the glycogen content. We present here the first report of base editing in the phylum of cyanobacteria, and a paradigm for applying CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria. We believe that this work will accelerate the synthetic biology of cyanobacteria and drive more innovations to alleviate global climate change.",

Here, we develop a modular epigenome editing platform that programmes nine key chromatin modifications - or combinations thereof - to precise loci in living cells. We couple this with single-cell readouts to systematically quantitate the magnitude and heterogeneity of transcriptional responses elicited by each specific chromatin modification. Amongst these, we show installing H3K4me3 at promoters causally instructs transcription activation by hierarchically remodeling the chromatin landscape. We further dissect how DNA sequence motifs influence the transcriptional impact of chromatin marks, identifying switch-like and attenuative effects within distinct cis contexts. Finally, we examine the interplay of combinatorial modifications, revealing co-targeted H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub maximise silencing penetrance across single-cells. Our precision perturbation strategy unveils the causal principles of how chromatin modification(s) influence transcription, and dissects how quantitative responses are calibrated by contextual interactions.",

Plasmids, DNA or in vitro transcribed RNA are often used to validate novel diagnostic workflows, however, they are poorly representative of clinical samples. RNA phage virus-like particles packaged with exogenous RNA have been used in clinical diagnostics as workflow controls, serving as surrogates for infectious viral particles. Comparable controls for DNA viruses are more challenging to produce, with analogous DNA phages being infectious and packaging of DNA within RNA phages requiring complex purification procedures and expensive chemical linkers. We present a simple and inexpensive method to produce MS2 virus-like particles, packaged with DNA, that makes use of affinity chromatography for purification and enzymatic production of exogenous DNA suitable for packaging. The produced virus-like particles were packaged with Hepatitis B Virus DNA and were then quantified using droplet digital PCR and calibrated against the WHO international standard using a commercial assay in an accredited clinical laboratory.",

They facilitate evolutionary innovation by enabling the exploration of different neighborhoods in genotype space. Genotype networks, first suggested by theoretical models, have been empirically confirmed for proteins and RNAs. Comparative studies also support their existence for gene regulatory networks (GRNs), but direct experimental evidence is lacking. Here, we report the construction of three interconnected genotype networks of synthetic GRNs producing three distinct gene expression phenotypes in Escherichia coli. These genotype networks, composed of over twenty different synthetic GRNs, provide robustness in face of mutations while enabling transitions to innovative phenotypes. Through realistic mathematical modeling, we quantify robustness and evolvability for the complete genotype-phenotype map and link these features mechanistically to GRN motifs. Our work thereby exemplifies how GRN evolution along genotype networks might be driving evolutionary innovation.",

Different aneuploid chromosome stoichiometries lead to distinct transcriptomic and phenotypic changes, making it helpful to study aneuploidy in tightly controlled genetic backgrounds. By deploying the engineered SCRaMbLE system to the newly synthesized Sc2.0 megabase chromosome VII (synVII), we constructed a synthetic disomic yeast and screened hundreds of SCRaMbLEd derivatives with diverse chromosomal rearrangements. Phenotypic characterization and multi-omics analysis revealed that fitness defects associated with aneuploidy could be restored by i) removing most of the chromosome content, or ii) modifying specific regions in the duplicated chromosome. These findings indicate that both chromosome copy number and chromosomal regions contribute to the aneuploidy-related phenotypes, and the synthetic yeast resource opens new paradigms in studying aneuploidy.\n\nIn briefUse of SCRaMbLE and newly synthesized Mb-scale Sc2.0 chromosome VII enables insights into genotype/phenotype relationships associated with aneuploidy\n\nHighlightsO_LIDe novo design and synthesis of a Mb-scale synthetic yeast chromosome VII, carrying 11.8% sequence modifications and representing nearly 10% of the yeast genome.\nC_LIO_LIA disomic yeast (n + synVII) is constructed for dissecting the aneuploidy phenotype\nC_LIO_LISCRaMbLE enables systematic exploration of regions causing aneuploidy phenotypes\nC_LIO_LIChromosomal copy number and content both contribute to aneuploidy phenotypes\nC_LIO_LIA 20 Kb deletion on the right arm of synVII leads to fitness improvement linked to up-regulation of protein synthesis\nC_LI",

          "description": "Gene inactivation is instrumental to study gene function and represents a promising strategy for the treatment of a broad range of diseases. Among traditional technologies, RNA interference suffers from partial target abrogation and requirement for life-long treatments. On the other hand, artificial nucleases can impose stable gene inactivation through induction of DNA Double Strand Breaks, but recent studies are questioning the safety of this approach. Targeted epigenetic editing via Engineered Transcriptional Repressors (ETRs) may represent a solution, as a single administration of specific ETRs combinations can lead to durable silencing without DNA breaks induction. ETRs are proteins containing a programmable DNA Binding Domain (DBD) and effectors from naturally occurring transcriptional repressors. Specifically, a combination of three ETRs equipped with the KRAB domain of human ZNF10, the catalytic domain of human DNMT3A and human DNMT3Lwas shown to induce heritable repressive epigenetic states on the ETR-target gene. The hit-and-run nature of this platform, the lack of impact on the DNA sequence of the target, and the possibility to revert on-demand the repressive state by DNA demethylation, make epigenetic silencing a game-changing tool. A critical step is the identification of the proper position on the target gene where to tether the ETRs in order to maximize on target and minimizing off-target silencing. Performing this step in the final ex vivo or in vivo preclinical setting can be cumbersome. Taking CRISPR-Cas9 system as a paradigmatic DBD for ETRs, here we describe a protocol consisting in the in vitro screen of gRNAs coupled to the triple ETRs combination for efficient on-target silencing, followed by evaluation of the genome-wide specificity profile of top hits. This allows to reduce the initial repertoire of candidate gRNAs to a short list of promising ones, whose complexity is suitable for their final evaluation in the therapeutically relevant setting of interest.",

          "description": "The biomedical research community is investing heavily in biomedical cloud platforms. Cloud computing holds great promise for addressing challenges with big data and ensuring reproducibility in biology. However, despite their advantages, cloud platforms in and of themselves do not automatically support FAIRness. The global push to develop biomedical cloud platforms has led to new challenges, including platform lock-in, difficulty integrating across platforms, and duplicated effort for both users and developers. Here, we argue that these difficulties are systemic and emerge from incentives that encourage development effort on self-sufficient platforms and data repositories instead of interoperable microservices. We argue that many of these issues would be alleviated by prioritizing microservices and access to modular data in smaller chunks or summarized form. We propose that emphasizing modularity and interoperability would lead to a more powerful Unix-like ecosystem of web services for biomedical analysis and data retrieval. We challenge funders, developers, and researchers to support a vision to improve interoperability through microservices as the next generation of cloud-based bioinformatics.",

Elizabeth Parks and colleagues from the University of Missouri, Columbia, USA, discuss the ways in which researchers use stable isotope labeling to monitor the kinetics of fatty acids and other lipids in the body. Usually, lipid quantities are measured only at a single timepoint, however the tracking of lipid turnover over time provides further diagnostic information. Aided by new techniques such as high-throughput mass spectrometry and machine learning, researchers are now able to continuously map total lipid contents in individual patients. The transition of measurements of lipid flux from the research laboratory to the doctor’s office will likely play a role in a new era of precision medicine.",

We show that this system exhibits strange spiral attractors (Shilnikov attractors) with two zero (indistinguishable from zero in numerics) Lyapunov exponents in a wide region of the parameter space. We explain this phenomenon by means of bifurcation analysis of a three-dimensional Poincaré map for the system under consideration. We show that chaotic dynamics develop here near a codimension three bifurcation, when a periodic orbit (fixed point of the Poincaré map) has the triplet of multipliers [math]. As it is known, the flow normal form for such bifurcation is the well-known three-dimensional Arneodó–Coullet–Spiegel–Tresser (ACST) system, which exhibits spiral attractors. According to this, we conclude that the additional zero Lyapunov exponent for orbits in the observed attractors appears due to the fact that the corresponding three-dimensional Poincaré map is very close to the time-shift map of the ACST-system.",

Therefore, we describe an alternative method based on persistent homology—a tool from topological data analysis—that utilizes Betti numbers and CROCKER plots. Betti numbers are topological invariants of topological spaces, while the CROCKER plot is a coarsened but easy to visualize data representation of a one-parameter varying family of persistence barcodes. The specific bifurcations we investigate are transitions from periodic to chaotic behavior or vice versa in a one-parameter collection of differential equations. We validate our methods using numerical experiments on ten dynamical systems and contrast the results with existing tools that use the maximum Lyapunov exponent. We further prove the relationship between the Wasserstein distance to the empty diagram and the norm of the Betti vector, which shows that an even more simplified version of the information has the potential to provide insight into the bifurcation parameter. The results show that our approach reveals more information about the shape of the periodic attractor than standard tools, and it has more favorable computational time in comparison with the Rösenstein algorithm for computing the maximum Lyapunov exponent.",

However, the input of the emotion recognition model is often a whole set of EEG channels obtained by electrodes placed on subjects. The unnecessary information produced by redundant channels affects the recognition rate and depletes computing resources, thereby hindering the practical applications of emotion recognition. In this work, we aim to optimize the input of EEG channels using a visibility graph (VG) and genetic algorithm-based convolutional neural network (GA-CNN). First, we design an experiment to evoke three types of emotion states using movies and collect the multi-channel EEG signals of each subject under different emotion states. Then, we construct VGs for each EEG channel and derive nonlinear features representing each EEG channel. We employ the genetic algorithm (GA) to find the optimal subset of EEG channels for emotion recognition and use the recognition results of the CNN as fitness values. The experimental results show that the recognition performance of the proposed method using a subset of EEG channels is superior to that of the CNN using all channels for each subject. Last, based on the subset of EEG channels searched by the GA-CNN, we perform cross-subject emotion recognition tasks employing leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in recognizing emotion states using fewer EEG channels and further enrich the methods of EEG classification using nonlinear features.",

At first, a new asymmetric branch separates from the fundamental symmetric soliton at the first power critical point, and then, the asymmetric branch passes through the branch of the fundamental symmetric soliton and finally merges into the branch of the fundamental symmetric soliton at the second power critical point, while the power of the soliton increases. This leads to the symmetry breaking and double-loop bifurcation of fundamental symmetric solitons. From the power-propagation constant curves of solitons, symmetric fundamental and tripole solitons, asymmetric solitons can also exist. The stability of symmetric fundamental solitons, asymmetric solitons, and symmetric tripole solitons is discussed by the linear stability analysis and direct simulation. Results indicate that symmetric fundamental solitons and symmetric tripole solitons tend to be stable with the increase in the soliton power. Asymmetric solitons are unstable in both high and low power regions. Moreover, with the increase in saturable nonlinearity, the stability region of fundamental symmetric solitons and symmetric tripole solitons becomes wider.",

This model describes nonparaxial ultrashort pulse propagation in an optical medium in the presence of spatial dispersion originating from the failure of slowly varying envelope approximation. We show that this system admits periodic (elliptic) solitary waves with a dipole structure within a period and also a transition from a dipole to quadrupole structure within a period depending on the value of the modulus parameter of a Jacobi elliptic function. The parametric conditions to be satisfied for the existence of these solutions are given. The effect of the nonparaxial parameter on physical quantities, such as amplitude, pulse width, and speed of the solitary waves, is examined. It is found that by adjusting the nonparaxial parameter, the speed of solitary waves can be decelerated. The stability and robustness of the solitary waves are discussed numerically.",

This aspect has been studied intensively in social dilemmas where competing players’ individual and collective interests are in conflict. Starting from the traditional public goods game model, where players are locally fixed and unconditional cooperators or defectors are present, we introduce two additional strategies through which agents can change their positions of dependence on the local cooperation level. More importantly, these so-called sophisticated players should bear an extra cost to maintain their permanent capacity to evaluate their neighborhood and react accordingly. Hence, four strategies compete, and the most successful one can be imitated by its neighbors. Crucially, the introduction of costly movement has a highly biased consequence on the competing main strategies. In the majority of parameter space, it is harmful to defectors and provides a significantly higher cooperation level when the population is rare. At an intermediate population density, which would be otherwise optimal for a system of immobile players, the presence of mobile actors could be detrimental if the interaction pattern changes slightly, thereby blocking the optimal percolation of information flow. In this parameter space, sophisticated cooperators can also show the co-called Moor effect by first avoiding the harmful vicinity of defectors; they subsequently transform into an immobile cooperator state. Hence, paradoxically, the additional cost of movement could be advantageous to reach a higher general income, especially for a rare population when subgroups would be isolated otherwise.",

However, the symmetries of globally and identically coupled identical units do not allow solutions where distinct oscillators are frequency-unlocked—a necessary condition for the emergence of chimeras. Thus, forced symmetry breaking is necessary to observe chimera-type solutions. Here, we consider the bifurcations that arise when full permutational symmetry is broken for the network to consist of coupled populations. We consider the smallest possible network composed of four phase oscillators and elucidate the phase space structure, (partial) integrability for some parameter values, and how the bifurcations away from full symmetry lead to frequency-unlocked weak chimera solutions. Since such solutions wind around a torus they must arise in a global bifurcation scenario. Moreover, periodic weak chimeras undergo a period-doubling cascade leading to chaos. The resulting chaotic dynamics with distinct frequencies do not rely on amplitude variation and arise in the smallest networks that support chaos.",

To explore neural behaviors and complexity mechanisms in memristive circuits, this paper proposes an N-type locally active memristor, based on which a third-order memristive circuit is constructed. Theoretical analysis shows that the memristive circuit can exhibit not only various action potentials but also self-sustained oscillation and chaos. Based on Chua's theory of local activity, this paper finds that the neural behaviors and chaos emerge near the edge of chaos through subcritical Hopf bifurcation, in which the small unstable limit cycle is depicted by the dividing line between the attraction basin of the large stable limit cycle and the attraction basin of the stable equilibrium point. Furthermore, an analog circuit is designed to imitate the action potentials and chaos, and the simulation results are in agreement with the theoretical analysis.",

We investigate the role of infection fatality ratio (IFR) and social contact matrices on vaccination prioritization using a compartmental epidemic model fueled by real-world data of different diseases and countries. Our study confirms that massive and early vaccination is extremely effective to reduce the disease fatality if the contagion is mitigated, but the effectiveness is increasingly reduced as vaccination beginning delays in an uncontrolled epidemiological scenario. The optimal and least effective prioritization strategies depend non-linearly on epidemiological variables. Regions of the epidemiological parameter space, in which prioritizing the most vulnerable population is more effective than the most contagious individuals, depend strongly on the IFR age profile being, for example, substantially broader for COVID-19 in comparison with seasonal influenza.
