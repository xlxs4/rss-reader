          "description": "Abstract\nInverse obstacle scattering is the recovery of an obstacle boundary from the scattering data produced by incident waves. This shape recovery can be done by iteratively solving a PDE-constrained optimization problem for the obstacle boundary. While it is well known that this problem is typically non-convex and ill-posed, previous investigations have shown that in many settings these issues can be alleviated by using a continuation-in-frequency method and introducing a regularization that limits the frequency content of the obstacle boundary. It has been recently observed that these techniques can fail for obstacles with pronounced cavities, even in the case of penetrable obstacles where similar optimization and regularization methods work for the equivalent problem of recovering a piecewise constant wave speed. The present work investigates the recovery of obstacle boundaries for impenetrable, sound-soft media with pronounced cavities, given multi-frequency scattering data. Numerical examples demonstrate that the problem is sensitive to the choice of iterative solver used at each frequency and the initial guess at the lowest frequency. We propose a modified continuation-in-frequency method which follows a random walk in frequency, as opposed to the standard monotonically increasing path. This method shows some increased robustness in recovering cavities, but can also fail for more extreme examples. An interesting phenomenon is observed that while the obstacle reconstructions obtained over several random trials can vary significantly near the cavity, the results are consistent for non-cavity parts of the boundary.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIt has long been known that second order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equations with nonoscillatory coefficients admit nonoscillatory phase functions. This observation is the basis of many techniques for the asymptotic approximation of the solutions of such equations, as well as several schemes for their numerical solution. However, it was only relatively recently exploited to develop the first high-accuracy numerical solver for second order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equations which runs in time independent of frequency. Here, we introduce the first high-accuracy, frequency-independent method for the numerical solution of second order linear inhomogeneous ordinary differential equations. Our algorithm operates by constructing a nonoscillatory phase function representing the solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equation. Then, it uses an adaptive Levin scheme to construct a collection of auxiliary nonoscillatory functions that efficiently represent a highly oscillatory indefinite integral giving a particular solution of the inhomogeneous differential equation. Once the phase function and these auxiliary functions have been constructed, the inhomogeneous equation can be solved subject to essentially any reasonable boundary conditions. The results of numerical experiments illustrating the properties of our scheme are discussed.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe investigate the use of models from the theory of regularity structures as features in machine learning tasks. A model is a polynomial function of a space–time signal designed to well-approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), even in low regularity regimes. Models can be seen as natural multi-dimensional generalisations of signatures of paths; our work therefore aims to extend the recent use of signatures in data science beyond the context of time-ordered data. We provide a flexible definition of a model feature vector associated to a space–time signal, along with two algorithms which illustrate ways in which these features can be combined with linear regression. We apply these algorithms in several numerical experiments designed to learn solutions to PDEs with a given forcing and boundary data. Our experiments include semi-linear parabolic and wave equations with forcing, and Burgers’ equation with no forcing. We find an advantage in favour of our algorithms when compared to several alternative methods. Additionally, in the experiment with Burgers’ equation, we find non-trivial predictive power when noise is added to the observations.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper analyses the long-time behaviour of one-stage symplectic or symmetric trigonometric integrators when applied to nonlinear wave equations. It is shown that energy, momentum, and all harmonic actions are approximately preserved over a long time for one-stage explicit symplectic or symmetric trigonometric integrators when applied to nonlinear wave equations via spectral semi-discretisations. For the long-term analysis of symplectic or symmetric trigonometric integrators, we derive a multi-frequency modulated Fourier expansion of the trigonometric integrator and show three almost-invariants of the modulation system. In the analysis of this paper, we neither assume symmetry for symplectic methods, nor assume symplecticity for symmetric methods. The results for symplectic and symmetric methods are obtained as a byproduct of the above analysis. We also give another proof by establishing a relationship between symplectic and symmetric trigonometric integrators and trigonometric integrators which have been researched for wave equations in the literature.",

          "description": "Abstract\nPreconditioning techniques have been focused on multi-linear systems or tensor equations. However, to our knowledge, there is no relevant research on tensor complementarity problems. In this paper, we present a general preconditioner P for solving the tensor complementarity problem (TCP) involved with an \n                      \n                      \\({\\mathcal {L}}\\)\n                      \n                    -tensor \n                      \n                      \\({\\mathcal {A}}\\)\n                      \n                     and a vector q, and we prove that the TCP\n                      \n                      \\(({\\mathcal {A}},q)\\)\n                      \n                     is equivalent to the TCP\n                      \n                      \\((P{\\mathcal {A}},Pq)\\)\n                      \n                     under the assumption that \n                      \n                      \\(P{\\mathcal {A}}\\)\n                      \n                     is an \n                      \n                      \\({\\mathcal {L}}\\)\n                      \n                    -tensor. Based on this equivalence, a preconditioned fixed point iteration method is proposed for solving the tensor complementarity problem and its convergence analysis is given. For actual computations, we provide a concrete choice for the preconditioner P associated with a parameter satisfying above-mentioned hypothesis. In addition, it is proved theoretically that the convergence rate of the fixed point method with the chosen preconditioner P is at least as fast as that of the corresponding method without preprocessing. Meanwhile, we also obtain the monotony of the parameter on the performance of the preconditioned iterative method. Lastly, numerical examples are used to demonstrate the theoretical results.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWasserstein–Fisher–Rao (WFR) distance is a family of metrics to gauge the discrepancy of two Radon measures, which takes into account both transportation and weight change. Spherical WFR distance is a projected version of WFR distance for probability measures so that the space of Radon measures equipped with WFR can be viewed as metric cone over the space of probability measures with spherical WFR. Compared to the case for Wasserstein distance, the understanding of geodesics under the spherical WFR is less clear and still an ongoing research focus. In this paper, we develop a deep learning framework to compute the geodesics under the spherical WFR metric, and the learned geodesics can be adopted to generate weighted samples. Our approach is based on a Benamou–Brenier type dynamic formulation for spherical WFR. To overcome the difficulty in enforcing the boundary constraint brought by the weight change, a Kullback–Leibler divergence term based on the inverse map is introduced into the cost function. Moreover, a new regularization term using the particle velocity is introduced as a substitute for the Hamilton–Jacobi equation for the potential in dynamic formula. When used for sample generation, our framework can be beneficial for applications with given weighted samples, especially in the Bayesian inference, compared to sample generation with previous flow models.",

The semi-discrete systems naturally preserve the discrete contour part of the strong invariants and the relationship of the quadratic equation.

Transport coefficients, such as the mobility, thermal conductivity, and shear viscosity, are quantities of prime interest in statistical physics. At the macroscopic level, transport coefficients relate an external forcing of magnitude [math], with [math], acting on the system to an average response expressed through some steady-state flux. In practice, steady-state averages involved in the linear response are computed as time averages over a realization of some stochastic differential equation. Variance reduction techniques are of paramount interest in this context, as the linear response is scaled by a factor of [math], leading to large statistical error. One way to limit the increase in the variance is to allow for larger values of [math] by increasing the range of values of the forcing for which the nonlinear part of the response is sufficiently small. In theory, one can add an extra forcing to the physical perturbation of the system, called synthetic forcing, as long as this extra forcing preserves the invariant measure of the reference system. The aim is to find synthetic perturbations allowing one to reduce the nonlinear part of the response as much as possible. We present a mathematical framework for quantifying the quality of synthetic forcings, in the context of linear response theory, and discuss various possible choices for them. Our findings are illustrated with numerical results in low-dimensional systems.",

The low-order parametric descriptor systems are identified from transfer matrix samples by means of two-variable Lagrange rational matrix interpolation. This is done within the Loewner framework by deploying the new matrix-valued barycentric formula given in both right and left polynomial matrix fraction forms, which enables the construction of minimal parametric descriptor systems with rectangular transfer matrices. The developed method allows the reduction of order and parameter dependence complexity of the constructed system. Stability of the system is preserved by the postprocessing technique based on flipping signs of unstable poles. The developed methodology is illustrated with a few academic examples and applied to low-order parametric state-space identification of an aerodynamic system.",

We present a computational method for studying transverse homoclinic orbits for periodic solutions of delay differential equations, a phenomenon that we refer to as the Poincaré scenario. The strategy is geometric in nature and consists of viewing the connection as the zero of a nonlinear map, such that the invertibility of its Fréchet derivative implies the transversality of the intersection. The map is defined by a projected boundary value problem (BVP), with boundary conditions in the (finite dimensional) unstable and (infinite dimensional) stable manifolds of the periodic orbit. The parameterization method is used to compute the unstable manifold, and the BVP is solved using a discrete time dynamical system approach (defined via the method of steps) and Chebyshev series expansions. We illustrate this technique by computing transverse homoclinic orbits in the cubic Ikeda and Mackey–Glass systems.",

For reaction networks arising in systems biology, the capacity for two or more steady states, that is, multistationarity, is an important property that underlies biochemical switches. Another property receiving much attention recently is absolute concentration robustness (ACR), which means that some species concentration is the same at all positive steady states. In this work, we investigate the prevalence of each property while paying close attention to when the properties occur together. Specifically, we consider a stochastic block framework for generating random networks and prove edge-probability thresholds at which, with high probability, multistationarity appears and ACR becomes rare. We also show that the small window in which both properties occur only appears in networks with many species. Taken together, our results confirm that, in random reversible networks, ACR and multistationarity together, or even ACR on its own, is highly atypical. Our proofs rely on two prior results, one pertaining to the prevalence of networks with deficiency zero and the other “lifting” multistationarity from small networks to larger ones.",

Experimental and theoretical studies have indicated that interactions of certain proteins lead to the cell polarization which plays a key role in controlling the cell movement. We study the cell polarity and movement based on a class of biophysical models that consist of reaction-diffusion equations for different proteins and the dynamics of a moving cell boundary. Such a moving boundary is often simulated by a phase-field model. We first apply the matched asymptotic analysis to give a rigorous derivation of the sharp-interface model of the cell boundary from a phase-field model. We then develop a robust numerical approach that combines the level-set method to track the sharp boundary of a moving cell and accurate discretization techniques for solving the reaction-diffusion equations on the moving cell region. Our extensive numerical simulations predict the cell polarization under various kinds of stimuli and capture both the linear and the circular trajectories of a moving cell for a long period of time. In particular, we have identified some key parameters controlling different cell trajectories that are less accurately predicted by reduced models. Our work has linked different models and also developed tools that can be adapted for the challenging three-dimensional simulations.",

Because of the significance of remediating contaminated ecosystems, many mathematical models have been developed to describe the interactions between populations and toxicants in polluted aquatic environments. These models typically neglect the consequences of toxicant-induced behavioral changes on population dynamics. Taking into account that individuals may flee from areas with high toxicant concentrations to areas with low toxicant concentrations in order to improve their chances of survival, growth, and reproduction, we develop a diffusive population-toxicant model with toxicant-taxis. We establish the global well-posedness of our model and prove the global stability of spatially homogeneous toxicant-only steady states and population-toxicant coexistence steady states under some conditions. We find conditions under which stable spatially inhomogeneous steady states become unstable to trigger spatial pattern formations as the toxicant-taxis is strong. We also identify a narrow parameter regime in which toxicant-only and population-toxicant coexistence steady states are bistable. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate that spatial aggregation and segregation patterns between the population and the toxicant will typically emerge. Our study highlights the important effects of toxicant-induced movement responses on the spatial distributions of populations in polluted aquatic environments.",

One of the most important branches of nonlinear control theory of dynamical systems is the so-called sliding mode. Its aim is the design of a (nonlinear) feedback law that brings and maintains the state trajectory of a dynamic system on a given sliding surface. Here, dynamics become completely independent of the model parameters and can be tuned accordingly to the desired target. In this paper we study this problem when the feedback law is subject to strong structural constraints. In particular, we assume that the control input may take values only over two bounded and disjoint sets. Such sets could be also not perfectly known a priori. An example is a control input allowed to switch only between two values. Under these peculiarities, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee sliding-mode control effectiveness for a class of time-varying continuous-time linear systems that includes all the stationary state-space linear models. Our analysis covers several scientific fields. It is only apparently confined to the linear setting and also allows one study an important set of nonlinear models. We describe fundamental examples related to epidemiology where the control input is the level of contact rate among people and the sliding surface permits to control the number of infected. We prove the global convergence of epidemic sliding-mode control schemes applied to two popular dynamical systems used in epidemiology, i.e., SEIR and SAIR, and based on the introduction of severe restrictions like lockdowns. Results obtained in the literature regarding control of many other epidemiological models are also generalized by casting them within a general sliding-mode theory.",

The existence of HIV post-treatment controllers (PTCs) offers hope for an HIV functional cure, and understanding the critical mechanisms determining PTC represents a key step toward this goal. Here, we have studied these mechanisms by analyzing an established mathematical model for HIV viral dynamics. In mathematical models, critical mechanisms are represented by parameters that affect the tipping points to induce qualitatively different dynamics, and in cases with multiple stability, the initial conditions of the system also play a role in determining the fate of the solution. As such, for the tipping points in parameter space, we developed and implemented a sensitivity analysis of the threshold conditions of the associated bifurcations to identify the critical mechanisms for this model. Our results suggest that the infected cell death rate and the saturation parameter for cytotoxic T lymphocyte proliferation significantly affect post-treatment control. For the case with multiple stability, in state space of initial conditions, we first investigated the saddle-type equilibrium point to identify its stable manifold, which delimits trapping regions associated to the high and low viral set points. The identified stable manifold serves as a guide for the loads of immune cells and HIV virus at the time of therapy termination to achieve post-treatment control.",

While LCS admits a quadratic time solution, recent evidence suggests that solving the problem may be impossible in truly subquadratic time. A special case of LCS wherein each character appears at most once in every string is equivalent to the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem which can be solved in quasilinear time. In this work, we present novel algorithms for approximating LCS in truly subquadratic time and LIS in truly sublinear time. Our approximation factors depend on the ratio of the optimal solution size to the input size. We denote this ratio by [math] and obtain the following results for LCS and LIS without any prior knowledge of [math]: a truly subquadratic time algorithm for LCS with approximation factor [math] and a truly sublinear time algorithm for LIS with approximation factor [math].

The (unweighted) tree edit distance problem for [math] node trees asks to compute a measure of dissimilarity between two rooted trees with node labels. The current best algorithm from more than a decade ago runs in [math] time [Demaine et al., Automata, Languages and Programming, Springer, Berlin, 2007, pp. 146–157]. The same paper also showed that [math] is the best possible running time for any algorithm using the so-called decomposition strategy, which underlies almost all the known algorithms for this problem. These algorithms would also work for the weighted tree edit distance problem, which cannot be solved in truly subcubic time under the All-Pairs Shortest Paths conjecture [Bringmann et al., ACM Trans.

We consider an equivalent maximization problem and use a dynamic programming scheme involving matrices with many special properties. By using a decomposition scheme as well as several combinatorial techniques, we reduce tree edit distance to the max-plus product of bounded-difference matrices, which can be solved in truly subcubic time [Bringmann et al., Proceedings of the IEEE 57th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2016, pp. 375–384].",
