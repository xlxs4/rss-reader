          "description": "Abstract\nWe consider the Davey–Stewartson system in the hyperbolic–elliptic case (DS-II) in two dimensional case. It is a mass-critical equation, and was proved recently by Nachman et al. (Invent Math 220(2):395–451, 2020) the global well-posedness and scattering in \n                      \n                      \\(L^2\\)\n                      \n                    . In this paper, we give the numerical study on this model and construct a first order low-regularity integrator for the DS-II in the periodic case. It only requires the boundedness of one additional derivative of the solution to get the first order convergence. The Fast Fourier Transform is exploited to speed up the numerical implementation. By rigorous error analysis, we prove that the numerical scheme provides first order convergence in \n                      \n                      \\(H^{\\gamma }({\\mathbb {T}}^{2})\\)\n                      \n                     for rough initial data in \n                      \n                      \\(H^{\\gamma +1}({\\mathbb {T}}^{2})\\)\n                      \n                     with \n                      \n                      \\(\\gamma > 1\\)\n                      \n                    . The optimality of the convergence is conformed by numerical experience.",

Starting from adjacency tensors of uniform hypergraphs, we establish the multi-linear pseudo-PageRank (MLPPR) model, which is formulated as a multi-linear system with nonnegative constraints. The coefficient tensor of MLPPR is a kind of Laplacian tensors of uniform hypergraphs, which are almost as sparse as adjacency tensors since no dangling corrections are incorporated. Furthermore, all frontal slices of the coefficient tensor of MLPPR are M-matrices. Theoretically, MLPPR has a solution, which is unique under mild conditions. An error bound of the MLPPR solution is analyzed when the Laplacian tensor is slightly perturbed. Computationally, by exploiting the structural Laplacian tensor, we propose a tensor splitting algorithm, which converges linearly to a solution of MLPPR. Finally, numerical experiments illustrate that MLPPR is effective and efficient for hypergraph partitioning problems.",

          "description": "Abstract\nDiscrete wavelet methods, originally formulated in the setting of regularly sampled signals, can be adapted to data defined on a point cloud if some multiresolution structure is imposed on the cloud. A wide variety of hierarchical clustering algorithms can be used for this purpose, and the multiresolution structure obtained can be encoded by a hierarchical tree of subsets of the cloud. Prior work introduced the use of Haar-like bases defined with respect to such trees for approximation and learning tasks on unstructured data. This paper builds on that work in two directions. First, we present an algorithm for constructing Haar-like bases on general discrete hierarchical trees. Second, with an eye towards data compression, we present thresholding techniques for data defined on a point cloud with error controlled in the \n                      \n                      \\(L^{\\infty }\\)\n                      \n                     norm and in a Hölder-type norm.

In this work, we propose to design transferable neural feature spaces for the shallow neural networks from purely function approximation perspectives without using PDE information. The construction of the feature space involves the re-parameterization of the hidden neurons and uses auxiliary functions to tune the resulting feature space. Theoretical analysis shows the high quality of the produced feature space, i.e., uniformly distributed neurons. We use the proposed feature space as the pre-determined feature space of a random feature model, and use existing least squares solvers to obtain the weights of the output layer.

For this purpose, we consider a hybrid explicit HR scheme whose flux is a convex combination of first-order Rusanov flux and high-order flux. The conditions under which the explicit first-order HR scheme for shallow water equations satisfies the fully discrete entropy inequality have been studied. The flux limiters for the hybrid scheme are calculated from a corresponding optimization problem. Constraints for the optimization problem consist of inequalities that are valid for the first-order HR scheme and applied to the hybrid scheme. We apply the discrete cell entropy inequality with the proper numerical entropy flux to single out a physically relevant solution to the shallow water equations.

The method is designed based on the ELDG method for transport problems (J Comput Phys 446:110,632, 2021), which tracks solutions along approximations to characteristics in the DG framework, allowing extra large time stepping sizes with stability with respect to the classical RKDG method. Considering each characteristic family, a straightforward application of ELDG for the hyperbolic system will be to transform to the characteristic variables, evolve them on associated characteristic-related space–time regions, and transform them back to the original variables. However, the conservation could not be guaranteed in a general setting. In this paper, we formulate a conservative semi-discrete ELDG method by decomposing each variable into two parts, each of them associated with a different characteristic family. As a result, four different quantities are evolved in EL fashion and recombined to update the solution. The fully discrete scheme is formulated by using method-of-lines RK methods, with intermediate RK solutions updated on the background mesh. Numerical results for 1D and 2D wave equations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed ELDG method. These include the high order spatial and temporal accuracy, stability with extra large time stepping size, and conservative property.",

We propose a high-resolution scheme based on a moving mesh strategy for approximating solutions of ideal MHD and shallow water MHD (SWMHD) in this paper. Firstly, a new S-M flux limiter is constructed to weigh the ES flux and the anti-diffusive flux to obtain a new flux with high resolution and entropy stability properties. By adjusting the amplitude of anti-diffusive flux adaptively, the new flux can reduce its dissipation in smooth regions and increase dissipation at discontinuities, which is more consistent with physical laws. Secondly, we introduce the moving mesh strategy to optimize mesh generation and eliminate the defects of structured mesh. A new monitor function is defined to identify structural features of solutions at each particular time level and to assign appropriate weights to all regions with large numerical solution gradients, to construct a mesh evolution equation and increase the mesh density of these regions. Finally, we combine the moving mesh strategy with the high-resolution ES scheme and evaluate more accurate solutions according to the order of “mesh redistribution-update of solution-equation solving on new mesh”. Numerical results show that the new algorithm can achieve strong robustness and high resolution, and can track various waves effectively (especially the shock and rarefaction waves).",

Coarse-graining or model reduction is a term describing a range of approaches used to extend the timescale of molecular simulations by reducing the number of degrees of freedom. In the context of molecular simulation, standard coarse-graining approaches approximate the potential of mean force and use this to drive an effective Markovian model. To gain insight into this process, the simple case of a quadratic energy is studied in an overdamped setting. A hierarchy of reduced models is derived and analyzed, and the merits of these different coarse-graining approaches are discussed. In particular, while standard recipes for model reduction accurately capture static equilibrium statistics, it is shown that dynamical statistics, such as the mean-squared displacement, display systematic error, even when a system exhibits large timescale separation. In the linear setting studied, it is demonstrated both analytically and numerically that such models can be augmented in a simple way to better capture dynamical statistics.",

Models of this type seek to capture the interaction between active and inactive forms of two G-proteins, known as ROPs in plants, thought to underly cellular polarity formation. The systems conserve total concentration of each ROP, which enables reduction to simple canonical forms when one seeks conditions for homogeneous equilibria or heteroclinic connections between them. Transitions between different multiplicities of such states are classified using a novel application of catastrophe theory. For the time-dependent problem, the heteroclinic connections represent so-called wave-pinned states that separate regions of the domain with different ROP concentrations. It is shown numerically how the form of wave-pinning reached can be predicted as a function of the domain size and initial total ROP concentrations. This leads to state diagrams of different polarity forms as a function of total concentrations and system parameters.",

When the random diffusion is dominant, the perceptual scale does not affect the stability, but when the memory-based diffusion is dominant, there exist Turing bifurcations induced by the perceptual scale. Then the joint effect of the perceptual scale and the memory delay on the stability and spatio-temporal dynamics is investigated to show rich spatio-temporal dynamics via Turing–Hopf bifurcation and double Hopf bifurcation.

Our variables allow for a well-suited formulation in action-angle type coordinates associated with the averaged angles, which provide geometric insight into the problem. After introducing extra fictitious variables and through a symplectic transformation, we move to a singularity-free quaternionic triple-chart. This choice allows for a global chart to avoid the classical singularities associated with angles and renders all the invariants as homogeneous quadratic polynomials. Additionally, it permits one to quickly write the Hamiltonian of the system in terms of the invariants and the Poisson structure at each stage of the reduction process. In contrast with existing literature, the geometrical approach of this research completely describes all the dynamical aspects of the full reduced space since it involves the relative position of the rotational and orbital angular momenta and their orientation, which has yet to be considered in previous studies. Our program includes a preliminary parametric analysis of relative equilibria and a complete description of the fibers in the reconstruction of the reduced system.",

We analyze and quantify the amount of heat generated by a nanoparticle, injected in a background medium, while excited by incident electromagnetic waves. These nanoparticles are dispersive with electric permittivity following the Lorentz model. The purpose is to determine the quantity of heat generated extremely close to the nanoparticle (at a distance proportional to the radius of the nanoparticle). This study extends our previous results, derived in the 2D TM and TE regimes, to the full Maxwell system. We show that by exciting the medium with incident frequencies close to the plasmonic or Dielectric resonant frequencies, we can generate any desired amount of heat close to the injected nanoparticle while the amount of heat decreases away from it. These results offer a wide range of potential applications in the areas of photo-thermal therapy, drug delivery, and material science, to cite a few. To do so, we employ time-domain integral equations and asymptotic analysis techniques to study the corresponding mathematical model for heat generation. This model is given by the heat equation where the body source term comes from the modulus of the electric field generated by the used incident electromagnetic field. Therefore, we first analyze the dominant term of this electric field by studying the full Maxwell scattering problem in the presence of plasmonic or all-dielectric nanoparticles. As a second step, we analyze the propagation of this dominant electric field in the estimation of the heat potential. For both the electromagnetic and parabolic models, the presence of the nanoparticles is translated into the appearance of large scales in the contrasts for the heat-conductivity (for the parabolic model) and the permittivity (for the full Maxwell system) between the nanoparticle and its surroundings.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. We relate discrepancy theory with the classic scheduling problems of minimizing max flow time and total flow time on unrelated machines. Specifically, we give a general reduction that allows us to transfer discrepancy bounds in the prefix Beck–Fiala (bounded [math]-norm) setting to bounds on the flow time of an optimal schedule. Combining our reduction with a deep result proved by Banaszczyk via convex geometry gives guarantees of [math] and [math] for max flow time and total flow time, respectively, improving upon the previous best guarantees of [math] and [math]. Apart from the improved guarantees, the reduction motivates seemingly easy versions of prefix discrepancy questions: any constant bound on prefix Beck–Fiala where vectors have sparsity two (sparsity one being trivial) would already yield tight guarantees for both max flow time and total flow time. While known techniques solve this case when the entries take values in [math], we show that they are unlikely to transfer to the more general 2-sparse case of bounded [math]-norm.",

We strengthen the above lower bound to an average-case one, by proving that for all constants [math], there is a language in [math] that cannot be [math]-approximated by polynomial-size [math] circuits.

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. We consider the problem of clustering mixtures of mean-separated Gaussians in high dimensions. We are given samples from a mixture of [math] identity covariance Gaussians, so that the minimum pairwise distance between any two pairs of means is at least [math], for some parameter [math], and the goal is to recover the ground truth clustering of these samples. It is folklore that separation [math] is both necessary and sufficient to recover a good clustering (say, with constant or [math] error), at least information-theoretically. However, the estimators which achieve this guarantee are inefficient. We give the first algorithm which runs in polynomial time in both [math] and the dimension [math], and which almost matches this guarantee. More precisely, we give an algorithm which takes polynomially many samples and time, and which can successfully recover a good clustering, so long as the separation is [math], for any [math]. Previously, polynomial time algorithms were only known for this problem when the separation was polynomial in [math], and all algorithms which could tolerate [math] separation required quasipolynomial time. We also extend our result to mixtures of translations of a distribution which satisfies the Poincaré inequality, under additional mild assumptions. Our main technical tool, which we believe is of independent interest, is a novel way to implicitly represent and estimate high degree moments of a distribution, which allows us to extract important information about high degree moments without ever writing down the full moment tensors explicitly.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 53, Issue 1, Page 47-86, February 2024. \n Abstract. In the Maximum Independent Set problem we are asked to find a set of pairwise nonadjacent vertices in a given graph with the maximum possible cardinality. In general graphs, this classical problem is known to be NP-hard and hard to approximate within a factor of [math] for any [math]. Due to this, investigating the complexity of Maximum Independent Set in various graph classes in hope of finding better tractability results is an active research direction. In [math]-free graphs, that is, graphs not containing a fixed graph [math] as an induced subgraph, the problem is known to remain NP-hard and APX-hard whenever [math] contains a cycle, a vertex of degree at least four, or two vertices of degree at least three in one connected component. For the remaining cases, where every component of [math] is a path or a subdivided claw, the complexity of Maximum Independent Set remains widely open, with only a handful of polynomial-time solvability results for small graphs [math] such as [math], [math], the claw, or the fork. We prove that for every such “possibly tractable” graph [math] there exists an algorithm that, given an [math]-free graph [math] and an accuracy parameter [math], finds an independent set in [math] of cardinality within a factor of [math] of the optimum in time exponential in a polynomial of [math] and [math]. Furthermore, an independent set of maximum size can be found in subexponential time [math]. That is, we show that for every graph [math] for which Maximum Independent Set is not known to be APX-hard and SUBEXP-hard in [math]-free graphs, the problem admits a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme and a subexponential-time exact algorithm in this graph class. Our algorithms also work in the more general weighted setting, where the input graph is supplied with a weight function on vertices and we are maximizing the total weight of an independent set.",

Given a directed graph as input, we show how to efficiently find a shortest (directed, simple) cycle on an even number of vertices.

In fact, finding any even cycle in a directed graph in polynomial time was open for more than two decades until Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas (Ann. of Math.
