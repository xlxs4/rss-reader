          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose a stochastic Gauss–Newton (SGN) algorithm to study the online principal component analysis (OPCA) problem, which is formulated by using the symmetric low-rank product model for dominant eigenspace calculation. Compared with existing OPCA solvers, SGN is of improved robustness with respect to the varying input data and algorithm parameters. In addition, turning to an evaluation of data stream based on approximated objective functions, we develop a new adaptive stepsize strategy for SGN which requires no priori knowledge of the input data, and numerically illustrate its comparable performance with SGN adopting the manaully-tuned diminishing stepsize. Without assuming the eigengap to be positive, we also establish the global and optimal convergence rate of SGN with the specified stepsize using the diffusion approximation theory.",

The main idea is to replace the discrete advective velocity with an \n                      \n                      \\(H({\\text {div}})\\)\n                      \n                    -conforming divergence-free one in CONV.

The spectral Laplace transform satisfies standard properties of the 1D and 2D transforms, such as dilation, translation, scaling, derivation, localisation, and relations with the Fourier transform. The spectral Laplace transform is enough general to be applied to signals defined on different discrete data, such as graphs, 3D surface meshes, and point sets. Working in the spectral domain and applying polynomial and rational polynomial approximations, we achieve a stable computation of the spectral Laplace Transform. As main applications, we discuss the computation of the spectral Laplace Transform of functions defined on arbitrary domains (e.g., 2D and 3D surfaces, graphs), the solution of the heat diffusion equation, and graph signal processing.",

That is, PDEs with inputs that are expressed as functions of parameters with an associated probability distribution. Developing efficient and accurate solution strategies that account for errors on the space, time and parameter domains simultaneously is highly challenging. Indeed, it is well known that standard polynomial-based approximations on the parameter domain can incur errors that grow in time. In this work, we focus on advection–diffusion problems with parameter-dependent wind fields. A novel adaptive solution strategy is proposed that allows users to combine stochastic collocation on the parameter domain with off-the-shelf adaptive timestepping algorithms with local error control. This is a non-intrusive strategy that builds a polynomial-based surrogate that is adapted sequentially in time. The algorithm is driven by a so-called hierarchical estimator for the parametric error and balances this against an estimate for the global timestepping error which is derived from a scaling argument.",

We consider the effect of time-periodic forcing on a one-dimensional Schrödinger equation with a topologically protected defect (edge) mode. The unforced system models a domain wall or dislocation defect in a periodic structure, and it supports a defect mode which bifurcates from the Dirac point (linear band crossing) of the underlying bulk medium. We study the robustness of this state against time-periodic forcing of the type that arises in the study of Floquet topological insulators in condensed matter, photonics, and cold-atoms systems. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that under time-periodic forcing of sufficiently high frequency, the defect state undergoes radiative leakage of its energy away from the interface into the bulk; the time-decay is exponential on a time scale proportional to the inverse square of the forcing amplitude. The envelope dynamics of our Floquet system are approximately governed, on long time scales, by an effective (homogenized) periodically forced Dirac equation. Multiple scale analysis of the effective envelope dynamics yields an expansion of the radiating solution, which shows excellent agreement with our numerical simulations.",

In this paper, we present a multiscale framework for solving the Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media without scale separation and in the high frequency regime where the wavenumber [math] can be large. The main innovation is that our methods achieve a nearly exponential rate of convergence with respect to the computational degrees of freedom, using a coarse grid of mesh size [math] without suffering from the well-known pollution effect. The key idea is a nonoverlapped domain decomposition and its associated coarse-fine scale decomposition of the solution space that adapts to the media property and wavenumber; this decomposition is inspired by the multiscale finite element method. We show that the coarse part is of low complexity in the sense that it can be approximated with a nearly exponential rate of convergence via local basis functions, due to the compactness of a restriction operator that maps Helmholtz-harmonic functions to their interpolation residues on edges, while the fine part is local such that it can be computed efficiently using the local information of the right-hand side. The combination of the two parts yields the overall nearly exponential rate of convergence of our multiscale method. Our method draws many connections to multiscale methods in the literature, which we will comment in detail. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods theoretically and numerically; an exponential rate of convergence is consistently observed and confirmed. In addition, we observe the robustness of our methods regarding the high contrast in the media numerically. We specifically focus on 2D problems in our exposition since the geometry of nonoverlapped domain decomposition is simplest to explain in such cases.",

In this paper, we investigate the energy minimization model arising in the ensemble Kohn–Sham density functional theory for metallic systems, in which a pseudo-eigenvalue matrix and a general smearing approach are involved. We study the invariance of the energy functional and the existence of the minimizer of the ensemble Kohn–Sham model. We propose an adaptive two-parameter step size strategy and the corresponding preconditioned conjugate gradient methods to solve the energy minimization model. Under some mild but reasonable assumptions, we prove the global convergence for the gradients of the energy functional produced by our algorithms. Numerical experiments show that our algorithms are efficient, especially for large scale metallic systems. In particular, our algorithms produce convergent numerical approximations for some metallic systems, for which the traditional self-consistent field iterations fail to converge.",

The Minneart resonance is a low frequency resonance in which the wavelength is much larger than the size of the resonators.

The Kuramoto model provides a prototypical framework for synchronization phenomena in interacting particle systems. Apart from full phase synchrony where all oscillators behave identically, identical Kuramoto oscillators with ring-like nonlocal coupling can exhibit more elaborate patterns such as uniformly twisted states. It was discovered by Wiley, Strogatz, and Girvan in 2006 that the stability of these twisted states depends on the coupling range of each oscillator. In this paper, we analyze twisted states and their bifurcations in the infinite particle limit of ring-like nonlocal coupling. We not only consider traditional pairwise interactions as in the Kuramoto model but also demonstrate the effects of higher-order nonpairwise interactions, which arise naturally in phase reductions. We elucidate how pairwise and nonpairwise interactions affect the stability of the twisted states, compute bifurcating branches, and show that higher-order interactions can stabilize twisted states that are unstable if the coupling is only pairwise.",

Dynamical systems have a wide range of applications in mechanics, electrical engineering, chemistry, and so on. In this work, we propose the adaptive spectral Koopman (ASK) method to solve nonlinear autonomous dynamical systems. This novel numerical method leverages the spectral-collocation (i.e., pseudospectral) method and properties of the Koopman operator to obtain the solution of a dynamical system. Specifically, this solution is represented as a linear combination of the multiplication of the Koopman operator’s eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, and these eigenpairs are approximated by the spectral method. Unlike conventional time evolution algorithms such as Euler’s scheme and the Runge–Kutta scheme, ASK is mesh free and hence is more flexible when evaluating the solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate high accuracy of ASK for solving one-, two-, and three-dimensional dynamical systems.",

Killing represents a degradation that leads to removal of the moving particles with a given probability. Using the time dependent flux for the solution of the diffusion equation, we compute asymptotically the mean time for the fastest to escape alive.

By our analyses we could prove the existence of (at least) one optimal control pair. We derived first-order necessary conditions for optimality and proved some useful properties of such optimal solutions. Our general model can be specialized to include a number of subcases relevant for epidemics like COVID-19, such as, e.g., the arrival of vaccines in a second stage of the epidemic, and vaccine rationing, making social distancing the only optimizable instrument.

We determine that the critical patch size of our model is consistent with that of the Fisher–Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov equation, one of the first reaction-diffusion models proposed for GBM, and does not depend on parameters pertaining to the quiescent/necrotic population. The critical patch size may indicate that GBM tumors have a minimum size depending on the location in the brain. We also derive a theoretical relationship between the size of a GBM tumor at steady-state and its maximum cell density, which has potential applications for patient-specific parameter estimation based on magnetic resonance imaging data.

Spatial systems with heterogeneities are ubiquitous in nature, from precipitation, temperature, and soil gradients controlling vegetation growth to morphogen gradients controlling gene expression in embryos. Such systems, generally described by nonlinear dynamical systems, often display complex parameter dependence and exhibit bifurcations. The dynamics of heterogeneous spatially extended systems passing through bifurcations are still relatively poorly understood, yet recent theoretical studies and experimental data highlight the resulting complex behaviors and their relevance to real-world applications. We explore the consequences of spatial heterogeneities passing through bifurcations via two examples strongly motivated by applications.

Inverse problems of recovering space-dependent parameters, e.g., initial condition, space-dependent source, or potential coefficient in a subdiffusion model from the terminal observation have been extensively studied in recent years. However, all existing studies have assumed that the terminal time at which one takes the observation is exactly known. In this work, we present uniqueness and stability results for three canonical inverse problems, e.g., backward problem, inverse source, and inverse potential problems from the terminal observation at an unknown time. The subdiffusive nature of the problem indicates that one can simultaneously determine the terminal time and space-dependent parameter. The analysis is based on explicit solution representations, asymptotic behavior of the Mittag–Leffler function, and mild regularity conditions on the problem data. Further, we present several one- and two-dimensional numerical experiments to illustrate the feasibility of the approach.",

Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, is a systemic neurological disorder associated with the formation of toxic, pathological aggregates of proteins within the brain that lead to severe cognitive decline, and eventually, death. In normal physiological conditions, the brain rids itself of toxic proteins using various clearance mechanisms. The efficacy of brain clearance can be adversely affected by the presence of toxic proteins and is also known to decline with age. Motivated by recent findings, such as the connection between brain cerebrospinal fluid clearance and sleep, we propose a mathematical model coupling the progression of toxic proteins over the brain’s structural network and protein clearance. The model is used to study the interplay between clearance in the brain, toxic seeding, brain network connectivity, aging, and progression in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for the growing body of medical research showing that clearance plays an important role in the etiology, progression, and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. The study of a receptor-ligand system generally relies on the analysis of its dose-response (or concentration-effect) curve, which quantifies the relation between ligand concentration and the biological effect (or cellular response) induced when binding its specific cell surface receptor. Mathematical models of receptor-ligand systems have been developed to compute a dose-response curve under the assumption that the biological effect is proportional to the number of ligand-bound receptors. Given a dose-response curve, two quantities (or metrics) have been defined to characterize the properties of the ligand-receptor system under consideration: amplitude and potency (or half-maximal effective concentration, and denoted by EC[m…",

We consider steady states of dynamics that have an underlying network structure. We study how a steady state responds to small perturbations in the network parameters and how this sensitivity is connected to the network structure. We introduce a prototypical linear response equation and determine its sensitivity. This abstract result is applied to study the sensitivity of steady states in two common dynamics on networks: continuous-time Markov chains and deterministically modeled chemical reaction networks. For continuous-time Markov chains, we are able to efficiently compute the signs of the response in terms of the underlying network structure. The study of chemical reaction networks extends the sensitivity analysis to open systems with more complex network structures.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 52, Issue 4, Page 865-912, August 2023. \n Abstract. For a fixed finite collection of graphs [math] the [math]-M-Deletion problem is as follows: given an [math]-vertex input graph [math] find the minimum number of vertices that intersect all minor models in [math] of the graphs in [math]. by Courcelle’s Theorem, this problem can be solved in time [math] where [math] is the treewidth of [math] for some function [math] depending on [math]. In a recent series of articles, we have initiated the program of optimizing asymptotically the function [math]. Here we provide an algorithm showing that [math] for every collection [math]. Prior to this work, the best known function [math] was double-exponential in [math]. In particular, our algorithm vastly extends the results of Jansen, Lokshtanov, and Saurabh [Proc. of the 25th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), SIAM, 2014, pp. 1802–1811] for the particular case [math] and of Kociumaka and Pilipczuk [Algorithmica, 81 (2019), pp. 3655–3691] for graphs of bounded genus, and answers an open problem posed by Cygan et al. [Inform. Comput., 256 (2017), pp. 62–82]. We combine several ingredients such as the machinery of boundaried graphs in dynamic programming via representatives, the Flat Wall Theorem, bidimensionality, the irrelevant vertex technique, treewidth modulators, and protrusion replacement. Together with our previous results providing single-exponential algorithms for particular collections [math] [J. Baste, I. Sau, and D. M. Thilikos, Theoret. Comput. Sci., 814 (2020), pp. 135–152] and general lower bounds [J. Baste, I. Sau, and D. M. Thilikos, J. Comput. Syst. Sci., 109 (2020), pp. 56–77], our algorithm yields the following complexity dichotomy when [math] contains a single connected graph [math] assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis: [math] if [math] is a contraction of the chair or the banner, and [math] otherwise.",

The [math]-Opt heuristic is a simple improvement heuristic for the traveling salesman problem. It starts with an arbitrary tour and then repeatedly replaces [math] edges of the tour by [math] other edges, as long as this yields a shorter tour. We will prove that for the 2-dimensional Euclidean traveling salesman problem with [math] cities the approximation ratio of the [math]-Opt heuristic is [math]. This improves the upper bound of [math] given by Chandra, Karloff, and Tovey in [SIAM J. Comput., 28 (1999), pp. 1998–2029] and provides for the first time a nontrivial lower bound for the case [math]. Our results not only hold for the Euclidean norm but extend to arbitrary [math]-norms with [math].",
