          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose a class of discontinuous Galerkin methods under the scalar auxiliary variable framework (SAV-DG) to solve a biological patterning model in the form of parabolic–elliptic partial differential equation system. In particular, mixed-type discontinuous Galerkin approximations are used for the spatial discretization, aiming to achieve a balance between the high resolution and computational cost. Second and third order backward differentiation formulas are considered under SAV framework for discrete energy stability. Numerical experiments are provided to show the effectiveness of the fully discrete schemes and the governing factors of patterning formation.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper is devoted to analyzing multigrid algorithm for solving elliptic interface problems discretized using the partially penalized immersed finite element (PPIFE). By taking the average values of nodal variables and integral variables, we construct intergrid transfer operators for the \n                      \n                      \\(P_1\\)\n                      \n                     partially penalized immersed finite element (\n                      \n                      \\(P_1\\)\n                      \n                    -PPIFE) and the Crouzeix–Raviart partially penalized immersed finite element (CR-PPIFE), which satisfy certain stable approximation properties. An extra interface correction procedure is added in the smoothing steps to ensure the robustness of multigrid algorithm. We prove that the convergence of W-cycle multigrid algorithm and the condition number of the variable V-cycle as preconditioner are optimal by verifying the regularity-approximation assumption, which means that the convergence rate of algorithm is independent of mesh level, mesh size, and the position of the interface relative to the mesh. Numerical experiments illustrate the convergence of our algorithms using the W-cycle, V-cycle, and preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm (PCG) with the V-cycle.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper is concerned with the numerical analysis of linear and nonlinear Schrödinger equations with periodic analytic potentials. We prove that, for linear equations, when the potential is analytic in a strip of width A of the complex plane, the solution is analytic in the same strip, ensuring an exponential convergence of the planewave discretization of the equation with rate A. On the other hand, for nonlinear equations, we find that the solution may be analytic only in a strip of width smaller than A. This behavior is illustrated by two examples using a combination of numerical and analytical arguments.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIt is known that standard stochastic Galerkin methods encounter challenges when solving partial differential equations with high-dimensional random inputs, which are typically caused by the large number of stochastic basis functions required. It becomes crucial to properly choose effective basis functions, such that the dimension of the stochastic approximation space can be reduced. In this work, we focus on the stochastic Galerkin approximation associated with generalized polynomial chaos (gPC), and explore the gPC expansion based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition. A concise form of the gPC expansion is presented for each component function of the ANOVA expansion, and an adaptive ANOVA procedure is proposed to construct the overall stochastic Galerkin system. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed adaptive ANOVA stochastic Galerkin method for both diffusion and Helmholtz problems.",

          "description": "Abstract\nSimulating discontinuities has been a long-standing challenge, especially when dealing with shock waves characterized by strong nonlinear features. Despite their promise, the recently developed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have not yet fully demonstrated their effectiveness in handling discontinuities when compared to traditional shock-capturing methods. In this study, we reveal a paradoxical phenomenon during the training of PINNs when computing problems with strong nonlinear discontinuities. To address this issue and enhance the PINNs’ ability to capture shocks, we propose PINNs-WE (Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Equation Weight) method by introducing three novel strategies. Firstly, we attenuate the neural network’s expression locally at ‘transition points’ within the shock waves by introducing a physics-dependent weight into the governing equations. Consequently, the neural network will concentrate on training the smoother parts of the solutions. As a result, due to the compressible property, sharp discontinuities emerge, with transition points being compressed into well-trained smooth regions akin to passive particles. Secondly, we also introduce the Rankine–Hugoniot (RH) relation, which is equivalent to the weak form of the conservation laws near the discontinuity, in order to improve the shock-capturing preformance. Lastly, we construct a global physical conservation constraint to enhance the conservation properties of PINNs which is key to resolve the right position of the discontinuity. To illustrate the impact of our novel approach, we investigate the behavior of the one-dimensional Burgers’ equation, as well as the one- and two-dimensional Euler equations. In our numerical experiments, we compare our proposed PINNs-WE method with a traditional high-order weighted essential non-oscillatory (WENO) approach. The results of our study highlight the significant enhancement in discontinuity computing by the PINNs-WE method when compared to traditional PINNs.",

          "description": "Abstract\nEfficient and fast computation of a tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) with a few passes over the underlying data tensor is crucial because of its many potential applications. The current/existing subspace randomized algorithms need \n                      \n                      \\((2q+2)\\)\n                      \n                     passes over the data tensor to compute a t-SVD, where q is a non-negative integer number (power iteration parameter). In this paper, we propose an efficient and flexible randomized algorithm that can handle any number of passes q, which not necessary need be even. The flexibility of the proposed algorithm in using fewer passes naturally leads to lower computational and communication costs. This advantage makes it particularly appropriate when our task calls for several tensor decompositions or when the data tensors are huge. The proposed algorithm is a generalization of the methods developed for matrices to tensors. The expected/average error bound of the proposed algorithm is derived. Extensive numerical experiments on random and real-world data sets are conducted, and the proposed algorithm is compared with some baseline algorithms. The extensive computer simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is practical, efficient, and in general outperforms the state of the arts algorithms. We also demonstrate how to use the proposed method to develop a fast algorithm for the tensor completion problem.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 52, Issue 6, Page FOCS18-349-FOCS18-382, December 2023. \n Abstract. There are significant obstacles to establishing an equivalence between the worst-case and average-case hardness of [math]. Several results suggest that black-box worst-case to average-case reductions are not likely to be used for reducing any worst-case problem outside [math] to a distributional [math] problem. This paper overcomes the barrier. We present the first non-black-box worst-case to average-case reduction from a problem conjectured to be outside [math] to a distributional [math] problem. Specifically, we consider the minimum time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity problem (MINKT) and prove that there exists a zero-error randomized polynomial-time algorithm approximating the minimum time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity [math] within an additive error [math] if its average-case version admits an errorless heuristic polynomial-time algorithm. We observe that the approximation version of MINKT is Random 3SAT-hard, and more generally it is harder than avoiding any polynomial-time computable hitting set generator that extends its seed of length [math] by [math], which provides strong evidence that the approximation problem is outside [math] and thus our reductions are non-black-box. Our reduction can be derandomized at the cost of the quality of the approximation. We also show that, given a truth table of size [math], approximating the minimum circuit size within a factor of [math] is in [math] for some constant [math] iff its average-case version is easy. Our results can be seen as a new approach for excluding Heuristica. In particular, proving [math]-hardness of the approximation versions of MINKT or the minimum circuit size problem is sufficient for establishing an equivalence between the worst-case and average-case hardness of [math].",
