          "description": "Abstract\nIn the context of preserving stationary states, e.g. lake at rest and moving equilibria, a new formulation of the shallow water system, called flux globalization has been introduced by Cheng et al. (J Sci Comput 80(1):538–554, 2019). This approach consists in including the integral of the source term in the global flux and reconstructing the new global flux rather than the conservative variables. The resulting scheme is able to preserve a large family of smooth and discontinuous steady state moving equilibria. In this work, we focus on an arbitrary high order WENO finite volume (FV) generalization of the global flux approach. The most delicate aspect of the algorithm is the appropriate definition of the source flux (integral of the source term) and the quadrature strategy used to match it with the WENO reconstruction of the hyperbolic flux. When this construction is correctly done, one can show that the resulting WENO FV scheme admits exact discrete steady states characterized by constant global fluxes. We also show that, by an appropriate quadrature strategy for the source, we can embed exactly some particular steady states, e.g. the lake at rest for the shallow water equations. It can be shown that an exact approximation of global fluxes leads to a scheme with better convergence properties and improved solutions. The novel method has been tested and validated on classical cases: subcritical, supercritical and transcritical flows.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this work, we propose and analyze a high-order mapping operator between two grids to construct a high-order two-grid difference algorithm for nonlinear partial differential equations. This algorithm is then applied to solve a nonlinear time-fractional biharmonic equation for illustration, in which the cut-off technique and the auxiliary scheme approach are used to reduce the requirement on the nonlinear term to the local Lipschitz continuous condition, and the energy estimates are performed to avoid the usage of the inverse estimates and thus the time-step conditions. To treat the fractional operator, the Alikhanov’s scheme on the graded mesh is applied to deal with the weak singularity at initial time, while the compact difference method based on the order reduction is employed for high-order spatial discretization. The above methods and improvements as well as the properties of the high-order mapping operator are integrated with the analysis of the two-grid method to prove the unique solvability and the unconditionally robust error estimates of the proposed schemes under different norms. The developed techniques are further extended to discretize and analyze the two-grid method of two-dimensional problems. Numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the two-grid algorithms.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper presents a novel Arrow–Hurwicz type method for approximating the steady-state Navier Stokes equations using the finite element method. The novel method is inspired from artificial compressibility regularization of unsteady incompressible flows and allows one to circumvent solving saddle-point equations. We derive uniform boundedness and convergence to the exact solution whenever the small data condition for uniqueness of the solution is satisfied. A two-grid version of the scheme is also discussed. Numerical schemes show that the novel scheme significantly accelerates the convergence, without any additional computational cost or decreased accuracy.",

          "description": "Abstract\nA defining feature of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for ODE is that the piecewise polynomial solution can have a jump discontinuity at the beginning of each step. Starting from the standard integral formulation, the DG method is derived here in differential form. The key ingredient is a polynomial called the correction function, which helps ‘correct’ the discontinuous solution by approximating the jump and yields a continuous one. Under the right Radau quadrature, this continuous solution is shown to be identical to the solutions by the right Radau collocation and the continuous Galerkin (CG) methods. Next, the correction function facilitates the construction of the associated implicit Runge–Kutta schemes (IRK-DG). Different quadratures for DG result in different IRK-DG methods: left Radau quadrature in Radau IA, right Radau quadrature in Radau IIA or right Radau collocation, and Gauss quadrature in a method called DG-Gauss. The construction of IRK-DG via correction function also clarifies the meaning and facilitates the proofs of various \n                      \n                      \\(B(p)\\)\n                      \n                    , \n                      \n                      \\(C(\\eta )\\)\n                      \n                    , and \n                      \n                      \\(D(\\zeta )\\)\n                      \n                     conditions for accuracy.

This positivity property plays a crucial role in understanding the wellposedness of the DRE, and whether it could be inherited in the discrete level is a significant issue in numerical simulations. In this paper, we study positivity preserving time integration schemes by means of exponential integrators. The proposed exponential Euler and exponential midpoint schemes are linear and proven to be positivity preserving and unconditionally stable. Sharp error estimates of the schemes are also obtained.

Furthermore, square-root regression problems with structured sparsity also plays an important role in statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we focus on the numerical computation of large-scale linearly constrained sparse group square-root Lasso problems. In order to overcome the difficulty that there are two nonsmooth terms in the objective function, we propose a dual semismooth Newton (SSN) based augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) for it. That is, we apply the ALM to the dual problem with the subproblem solved by the SSN method. To apply the SSN method, the positive definiteness of the generalized Jacobian is very important. Hence we characterize the equivalence of its positive definiteness and the constraint nondegeneracy condition of the corresponding primal problem. In numerical implementation, we fully employ the second order sparsity so that the Newton direction can be efficiently obtained. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

In a stochastic reaction network setting we consider the problem of tracking the fate of individual molecules. We show that by using the classical large volume limit results, we may approximate the dynamics of a single tracked molecule in a simple and computationally efficient way. We give examples on how this approach may be used to obtain various characteristics of single-molecule dynamics (for instance, the distribution of the number of infections in a single individual in the course of an epidemic or the activity time of a single enzyme molecule). Moreover, we show how to approximate the overall dynamics of species of interest in the full system with a collection of independent single-molecule trajectories, and give explicit bounds for the approximation error in terms of the reaction rates. This approximation, which is well defined for all times, leads to an efficient and fully parallelizable simulation technique for which we provide some numerical examples.",

In particular, we demonstrate that the MMOs in this model are not due to generic folded singularities, but rather due to singularities at a cusp – not a fold – of the critical manifold. Using blowup, we determine the number of small-amplitude oscillations (SAOs) analytically, showing–-as for the folded nodes–-that they are determined by the Weber equation and the ratio of eigenvalues. We also show that the model undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation in the desingularized reduced problem, which–-although resembling a folded saddle-node (type II) at this level–-also occurs on a cusp, and not a fold. We demonstrate that this bifurcation is associated with the emergence of an invariant cylinder, the onset of SAOs, as well as SAOs of increasing amplitude.

We analyze a class of stochastic processes, referred to as asynchronous and semianonymous dynamics (ASD), over directed labeled random networks. These processes are a natural tool to describe general best-response and noisy best-response dynamics in network games where each agent, at random times governed by independent Poisson clocks, can choose among a finite set of actions. The payoff is determined by the relative frequency of the different actions among neighbors while being independent of the specific identities of neighbors. Using a local mean-field approach, we prove rigorously that, under certain conditions on the network and initial node configuration, the evolution of ASD can be approximated, in the large-scale limit, by the solution of a system of nonlinear ODEs. Our framework is very general and applies to a large class of graph ensembles for which the typical random graph is locally tree-like. In particular, we focus on labeled configuration-model random graphs, a generalization of the traditional configuration model which allows different classes of nodes to be mixed together in the network, permitting us, for example, to incorporate a community structure in the system. Our analysis also applies to configuration-model graphs having a power-law degree distribution, an essential feature of many real systems. To demonstrate the power and flexibility of our framework, we consider several examples of dynamics belonging to our class of stochastic processes. Moreover, we illustrate by simulation the applicability of our analysis to realistic scenarios by running our example dynamics over a real social network graph.",

In the absence of inertia, it has been known that the finiteness of collisions between oscillators is equivalent to the emergence of phase-locking. Thus, a natural question is whether this finiteness result is still valid for the Kuramoto model with inertia or not. In a small inertia regime, we show that the finiteness of collisions is also equivalent to phase-locking like the Kuramoto model.

In many applications it is required to determine a parameters set which is suitable for competing models. To this end, we are interested in ensemble methods to solve multiobjective optimization problems. Here, the ensemble Kalman Filter method is applied and adapted in order to solve coupled inverse nonlinear problems using a weighted function approach. An analysis of the mean field limit of the ensemble method yields an explicit update formula for the weights. Numerical examples show the improved performance of the proposed method.",

Feedback-based control of dynamical systems enables tracking of unstable branches that cannot be reached by the free evolution of a simulated or physical system. As the stationary points are stabilized with these control methods, the stability information on the original system gets lost in the data from the transient behavior reaching these equilibria. We introduce, by means of a physical experiment of the Zeeman catastrophe machine, a method to construct the whole bifurcation diagram including stability information about the underlying uncontrolled equilibria and the location of bifurcation points.",

The mystery of soaring birds, such as albatrosses and eagles, has intrigued biologists, physicists, aeronautical/control engineers, and applied mathematicians for centuries. These fascinating avian organisms are able to fly for long durations while expending little to no energy, utilizing wind to gain lift. This flight technique/maneuver is called dynamic soaring (DS). For biologists and physicists, the DS phenomenon is nothing but a wonder of the very elegant ability of these birds to interact with nature and use its physical ether in an optimal way for better survival and energy efficiency. For the engineering community, the DS phenomenon is a source of inspiration and an unequivocal opportunity for biomimicking. Mathematic…",

We propose finite-volume schemes for general continuity equations which preserve positivity and global bounds that arise from saturation effects in the mobility function. In the case of gradient flows, the schemes dissipate the free energy at the fully discrete level. Moreover, these schemes are generalized to coupled systems of nonlinear continuity equations, such as multispecies models in mathematical physics or biology, preserving the bounds and the dissipation of the energy whenever applicable. These results are illustrated through extensive numerical simulations which explore known behaviors in biology and showcase new phenomena not yet described by the literature.",
