          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper aims to explore a robust and efficient discrete scheme for poroelastic-elastic coupled problems. Based on staggered grids, a discrete scheme using finite difference methods is constructed in a form similar to domain decomposition. On this basis, another discrete scheme with a uniform form over the entire domain is derived. These two discrete schemes serve different purposes and are shown to be equivalent. The stability is easily derived by establishing a discrete variational formulation. To prove the convergence, appropriate discrete interpolations are introduced. It is proved that the discrete scheme has second-order superconvergence. Then, combined with the inf-sup condition, the first-order uniform convergence is obtained. This means the discrete scheme has great potential to overcome Poisson locking and pressure oscillations. Some numerical experiments are also carried out, and the results show the robustness and efficiency of the discrete scheme.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe present two finite difference time domain methods for the biharmonic nonlinear Schrödinger equation (BNLS) by reformulating it into a system of second-order partial differential equations instead of a direct discretization, including a second-order conservative Crank–Nicolson finite difference (CNFD) method and a second-order semi-implicit finite difference (SIFD) method.

Inverse problems, especially in a partial differential equation context, require a huge computational load due to the iterative optimization process. To accelerate such a procedure, we apply a numerical pipeline that involves artificial neural networks to parametrize the boundary conditions of the problem in hand, compress the dimensionality of the (full-order) snapshots, and approximate the parametric solution manifold. It derives a general framework capable to provide an ad-hoc parametrization of the inlet boundary and quickly converges to the optimal solution thanks to model order reduction.

The complexity of EOS in form gives rise to the difficulty in analyzing relevant wave patterns and in designing efficient numerical algorithms. In this paper, a strategy of local stiffened gas approximation is proposed for computing compressible fluid flows of real materials. The stiffened gas EOS is used to approximate general EOSs locally with certain thermodynamic compatibility at each interface of computational control volumes so that the exact Riemann solver can be significantly simplified and the computational cost of the resulting scheme is reduced up to two orders of magnitude. Then the generalized Riemann problem solver is further adopted not only to increase the accuracy and resolution but also to effectively reflect the thermodynamic effect through the inclusion of entropy variation into the numerical fluxes. The resulting scheme is demonstrated to be efficient and robust through typical numerical examples which display the excellent performance of such an approximation under extreme thermodynamics.",

Moreover, class weights applied RFC, weighted random forest (WRF), was used in the analysis. Due to the data structure, performance of the applied models was evaluated by the derivatives of confusion matrix. It is revealed that hybrid techniques implemented in RFC is suitable for handling highly imbalanced classes.

          "description": "Abstract\nThe quadrature-based method of moments (QMOM) offers a promising class of approximation techniques for reducing kinetic equations to fluid equations that are valid beyond thermodynamic equilibrium. In this work, we study a particular five-moment variant of QMOM known as HyQMOM and establish that this system is moment-invertible over a convex region in solution space. We then develop a high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for solving the resulting fluid system. The scheme is based on a predictor–corrector approach, where the prediction is a localized space-time DG scheme. The nonlinear algebraic system in this prediction is solved using a Picard iteration. The correction is a straightforward explicit update based on the time-integral of the evolution equation, where the space-time prediction replaces all instances of the exact solution. In the absence of limiters, the high-order scheme does not guarantee that solutions remain in the convex set over which HyQMOM is moment-realizable. To overcome this, we introduce novel limiters that rigorously guarantee that the computed solution does not leave the convex set of realizable solutions, thus guaranteeing the hyperbolicity of the system. We develop positivity-preserving limiters in both the prediction and correction steps and an oscillation limiter that damps unphysical oscillations near shocks. We also develop a novel extension of this scheme to include a BGK collision operator; the proposed method is shown to be asymptotic-preserving in the high-collision limit. The HyQMOM and the HyQMOM-BGK solvers are verified on several test cases, demonstrating high-order accuracy on smooth problems and shock-capturing capability on problems with shocks. The asymptotic-preserving property of the HyQMOM-BGK solver is also numerically verified.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe study of uncertainty propagation poses a great challenge to design high fidelity numerical methods. Based on the stochastic Galerkin formulation, this paper addresses the idea and implementation of the first flux reconstruction scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws with random inputs. High-order numerical approximation is adopted simultaneously in physical and random space, i.e., the modal representation of solutions is based on an orthogonal polynomial basis and the nodal representation is based on solution collocation points. Therefore, the numerical behaviors of the scheme in the (physical-random) phase space can be designed and understood uniformly. A family of filters is developed in multi-dimensional cases to mitigate the Gibbs phenomenon arising from discontinuities in both physical and random space. The filter function is switched on and off by the dynamic detection of discontinuous solutions, and a slope limiter is employed to preserve the positivity of physically realizable solutions. As a result, the proposed method is able to capture the stochastic flow evolution where resolved and unresolved regions coexist. Numerical experiments including a wave propagation, a Burgers’ shock, a one-dimensional Riemann problem, and a two-dimensional shock-vortex interaction problem are presented to validate the current scheme. The order of convergence of the high-order scheme is identified. The capability of the scheme for simulating smooth and discontinuous stochastic flow dynamics is demonstrated.

          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper introduces a novel approach to compute the numerical fluxes at the cell boundaries for a cell-centered conservative numerical scheme. Explicit gradients used in deriving the reconstruction polynomials are replaced by high-order gradients computed by compact finite differences, referred to as implicit gradients in this paper. A problem-independent shock capturing approach via Boundary Variation Diminishing (BVD) algorithm is used to suppress oscillations for the simulation of flows with shocks and material interfaces. Several numerical test cases are carried out to verify the proposed method’s capability using the implicit gradient method for compressible flows.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper we analyze a fully discrete scheme for a general Cahn–Hilliard equation coupled with a nonsteady Magneto-hydrodynamics flow, which describes two immiscible, incompressible and electrically conducting fluids with different mobilities, fluid viscosities and magnetic diffusivities. A typical fully discrete scheme, which is comprised of conforming finite element method and the Euler semi-implicit discretization based on a convex splitting of the energy of the equation is considered in detail. We prove that our scheme is unconditionally energy stable and obtain some optimal error estimates for the concentration field, the chemical potential, the velocity field, the magnetic field and the pressure. The results of numerical tests are presented to validate the rates of convergence.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this work, we consider numerical approximations of a thermally coupled incompressible magnetohydrodynamic problem. By combining the scalar auxiliary variable method and vector penalty projection approach, we construct a fully decoupled, unconditionally stable finite element scheme to solve this nonlinear and coupled multi-physics system efficiently. The proposed scheme has three distinct features: (i) although the nonlinear term is treated explicitly, the scheme is still unconditionally stable; (ii) it can approximate divergence-free solution, when penalty parameter tends to zero; (iii) all unknown physical quantities are decoupled, and only a series of linear elliptic equations with constant coefficient need to be solved. Moreover, the presented scheme is provably unconditionally stable. Then error estimates for the velocity field, magnetic field and temperature of the fully discrete scheme are established. Finally, various numerical simulations are provided to verify the features of the presented scheme.",

          "description": "Abstract\nTheoretically, the conditional expectation of a square-integrable random variable Y given a d-dimensional random vector X can be obtained by minimizing the mean squared distance between Y and f(X) over all Borel measurable functions \n                      \n                      \\(f :\\mathbb {R}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb {R}\\)\n                      \n                    . However, in many applications this minimization problem cannot be solved exactly, and instead, a numerical method which computes an approximate minimum over a suitable subfamily of Borel functions has to be used. The quality of the result depends on the adequacy of the subfamily and the performance of the numerical method. In this paper, we derive an expected value representation of the minimal mean squared distance which in many applications can efficiently be approximated with a standard Monte Carlo average. This enables us to provide guarantees for the accuracy of any numerical approximation of a given conditional expectation. We illustrate the method by assessing the quality of approximate conditional expectations obtained by linear, polynomial and neural network regression in different concrete examples.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) is a kind of game to find strategies for a group of players such that each player’s objective function is optimized. Solutions for GNEPs are called generalized Nash equilibria (GNEs). In this paper, we propose a numerical method for finding GNEs of GNEPs of polynomials based on the polyhedral homotopy continuation and the Moment-SOS hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations. We show that our method can find all GNEs if they exist, or detect the nonexistence of GNEs, under some genericity assumptions. Some numerical experiments are made to demonstrate the efficiency of our method.",
