          "description": "Abstract\nFinite volume, weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes require the computation of a smoothness indicator. This can be expensive, especially in multiple space dimensions. We consider the use of the simple smoothness indicator \n                      \n                      \\(\\sigma ^{\\textrm{S}}= \\frac{1}{N_{\\textrm{S}}-1}\\sum _{j} ({\\bar{u}}_{j} - {\\bar{u}}_{m})^2\\)\n                      \n                    , where \n                      \n                      \\(N_{\\textrm{S}}\\)\n                      \n                     is the number of mesh elements in the stencil, \n                      \n                      \\({\\bar{u}}_j\\)\n                      \n                     is the local function average over mesh element j, and index m gives the target element. Reconstructions utilizing standard WENO weighting fail with this smoothness indicator. We develop a modification of WENO-Z weighting that gives a reliable and accurate reconstruction of adaptive order, which we denote as SWENOZ-AO. We prove that it attains the order of accuracy of the large stencil polynomial approximation when the solution is smooth, and drops to the order of the small stencil polynomial approximations when there is a jump discontinuity in the solution. Numerical examples in one and two space dimensions on general meshes verify the approximation properties of the reconstruction. They also show it to be about 10 times faster in two space dimensions than reconstructions using the classic smoothness indicator. The new reconstruction is applied to define finite volume schemes to approximate the solution of hyperbolic conservation laws. Numerical tests show results of the same quality as standard WENO schemes using the classic smoothness indicator, but with an overall speedup in the computation time of about 3.5–5 times in 2D tests. Moreover, the computational efficiency (CPU time versus error) is noticeably improved.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe convective Allen–Cahn (CAC) equation has been widely used for simulating multiphase flows of incompressible fluids, which contains an extra convective term but still maintains the same maximum bound principle (MBP) as the classic Allen–Cahn equation. Based on the operator splitting approach, we propose a second-order semi-Lagrangian exponential time differencing method for solving the CAC equation, that preserves the discrete MBP unconditionally. In our scheme, the AC equation part is first spatially discretized via the central finite difference scheme, then it is efficiently solved by using the exponential time differencing method with FFT-based fast implementation. The transport equation part is computed by combining the semi-Lagrangian approach with a cut-off post-processing within the finite difference framework. MBP stability and convergence analysis of our fully discretized scheme are presented. In particular, we conduct an improved error estimation for the semi-Lagrangian method with variable velocity, so that the error of our scheme is not spoiled by the reciprocal of the time step size. Extensive numerical tests in two and three dimensions are also carried out to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the performance of our scheme.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThis work provides an inexact primal-dual algorithm for a large class of optimal transport problems. It is based on the implicit Euler discretization of a proper dynamical system for linearly constrained convex optimization problems, and by using the tool of Lyapunov function, the global (super-)linear convergence rate is established for the objective residual and feasibility violation. The presented method contains an inner problem that possesses a strong semismoothness property, which motivates the use of the semismooth Newton iteration. In addition, by exploring the hidden structure of the problem itself, the linear equation arising from the Newton step is transferred equivalently into a graph Laplacian system, for which a robust algebraic multigrid method is proposed and analyzed via the famous Xu–Zikatanov identity. Finally, numerical tests are provided to validate the efficiency of our method.",

We consider the symmetric integral form of these nonlocal equations defined on general geometries and in arbitrary bounded domains. A number of challenges are encountered when discretizing these equations. The first comes from the heterogeneous kernel singularity in the fractional integral operator. The second comes from the formally dense discrete operator with its quadratic growth in memory footprint and arithmetic operations. An additional challenge comes from the need to handle volume conditions—the generalization of classical local boundary conditions to the nonlocal setting.

          "description": "Abstract\nSimplicial complexes are generalizations of classical graphs. Their homology groups are widely used to characterize the structure and the topology of data in e.g. chemistry, neuroscience, and transportation networks. In this work we assume we are given a simplicial complex and that we can act on its underlying graph, formed by the set of 1-simplices, and we investigate the stability of its homology with respect to perturbations of the edges in such graph. Precisely, exploiting the isomorphism between the homology groups and the higher-order Laplacian operators, we propose a numerical method to compute the smallest graph perturbation sufficient to change the dimension of the simplex’s Hodge homology. Our approach is based on a matrix nearness problem formulated as a matrix differential equation, which requires an appropriate weighting and normalizing procedure for the boundary operators acting on the Hodge algebra’s homology groups. We develop a bilevel optimization procedure suitable for the formulated matrix nearness problem and illustrate the method’s performance on a variety of synthetic quasi-triangulation datasets and real-world transportation networks.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe polyhedral projection problem arises in various applications. To efficiently solve the dual problem, one of the crucial issues is to safely identify zero-elements as well as the signs of nonzero elements at the optimal solution. In this paper, relying on its nonsmooth dual problem and active set techniques, we first propose a Duality-Gap-Active-Set strategy (DGASS) to effectively identify the indices of zero-elements and the signs of nonzero entries of the optimal solution. Serving as an efficient acceleration strategy, DGASS can be embedded into certain iterative methods. In particular, by applying DGASS to both the proximal gradient algorithm (PGA) and the proximal semismooth Newton algorithm (PSNA), we propose the method of PGA-DGASS and PSNA-DGASS, respectively. Global convergence and local quadratic convergence rate are discussed. We report on numerical results over both synthetic and real data sets to demonstrate the high efficiency of the two DGASS-accelerated methods.",

Similar to the directional projection method of Calvo et. al. we use embedded Runge–Kutta methods to facilitate this in a computationally efficient manner. Proof of the accuracy of the modified RK methods and the existence of valid relaxation parameters are given, under some restrictions.

Dirac cones are conical singularities that occur near the degenerate points in band structures. Such singularities result in enormous unusual phenomena of the corresponding physical systems. This work investigates double Dirac cones that occur in the vicinity of a fourfold degenerate point in the band structures of certain operators. It is known that such degeneracy originates in the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We use two-dimensional periodic Schrödinger operators with novel designed symmetries as our prototype. First, we characterize admissible potentials, termed super honeycomb lattice potentials. They are honeycomb lattices potentials with a key additional translation symmetry. It is rigorously justified that Schrödinger operators with such potentials almost guarantee the existence of double Dirac cones on the bands at the [math] point, the origin of the Brillouin zone. We further show that the additional translation symmetry is an indispensable ingredient by a perturbation analysis. Indeed, the double cones disappear if the additional translation symmetry is broken. Many numerical simulations are provided which agree well with our analysis.",

The rotating shallow water equations with f-plane approximation and nonlinear bottom drag are a prototypical model for midlatitude geophysical flow that experience energy loss through simple topography. Motivated by numerical schemes for large-scale geophysical flow, we consider this model on the whole space with horizontal kinetic energy backscatter source terms built from negative viscosity and stabilizing hyperviscosity with constant parameters. We study its interplay with linear and nonsmooth quadratic bottom drag through the existence of coherent flows. Our results highlight that backscatter can have undesired amplification and selection effects, generating obstacles to energy distribution. We find that decreasing linear bottom drag destabilizes the trivial flow and generates nonlinear flows that can be associated with geostrophic equilibria (GE) and inertia-gravity waves (IGWs). The IGWs are periodic travelling waves, while the GE are stationary and can be studied by a plane wave reduction. We show that for isotropic backscatter both bifurcate simultaneously and supercritically, while for anisotropic backscatter the primary bifurcations are GE. In all cases, the presence of nonsmooth quadratic bottom drag implies unusual scaling laws. For the rigorous bifurcation analysis, by Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction, care has to be taken due to this lack of smoothness and since the hyperviscous terms yield a lack of spectral gap at large wave numbers. For purely smooth bottom drag, we identify a class of explicit such flows that behave linearly within the nonlinear equations: amplitudes can be steady and arbitrary, or grow exponentially and unboundedly. We illustrate the results by numerical computations and present extended branches in parameter space.",

Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has recently become a popular tool for the nonintrusive analysis of dynamical systems. Exploiting proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) as a dimensionality reduction technique, DMD is able to approximate a dynamical system as a sum of spatial bases evolving linearly in time, thus enabling a better understanding of the physical phenomena and forecasting of future time instants. In this work we propose an extension of DMD to parameterized dynamical systems, focusing on the future forecasting of the output of interest in a parametric context. Initially all the snapshots—for different parameters and different time instants—are projected to a reduced space; then DMD, or one of its variants, is employed to approximate reduced snapshots for future time instants. Exploiting the low dimension of the reduced space, we then combine the predicted reduced snapshots using regression techniques, thus enabling the possibility of approximating any untested parametric configuration in the future. This paper depicts in detail the algorithmic core of this method; we also present and discuss three test cases for our algorithm: a simple dynamical system with a linear parameter dependency, a heat problem with nonlinear parameter dependency, and a fluid dynamics problem with nonlinear parameter dependency.",

The extinction of species is a major problem of concern with a large literature. We investigate a differential equations model for population interactions with the goal of determining when several species (i.e., coordinates of a bounded solution) must die out or “go extinct” and must do so exponentially fast. Typically each coordinate represents the population density of a different species. For our main tool, we create what we call “die-out” Lyapunov functions. A given system may have several or many such functions, each of which is a function of a different set of coordinates. That die-out function implies that one of the species in its subset must die out exponentially fast—for almost every choice of coefficients of the system. We create a “team” of die-out functions that work together to show that [math] species must die, where [math] is determined separately. Second, we present a “trophic” condition for generalized Lotka–Volterra systems that guarantees that there is a trapping region that is globally attracting. That implies that all solutions are bounded.",

Reaction-diffusion models with nonlocal constraints naturally arise as limiting cases of coupled bulk-surface models of intracellular signalling. In this paper, a minimal, mass-conserving model of cell-polarization on a curved membrane is analyzed in the limit of slow surface diffusion. Using the tools of formal asymptotics and calculus of variations, we study the characteristic wave-pinning behavior of this system on three dynamical timescales. On the short timescale, generation of an interface separating high- and low-concentration domains is established under suitable conditions. Intermediate timescale dynamics are shown to lead to a uniform growth or shrinking of these domains to sizes that are fixed by global parameters. Finally, the long timescale dynamics reduce to area-preserving geodesic curvature flow that may lead to multi-interface steady state solutions. These results provide a foundation for studying cell polarization and related phenomena in biologically relevant geometries.",

Even if we restrict our attention to mass-action systems, all of these complex dynamical behaviors are still possible. On the other hand, if a polynomial dynamical system has a weakly reversible deficiency zero (WR0) realization, then its dynamics is known to be remarkably simple: oscillations and chaotic dynamics are ruled out, and, up to linear conservation laws, there exists a single positive steady state, which is asymptotically stable.

We propose an approach for the simultaneous reconstruction of the electromagnetic and acoustic material parameters, in the given medium [math] where we want to image, using the photoacoustic pressure, measured on a single point of the boundary of [math], generated by plasmonic nanoparticles injected inside [math]. As measurements, we use the generated pressure, that we denote by [math], depending on only one fixed point [math], where we measure, the time variable [math], in a large enough interval, and the incidence frequency [math], in a large enough band. These measurements are repeated while the location [math] of the nanoparticle is moved inside [math] to scan it. We show that these measurements (which are [math] in terms of dimensionality) are enough to reconstruct both the sound speed, the mass density, and the permittivity inside [math] (i.e., [math] coefficients of [math] each in terms of dimensionality). Indeed, from the behavior of the measured pressure in terms of time, we can estimate the travel time of the pressure, for arriving points inside [math], then using the eikonal equation we reconstruct the acoustic speed of propagation, inside [math]. In addition, we reconstruct the internal values of the acoustic Green’s function. From the singularity analysis of this Green’s function, we extract the integrals along the geodesics, for internal arriving points, of the logarithmic gradient of the mass density. Solving this (internal) integral geometric problem provides us with the values of the mass density function inside [math].

In this paper, we develop a data-driven inverse method based on discretizations of compartmental differential equation models for estimating time-varying transmission rates of infectious diseases. By developing iteration algorithms for three typical classes of infectious diseases, namely, a disease with seasonal cycles, a disease with nonseasonal cycles, and a disease with no obvious periodicity, we demonstrate that the discrete inverse method is a valuable tool for extracting information from available pandemic or epidemic incidence data. We also obtain insights for some epidemiological phenomena and issues of concern based on each application. Our method is highly intuitive and generates rapid implementation even with multiple years of data instances. In particular, it can be used in conjunction with other data-driven technologies, such as machine learning, to forecast future disease dynamics based on future weather conditions, policy decisions, or human mobility trends, providing guidance to public health authorities.",

This paper proposes a new mathematical formulation for flow measurement based on the inverse source problem for wave equations with partial boundary measurement. Inspired by the design of acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), we formulate an inverse source problem that can recover the flow field from the observation data on boundary receivers. To our knowledge, this is the first mathematical model of flow measurement using partial differential equations. This model is proved well-posed, and the corresponding algorithm is derived to compute the velocity field efficiently. Extensive numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our model. The comparison results demonstrate that our model is ten times more accurate than ADCP. Our formulation is capable of simulating a variety of practical measurement scenarios.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 52, Issue 4, Page 1039-1081, August 2023. \n Abstract. Modern applications of graph algorithms often involve the use of the output sets (usually, a subset of edges or vertices of the input graph) as inputs to other algorithms. Since the input graphs of interest are large and dynamic, it is desirable for an algorithm’s output to not change drastically when a few random edges are removed from the input graph, so as to prevent issues in postprocessing. Alternately, having such a guarantee also means that one can revise the solution obtained by running the algorithm on the original graph in just a few places in order to obtain a solution for the new graph. We formalize this feature by introducing the notion of average sensitivity of graph algorithms, which is t…",
