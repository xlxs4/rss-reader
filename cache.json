          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we first derive a theoretical basis for spherical conformal parameterizations between a simply connected closed surface \n                      \n                      \\(\\mathcal {S}\\)\n                      \n                     and a unit sphere \n                      \n                      \\(\\mathbb {S}^2\\)\n                      \n                     by minimizing the Dirichlet energy on \n                      \n                      \\(\\overline{\\mathbb {C}}\\)\n                      \n                     with stereographic projection. The Dirichlet energy can be rewritten as the sum of the energies associated with the southern and northern hemispheres and can be decreased under an equivalence relation by alternatingly solving the corresponding Laplacian equations. Based on this theoretical foundation, we develop a modified Dirichlet energy minimization with nonequivalence deflation for the computation of the spherical conformal parameterization between \n                      \n                      \\(\\mathcal {S}\\)\n                      \n                     and \n                      \n                      \\(\\mathbb {S}^2\\)\n                      \n                    . In addition, under some mild conditions, we verify the asymptotically R-linear convergence of the proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments on various benchmarks confirm that the assumptions for convergence always hold and demonstrate the efficiency, reliability and robustness of the developed modified Dirichlet energy minimization.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we locally construct a conservative flux for finite element solutions of elliptic interface problems with discontinuous coefficients. Since the Discontinuous Galerkin method has built-in conservative flux, we consider in this paper the conforming finite element method and a special type of nonconforming method with arbitrary orders. We also perform our analysis based on Nitsche’s method, which imposes the Dirichlet boundary condition weakly. The construction method is derived based on a mixed problem with one solution coinciding with the finite element solution and with the other solution being naturally used to obtain a conservative flux. We then apply the recovered flux to the a posteriori error estimation and prove the robust reliability and efficiency for conforming elements, under the assumption that the diffusion coefficient is quasi-monotone. Numerical experiments are provided to verify the theoretical results.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose a class of discontinuous Galerkin methods under the scalar auxiliary variable framework (SAV-DG) to solve a biological patterning model in the form of parabolic–elliptic partial differential equation system. In particular, mixed-type discontinuous Galerkin approximations are used for the spatial discretization, aiming to achieve a balance between the high resolution and computational cost. Second and third order backward differentiation formulas are considered under SAV framework for discrete energy stability. Numerical experiments are provided to show the effectiveness of the fully discrete schemes and the governing factors of patterning formation.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper is devoted to analyzing multigrid algorithm for solving elliptic interface problems discretized using the partially penalized immersed finite element (PPIFE). By taking the average values of nodal variables and integral variables, we construct intergrid transfer operators for the \n                      \n                      \\(P_1\\)\n                      \n                     partially penalized immersed finite element (\n                      \n                      \\(P_1\\)\n                      \n                    -PPIFE) and the Crouzeix–Raviart partially penalized immersed finite element (CR-PPIFE), which satisfy certain stable approximation properties. An extra interface correction procedure is added in the smoothing steps to ensure the robustness of multigrid algorithm. We prove that the convergence of W-cycle multigrid algorithm and the condition number of the variable V-cycle as preconditioner are optimal by verifying the regularity-approximation assumption, which means that the convergence rate of algorithm is independent of mesh level, mesh size, and the position of the interface relative to the mesh. Numerical experiments illustrate the convergence of our algorithms using the W-cycle, V-cycle, and preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm (PCG) with the V-cycle.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper is concerned with the numerical analysis of linear and nonlinear Schrödinger equations with periodic analytic potentials. We prove that, for linear equations, when the potential is analytic in a strip of width A of the complex plane, the solution is analytic in the same strip, ensuring an exponential convergence of the planewave discretization of the equation with rate A. On the other hand, for nonlinear equations, we find that the solution may be analytic only in a strip of width smaller than A. This behavior is illustrated by two examples using a combination of numerical and analytical arguments.",
