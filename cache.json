          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, Schur polynomials are used to provide a bidiagonal decomposition of polynomial collocation matrices. The symmetry of Schur polynomials is exploited to analyze the total positivity on some unbounded intervals of a relevant class of polynomial bases. The proposed factorization is used to achieve relative errors of the order of the unit round-off when solving algebraic problems involving the collocation matrix of relevant polynomial bases, such as the Hermite basis. The numerical experimentation illustrates the accurate results obtained when using the findings of the paper.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe present two methods for the numerical solution of an overdetermined symmetric hyperbolic and thermodynamically compatible (SHTC) model of compressible two-phase flows which has the peculiar feature that it is endowed with two entropy inequalities as primary evolution equations. The total energy conservation law is an extra conservation law and is obtained via suitable linear combination of all other equations based on the Godunov variables (main field). In the stiff relaxation limit the SHTC model tends to an asymptotically reduced Baer–Nunziato-type (BN) limit system with a unique choice for the interface velocity and the interface pressure, including parabolic heat conduction terms and additional lift forces that are not present in standard BN models. Both numerical schemes directly discretize the two entropy inequalities, including the entropy production terms, and obtain total energy conservation as a consequence. The first method is of the finite volume type and makes use of a thermodynamically compatible flux recently introduced by Abgrall et al. that allows to fulfill an additional extra conservation law exactly at the discrete level. The scheme satisfies both entropy inequalities by construction and can be proven to be nonlinearly stable in the energy norm. The second scheme is a general purpose discontinuous Galerkin method that achieves thermodynamic compatibility merely via the direct solution of the underlying viscous regularization of the governing equations. We show computational results for several benchmark problems in one and two space dimensions, comparing the two methods with each other and with numerical results obtained for the asymptotically reduced BN limit system. We also investigate the influence of the lift forces.",

We consider the use of the simple smoothness indicator \n                      \n                      \\(\\sigma ^{\\textrm{S}}= \\frac{1}{N_{\\textrm{S}}-1}\\sum _{j} ({\\bar{u}}_{j} - {\\bar{u}}_{m})^2\\)\n                      \n                    , where \n                      \n                      \\(N_{\\textrm{S}}\\)\n                      \n                     is the number of mesh elements in the stencil, \n                      \n                      \\({\\bar{u}}_j\\)\n                      \n                     is the local function average over mesh element j, and index m gives the target element. Reconstructions utilizing standard WENO weighting fail with this smoothness indicator. We develop a modification of WENO-Z weighting that gives a reliable and accurate reconstruction of adaptive order, which we denote as SWENOZ-AO. We prove that it attains the order of accuracy of the large stencil polynomial approximation when the solution is smooth, and drops to the order of the small stencil polynomial approximations when there is a jump discontinuity in the solution. Numerical examples in one and two space dimensions on general meshes verify the approximation properties of the reconstruction. They also show it to be about 10 times faster in two space dimensions than reconstructions using the classic smoothness indicator. The new reconstruction is applied to define finite volume schemes to approximate the solution of hyperbolic conservation laws. Numerical tests show results of the same quality as standard WENO schemes using the classic smoothness indicator, but with an overall speedup in the computation time of about 3.5–5 times in 2D tests. Moreover, the computational efficiency (CPU time versus error) is noticeably improved.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe convective Allen–Cahn (CAC) equation has been widely used for simulating multiphase flows of incompressible fluids, which contains an extra convective term but still maintains the same maximum bound principle (MBP) as the classic Allen–Cahn equation. Based on the operator splitting approach, we propose a second-order semi-Lagrangian exponential time differencing method for solving the CAC equation, that preserves the discrete MBP unconditionally. In our scheme, the AC equation part is first spatially discretized via the central finite difference scheme, then it is efficiently solved by using the exponential time differencing method with FFT-based fast implementation. The transport equation part is computed by combining the semi-Lagrangian approach with a cut-off post-processing within the finite difference framework. MBP stability and convergence analysis of our fully discretized scheme are presented. In particular, we conduct an improved error estimation for the semi-Lagrangian method with variable velocity, so that the error of our scheme is not spoiled by the reciprocal of the time step size. Extensive numerical tests in two and three dimensions are also carried out to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the performance of our scheme.",

We describe a class of vector fields exhibiting abundant switching near a heteroclinic network: for every neighborhood of the network and every infinite admissible path, the set of initial conditions within the neighborhood that follows the path has positive Lebesgue measure. The proof relies on the existence of “large” strange attractors in the terminology of Broer, Simó, and Tatjer [Nonlinearity, 11 (1998), pp. 667–770] near a heteroclinic tangle unfolding an attracting network with a two-dimensional heteroclinic connection. For our class of vector fields, any small nonempty open ball of initial conditions realizes infinite switching. We illustrate the theory with a specific one-parameter family of differential equations, for which we are able to characterize its global dynamics for almost all parameters.",

This paper investigates the stability and instability of a generalized reaction-diffusion-advection system, which describes a cross-talk between antigens and immune cells via chemokines in the immune system. Based on the spectral analysis, energy estimates, and bootstrap techniques, we first consider a linearized problem around the positive constant equilibrium and show how the reaction term and chemotactic strength affect the stability and instability of the linearized problem. Then we go a further step to study the stability and instability for the nonlinear system based on the linearized results. Moreover, the numerical simulations are carried out to support our analytically theoretical results. Our results not only extend the previous ones of [S. Lee et al., J. Math.

The rotating shallow water equations with f-plane approximation and nonlinear bottom drag are a prototypical model for midlatitude geophysical flow that experience energy loss through simple topography. Motivated by numerical schemes for large-scale geophysical flow, we consider this model on the whole space with horizontal kinetic energy backscatter source terms built from negative viscosity and stabilizing hyperviscosity with constant parameters. We study its interplay with linear and nonsmooth quadratic bottom drag through the existence of coherent flows. Our results highlight that backscatter can have undesired amplification and selection effects, generating obstacles to energy distribution. We find that decreasing linear bottom drag destabilizes the trivial flow and generates nonlinear flows that can be associated with geostrophic equilibria (GE) and inertia-gravity waves (IGWs). The IGWs are periodic travelling waves, while the GE are stationary and can be studied by a plane wave reduction. We show that for isotropic backscatter both bifurcate simultaneously and supercritically, while for anisotropic backscatter the primary bifurcations are GE. In all cases, the presence of nonsmooth quadratic bottom drag implies unusual scaling laws. For the rigorous bifurcation analysis, by Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction, care has to be taken due to this lack of smoothness and since the hyperviscous terms yield a lack of spectral gap at large wave numbers. For purely smooth bottom drag, we identify a class of explicit such flows that behave linearly within the nonlinear equations: amplitudes can be steady and arbitrary, or grow exponentially and unboundedly. We illustrate the results by numerical computations and present extended branches in parameter space.",

Systems of differential equations with polynomial right-hand sides are very common in applications. On the other hand, their mathematical analysis is very challenging in general, due to the possibility of complex dynamics: multiple basins of attraction, oscillations, and even chaotic dynamics. Even if we restrict our attention to mass-action systems, all of these complex dynamical behaviors are still possible. On the other hand, if a polynomial dynamical system has a weakly reversible deficiency zero (WR0) realization, then its dynamics is known to be remarkably simple: oscillations and chaotic dynamics are ruled out, and, up to linear conservation laws, there exists a single positive steady state, which is asymptotically stable. Here we describe an algorithm for finding WR0  realizations of polynomial dynamical systems, whenever such realizations exist.",

We propose an approach for the simultaneous reconstruction of the electromagnetic and acoustic material parameters, in the given medium [math] where we want to image, using the photoacoustic pressure, measured on a single point of the boundary of [math], generated by plasmonic nanoparticles injected inside [math]. As measurements, we use the generated pressure, that we denote by [math], depending on only one fixed point [math], where we measure, the time variable [math], in a large enough interval, and the incidence frequency [math], in a large enough band. These measurements are repeated while the location [math] of the nanoparticle is moved inside [math] to scan it. We show that these measurements (which are [math] in terms of dimensionality) are enough to reconstruct both the sound speed, the mass density, and the permittivity inside [math] (i.e., [math] coefficients of [math] each in terms of dimensionality). Indeed, from the behavior of the measured pressure in terms of time, we can estimate the travel time of the pressure, for arriving points inside [math], then using the eikonal equation we reconstruct the acoustic speed of propagation, inside [math]. In addition, we reconstruct the internal values of the acoustic Green’s function. From the singularity analysis of this Green’s function, we extract the integrals along the geodesics, for internal arriving points, of the logarithmic gradient of the mass density. Solving this (internal) integral geometric problem provides us with the values of the mass density function inside [math]. Finally, from the behavior of [math] with respect to the frequency [math], we detect the generated plasmonic resonances from which we reconstruct the permittivity inside [math].
