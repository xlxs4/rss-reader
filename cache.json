          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we develop a fully discrete fast multiscale Galerkin method for solving the boundary integral equation derived from the interior Dirichlet problem in a domain with corners. The integral operator in the equation can be split into two operators: a noncompact operator with a singular kernel and a compact operator with a piecewise smooth kernel. As shown in the paper, we develop two fast schemes to evaluate the entries of representation matrices for noncompact and compact operators. One is designed to compute integrals with algebraic singularities, and the other is a row-column scheme for evaluating the entries of the representing matrix of compact operators. We prove the proposed fully discrete method can achieve high-order convergence rates and only use the total number \n                      \n                      \\({\\mathscr {O}}(n2^n)\\)\n                      \n                     of arithmetic operators to generate the representing matrices where \n                      \n                      \\(2^n\\)\n                      \n                     is the number of the basis functions used in the method.

          "description": "Abstract\nThe FEAST eigensolver is extended to the computation of the singular triplets of a large matrix A with the singular values in a given interval. The resulting FEAST SVDsolver is subspace iteration applied to an approximate spectral projector of \n                      \n                      \\(A^TA\\)\n                      \n                     corresponding to the desired singular values in a given interval, and constructs approximate left and right singular subspaces corresponding to the desired singular values, onto which A is projected to obtain Ritz approximations. Differently from a commonly used contour integral-based FEAST solver, we propose a robust alternative that constructs approximate spectral projectors by using the Chebyshev–Jackson polynomial series, which are shown to be symmetric positive semi-definite with the eigenvalues in [0, 1]. We prove the pointwise convergence of this series and give compact estimates for pointwise errors of it and the step function that corresponds to the exact spectral projector of interest. We present error bounds for the approximate spectral projector and reliable estimates for the number of desired singular triplets, prove the convergence of the resulting FEAST SVDsolver, and propose practical selection strategies for determining the series degree and the subspace dimension. The solver and results on it are directly applicable or adaptable to the real symmetric and complex Hermitian eigenvalue problem. Numerical experiments illustrate that the FEAST SVDsolver is substantially more efficient than the contour integral-based FEAST SVDsolver, and it is also more robust and stable than the latter.",

The centered finite difference is taken as the spatial discretization. Meanwhile, the highly nonlinear and singular nature of the logarithmic energy potentials has always been the essential difficulty to design a second order accurate scheme in time, while preserving the variational energetic structures. The mobility function is updated with a second order accurate extrapolation formula, for the sake of unique solvability. A modified Crank–Nicolson scheme is used to approximate the logarithmic term, so that its inner product with the discrete temporal derivative exactly gives the corresponding nonlinear energy difference; henceforth the energy stability is ensured for the logarithmic part. In addition, nonlinear artificial regularization terms are added in the numerical scheme, so that the positivity-preserving property could be theoretically proved, with the help of the singularity associated with the logarithmic function. Furthermore, an optimal rate convergence analysis is provided in this paper, in which the higher order asymptotic expansion for the numerical solution, the rough error estimate and refined error estimate techniques have to be included to accomplish such an analysis. This work combines the following theoretical properties for a second order accurate numerical scheme for the PNP system: (i) second order accuracy in both time and space, (ii) unique solvability and positivity, (iii) energy stability, and (iv) optimal rate convergence. A few numerical results are also presented.",

We use lowest order Taylor–Hood and piecewise linear elements for discretizing the Navier–Stokes formulation in the bulk and the moving interface, respectively. We discuss a variety of schemes, amongst which is a linear scheme that enjoys an equidistribution property on the discrete interface and good volume conservation.

          "description": "Abstract\nSolving high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs) with the variational inference (VI) method is promising but still challenging. The main difficulties arise from two aspects. First, VI methods approximate the posterior distribution using a simple and analytic variational distribution, which makes it difficult to estimate complex spatially-varying parameters in practice. Second, VI methods typically rely on gradient-based optimization, which can be computationally expensive or intractable when applied to BIPs involving partial differential equations (PDEs). To address these challenges, we propose a novel approximation method for estimating the high-dimensional posterior distribution. This approach leverages a deep generative model to learn a prior model capable of generating spatially-varying parameters. This enables posterior approximation over the latent variable instead of the complex parameters, thus improving estimation accuracy. Moreover, to accelerate gradient computation, we employ a differentiable physics-constrained surrogate model to replace the adjoint method. The proposed method can be fully implemented in an automatic differentiation manner. Numerical examples demonstrate two types of log-permeability estimation for flow in heterogeneous media. The results show the validity, accuracy, and high efficiency of the proposed method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we study numerically several trace finite element methods for the Laplace–Beltrami eigenvalue problem on surfaces, including the original variant, a stabilized isoparametric element and a new method with exact geometric descriptions. The new variant is proposed directly on a smooth manifold which is implicitly given by a level-set function and require high order numerical quadrature on the surface. We show that without stabilization the eigenvalues of the discrete Laplace–Beltrami operator may coincide with only part of the eigenvalues of an embedded problem, which further corresponds to the finite eigenvalues for a singular generalized algebraic eigenvalue problem. The finite eigenvalues can be efficiently solved by a rank-completing perturbation algorithm in Hochstenbach et al. (SIAM J Matrix Anal Appl 40:1022–1046, 2019). We prove the new method has optimal convergence rate without considering the quadrature errors. The impact of the geometric consistency on the eigenvalue problem is carefully studied. Numerical experiments suggest that all the methods have optimal convergence rate while the geometric consistency can improve the numerical accuracy significantly.",

We give a new proof of local convergence of a multigrid method called iterative aggregation/disaggregation (IAD) for computing steady states of Markov chains. Our proof leads naturally to precise and interpretable estimates of the asymptotic rate of convergence. We study IAD as a model of more complex methods from statistical physics for computing nonequilibrium steady states, such as the nonequilibrium umbrella sampling method of Warmflash, Bhimalapuram, and Dinner [J. Chem. Phys., 127 (2007), 154112]. We explain why it may be possible to use methods like IAD to efficiently calculate steady states of processes in statistical physics and how to choose parameters to optimize efficiency.",

We leverage data-driven model discovery methods to determine governing equations for the emergent behavior of heterogeneous networked dynamical systems. Specifically, we consider networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators whose collective behavior approaches a limit cycle. Stable limit cycles are of interest in many biological applications, as they model self-sustained oscillations (e.g. heartbeats, chemical oscillations, neurons firing, circadian rhythm). For systems that display relaxation oscillations, our method automatically detects boundary (time) layer structures in the dynamics, fitting inner and outer solutions and matching them in a data-driven manner. We demonstrate the method on well-studied systems: the Rayleigh oscillator and the van der Pol oscillator. We then apply the mathematical framework to networks of semisynchronized Kuramoto, Rayleigh, Rössler, and FitzHugh–Nagumo oscillators, as well as heterogeneous combinations thereof, showing that the discovery of coarse-grained variables and dynamics can be accomplished with the proposed architecture.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems, Volume 22, Issue 3, Page 2624-2647, September 2023. \n Abstract. Traditional models of opinion dynamics, in which the nodes of a network change their opinions based on their interactions with neighboring nodes, consider how opinions evolve either on time-independent networks or on temporal networks with edges that follow Poisson statistics. Most such models are Markovian. However, in many real-life networks, interactions between individuals (and hence the edges of a network) follow non-Poisson processes and thus yield dynamics with memory-dependent effects. In this paper, we model opinion dynamics in which the entities of a temporal network interact and change their opinions via random social interactions. When the edges have non-Poisson interevent statistics, the corresponding opinion models have non-Markovian dynamics. We derive a family of opinion models that are induced by arbitrary waiting-time distributions (WTDs), and we illustrate a variety of induced opinion models from common WTDs (including Dirac delta distributions, exponential distributions, and heavy-tailed distributions). We analyze the convergence to consensus of these models and prove that homogeneous memory-dependent models of opinion dynamics in our framework always converge to the same steady state regardless of the WTD. We also conduct a numerical investigation of the effects of waiting-time distributions on both transient dynamics and steady states. We observe that models that are induced by heavy-tailed WTDs converge more slowly to a steady state than models that are induced by WTDs with light tails (or with compact support) and that entities with longer waiting times exert more influence on the mean opinion at steady state.",

We describe a class of vector fields exhibiting abundant switching near a heteroclinic network: for every neighborhood of the network and every infinite admissible path, the set of initial conditions within the neighborhood that follows the path has positive Lebesgue measure. The proof relies on the existence of “large” strange attractors in the terminology of Broer, Simó, and Tatjer [Nonlinearity, 11 (1998), pp. 667–770] near a heteroclinic tangle unfolding an attracting network with a two-dimensional heteroclinic connection. For our class of vector fields, any small nonempty open ball of initial conditions realizes infinite switching. We illustrate the theory with a specific one-parameter family of differential equations, for which we are able to characterize its global dynamics for almost all parameters.",

Since the seminal PPAD-completeness result for computing a Nash equilibrium even in two-player games, an important line of research has focused on relaxations achievable in polynomial time. In this paper, we consider the notion of an [math]-well-supported Nash equilibrium, where [math] corresponds to the approximation guarantee. Put simply, in an [math]-well-supported equilibrium, every player chooses with positive probability actions that are within [math] of the maximum achievable payoff against the other player’s strategy. Ever since the initial approximation guarantee of 2/3 for well-supported equilibria, which was established more than a decade ago, the progress on this problem has been extremely slow and incremental. Notably, the small improvements to 0.6608, and finally to 0.6528, were achieved by algorithms of growing complexity. Our main result is a simple and intuitive algorithm that improves the approximation guarantee to 1/2. Our algorithm is based on linear programming and in particular on exploiting suitably defined zero-sum games that arise from the payoff matrices of the two players. As a byproduct, we show how to achieve the same approximation guarantee in a query-efficient way.",
