          "description": "Abstract\nThe diffusive-viscous wave equation (DVWE) is widely used in seismic exploration since it can explain frequency-dependent seismic reflections in a reservoir with hydrocarbons. Most of the existing numerical approximations for the DVWE are based on domain truncation with ad hoc boundary conditions. However, this would generate artificial reflections as well as truncation errors. To this end, we directly consider the DVWE in unbounded domains. We first show the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of the solution of the DVWE. We then develop a Hermite spectral Galerkin scheme and derive the corresponding error estimate showing that the Hermite spectral Galerkin approximation delivers a spectral rate of convergence provided sufficiently smooth solutions. Several numerical experiments with constant and discontinuous coefficients are provided to verify the theoretical result and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, We verify the error estimate for both smooth and non-smooth source terms and initial conditions. In view of the error estimate and the regularity result, we show the sharpness of the convergence rate in terms of the regularity of the source term. We also show that the artificial reflection does not occur by using the present method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we investigate residual neural network (ResNet) method to solve ordinary differential equations. We verify the accuracy order of ResNet ODE solver matches the accuracy order of the data. Forward Euler, Runge–Kutta2 and Runge–Kutta4 finite difference schemes are adapted generating three learning data sets, which are applied to train three ResNet ODE solvers independently. The well trained ResNet solvers obtain 2nd, 3rd and 5th orders of one step errors and behave just as its counterpart finite difference method for linear and nonlinear ODEs with regular solutions. In particular, we carry out (1) architecture study in terms of number of hidden layers and neurons per layer to obtain optimal network structure; (2) target study to verify the ResNet solver is as accurate as its finite difference method counterpart; (3) solution trajectory simulations. A sequence of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and capability of ResNet solver.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a new Cartesian grid finite difference scheme is introduced for solving parabolic initial-boundary value problems involving irregular domains and Robin boundary condition in two and three dimensions. In spatial discretization, a ray-casting matched interface and boundary (MIB) method is utilized to enforce different types of boundary conditions, including Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and their mixed combinations, along the normal direction to generate necessary fictitious values outside the irregular domain. This allows accurate approximations of jumps in derivatives at various boundary locations so that the fourth-order central difference can be corrected at all Cartesian nodes. By treating such corrections as additional unknowns, the order of finite difference discretization of the Laplacian operator can be preserved. Moreover, by constructing corrections for different types of irregular and corner points, the proposed augmented MIB (AMIB) method can accommodate complicated geometries, while maintaining the fourth order of accuracy in space. In temporal discretization, the standard Crank–Nicolson scheme is employed, which is second-order in time and unconditionally stable. Furthermore, a Fast Sine Transform acceleration algorithm is employed to efficiently invert the discrete Laplacian, so that the augmented linear system in each time step can be solved with a complexity of \n                      \n                      \\(O(N \\log N)\\)\n                      \n                    , where N stands for the total spatial degree-of-freedom. The accuracy, stability and efficiency of the proposed AMIB method are numerically validated by considering various parabolic problems in two and three dimensions.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a new well-balanced discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is proposed for the shallow water equations in the sense of moving-water equilibria preservation. The significant ingredient for the scheme is the approximation of the equilibrium variables in the DG piecewise polynomial space, rather than the conservative variables in most existing well-balanced schemes. Thus, the conservative variables are non-polynomial functions of the equilibrium variables. This approach is easily accomplished without the reference equilibrium state recovery and a special source term approximation. To obtain the moving water equilibrium preservation of the scheme, the strategy pursued is to modify the numerical fluxes based on the generalized hydrostatic reconstruction. A rigorous theoretical analysis proves the exact equilibrium preservation of the scheme. Numerical tests demonstrate that this DG method is high-order accurate, successfully maintains the still water and the generalized moving water equilibria states, and captures small perturbations of the hydrostatic state without numerical oscillations near shocks even on the discontinuous bottom topography.",

We solve a linear algebraic equations system which satisfies the over-specified Neumann boundary condition to obtain the unspecified coefficients, and then the solution in the entire domain is permitted. Taking the solution into the governing equation, the unknown source and coefficient functions can be determined quickly. We also develop linear system methods to identify the coefficient and conductivity functions. It is remarkable that we do not need extra boundary data of the conductivity function to resolve the inverse conductivity problem. The present novel methods are verified to be accurate, effective, and robust, which are without solving nonlinear equations and executing iterations, and additional data used are quite economical.",

Based on our numerical results, DQ ROM errors are several orders of magnitude smaller than noDQ ones (in which the POD is constructed in a standard way, i.e., without the DQ approach) in terms of the energy kept by the ROM basis. Further, noDQ ROM errors have an optimal behavior, while DQ ROM errors, where the DQ is added to the POD process, demonstrate an optimality/super-optimality behavior.

We then generalize this energy argument to construct a global projection operator on special simplex meshes in multidimensions satisfying the so-called flow condition.

          "description": "Abstract\nExtreme learning machine (ELM) is a type of randomized neural networks originally developed for linear classification and regression problems in the mid-2000s, and has recently been extended to computational partial differential equations (PDE). This method can yield highly accurate solutions to linear/nonlinear PDEs, but requires the last hidden layer of the neural network to be wide to achieve a high accuracy. If the last hidden layer is narrow, the accuracy of the existing ELM method will be poor, irrespective of the rest of the network configuration. In this paper we present a modified ELM method, termed HLConcELM (hidden-layer concatenated ELM), to overcome the above drawback of the conventional ELM method. The HLConcELM method can produce highly accurate solutions to linear/nonlinear PDEs when the last hidden layer of the network is narrow and when it is wide. The new method is based on a type of modified feedforward neural networks (FNN), termed HLConcFNN (hidden-layer concatenated FNN), which incorporates a logical concatenation of the hidden layers in the network and exposes all the hidden nodes to the output-layer nodes. HLConcFNNs have the interesting property that, given a network architecture, when additional hidden layers are appended to the network or when extra nodes are added to the existing hidden layers, the representation capacity of the HLConcFNN associated with the new architecture is guaranteed to be not smaller than that of the original network architecture. Here representation capacity refers to the set of all functions that can be exactly represented by the neural network of a given architecture. We present ample benchmark tests with linear/nonlinear PDEs to demonstrate the computational accuracy and performance of the HLConcELM method and the superiority of this method to the conventional ELM from previous works.",

In this paper, we propose and validate a multiscale model for the description of particle diffusion in presence of trapping boundaries. We start from a drift-diffusion equation in which the drift term describes the effect of bubble traps and is modeled by a short-range potential with an attractive term and a repulsive core. The interaction of the particles attracted by the bubble surface is simulated by the Lennard–Jones potential that simplifies the capture due to the hydrophobic properties of the ions. In our model, the effect of the potential is replaced by a suitable boundary condition derived by mass conservation and asymptotic analysis. The potential is assumed to have a range of small size [math]. An asymptotic expansion in the [math] is considered, and the boundary conditions are obtained by retaining the lowest-order terms in the expansion. Another aspect we investigate is the saturation effect coming from high concentrations in the proximity of the bubble surface. The validity of the model is carefully checked with several tests in one and two dimensions and different geometries.",

This paper is concerned with the inverse elastic scattering problem for a random potential in three dimensions. Interpreted as a distribution, the potential is assumed to be a microlocally isotropic Gaussian random field whose covariance operator is a classical pseudodifferential operator. Given the potential, the direct scattering problem is shown to be well-posed in the sense of distributions by studying the equivalent Lippmann–Schwinger integral equation. For the inverse scattering problem, we demonstrate that the microlocal strength of the random potential can be uniquely determined with probability one by a single realization of the high frequency limit of the averaged compressional or shear backscattered far-field pattern of the scattered wave. The analysis employs the integral operator theory, the Born approximation in the high frequency regime, the microlocal analysis for the Fourier integral operators, and the ergodicity of the wave field.",

Dynamic contact angle hysteresis is of critical importance for many two-phase flow problems with moving contact lines. It is induced by inhomogeneity or roughness of the substrates. In this paper, we present theoretical studies on the time averaging of a reduced model for wetting on rough surfaces and also the analysis on the effect of stochastic thermal forces. We derive equations for the averaged dynamics and show that the apparent contact angle depends on the harmonic averaging of the geometric and chemical properties of the substrates as well as the contact line velocity. The contact angle hysteresis can be determined quantitatively by the equations. The averaging results are proved rigorously by multi-scale analysis and verified by some numerical examples.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Volume 83, Issue 2, Page 374-393, April 2023. \n Abstract. Understanding the properties of charge dynamics is crucial to many practical applications, such as electrochemical energy devices and transmembrane ion channels. This work proposes a Maxwell–Ampère Nernst–Planck (MANP) framework for the description of charge dynamics. The MANP model with a curl-free condition on the electric displacement is shown to be energy dissipative with respect to a convex free-energy functional, and demonstrated to be equivalent to the Poisson–Nernst–Planck model. By the energy dissipation law, the steady state of the MANP model reproduces the charge conserving Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) theory, providing an alternative energy stable approach to study the PB theory. In order to achieve the curl-free condition, a companion local curl-free relaxation algorithm, which is shown to naturally preserve the discrete Gauss’s law and converge robustly with linear computational complexity, is developed for the MANP model. One of the main advantages of our development is that it can efficiently deal with space-dependent permittivity instead of solving the variable-coefficient Poisson’s equation. Many-body effects such as ionic steric effects and Coulomb correlations can be incorporated within the MANP framework to derive modified MANP models for problems in which the mean-field approximation fails. Numerical results on the charge dynamics with such beyond mean-field effects in inhomogeneous dielectric environments are presented to demonstrate the performance of the MANP models in the description of charge dynamics, illustrating that the proposed MANP model provides a general framework for modeling charge dynamics.",

This article considers the minimization of the total number of infected individuals over the course of an epidemic in which the rate of infectious contacts can be reduced by time-dependent nonpharmaceutical interventions. The societal and economic costs of interventions are taken into account using a linear budget constraint which imposes a trade-off between short-term heavy interventions and long-term light interventions. We search for an optimal intervention strategy in an infinite-dimensional space of controls containing multiple consecutive lockdowns, gradually imposed and lifted restrictions, and various heuristic controls based, for example, on tracking the effective reproduction number. Mathematical analysis shows that among all such strategies, the global optimum is achieved by a single constant-level lockdown of maximum possible magnitude. Numerical simulations highlight the need for careful timing of such interventions and illustrate their benefits and disadvantages compared to strategies designed for minimizing peak prevalence. Rather counterintuitively, adding restrictions prior to the start of a well-planned intervention strategy may even increase the total incidence.",
