          "description": "Abstract\nPhysical models with uncertain inputs are commonly represented as parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). That is, PDEs with inputs that are expressed as functions of parameters with an associated probability distribution. Developing efficient and accurate solution strategies that account for errors on the space, time and parameter domains simultaneously is highly challenging. Indeed, it is well known that standard polynomial-based approximations on the parameter domain can incur errors that grow in time. In this work, we focus on advection–diffusion problems with parameter-dependent wind fields. A novel adaptive solution strategy is proposed that allows users to combine stochastic collocation on the parameter domain with off-the-shelf adaptive timestepping algorithms with local error control. This is a non-intrusive strategy that builds a polynomial-based surrogate that is adapted sequentially in time. The algorithm is driven by a so-called hierarchical estimator for the parametric error and balances this against an estimate for the global timestepping error which is derived from a scaling argument.",

          "description": "Abstract\nNon-overlapping Schwarz methods with generalized Robin transmission conditions were originally introduced by B. Després for time-harmonic wave propagation problems and have largely developed over the past thirty years. The aim of the paper is to provide both a review of the available formulations and methods as well as a consistent theory applicable to more general cases than studied until to date. An abstract variational framework is provided reformulating the original problem by the well-known form involving a scattering operator and an interface exchange operator, and the equivalence between the formulations is discussed thoroughly. The framework applies to a series of wave propagation problems throughout the de Rham complex, such as the scalar Helmholtz equation, Maxwell’s equations, a dual formulation of the Helmholtz equation in H(div), as well as any conforming finite element discretization thereof, and it applies also to coercive problems. Three convergence results are shown. The first one (using compactness) and the second one (based on absorption) generalize Després’ early findings and apply as well to the FETI-2LM formulation (a discrete method introduced by de La Bourdonnaye, Farhat, Macedo, Magoulés, and Roux). The third result, oriented on the work by Collino, Ghanemi, and Joly, establishes a convergence rate and covers cases with cross points, while not requiring any regularity of the solution. The key ingredient is a global interface exchange operator, proposed originally by X. Claeys and further developed by Claeys and Parolin, here worked out in full generality. The third type of convergence theory is applicable at the discrete level as well, where the exchange operator is allowed to be even local. The resulting scheme can be viewed as a generalization of the 2-Lagrange-multiplier method introduced by S. Loisel, and connections are drawn to another technique proposed by Gander and Santugini.",

Like all of the Godunov-type schemes, the proposed LDCU schemes are developed in three steps: reconstruction, evolution, and projection. A major novelty of our approach is in the projection step, which is based on a subcell resolution and designed to sharper approximate contact waves while ensuring a non-oscillatory property of the projected solution. In order to achieve this goal, we take into account properties of the contact waves. We design the LDCU schemes for both the one- and two-dimensional Euler equations of gas dynamics. The new schemes are tested on a variety of numerical examples. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that the proposed LDCU schemes contain substantially smaller amount of numerical dissipation and achieve higher resolution compared with their existing counterparts.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this work, we formulate a class of multiscale inverse problems within the framework of reinforcement learning (RL) and solve it by a sampling method. We propose a multi-agent actor-critic RL algorithm to accelerate the multi-level Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling once the problem is formulated as an RL process. The policies of the agents are used to generate proposals in the MCMC steps, and the critic, which is centralized, is in charge of estimating the expected reward. There are several difficulties in the implementation of the inverse problem involving features of multiple scales by using traditional MCMC sampling. Firstly, the computation of the posterior distribution involves evaluating the forward solver, which is time-consuming for problems with heterogeneities. This motivates to use the type of multi-level algorithms. Secondly, it is hard to find a proper transition function. To overcome these issues, we learn an RL policy as the proposal generator. We verify our proposed algorithm by solving different benchmark cases of multiscale inverse problems. Our experiments show that the proposed method improves the sampling process and speeds up the residual convergence.",

          "description": "Multiscale Modeling & Simulation, Volume 21, Issue 3, Page 849-883, September 2023. \n Abstract. In this paper, we present a multiscale framework for solving the Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media without scale separation and in the high frequency regime where the wavenumber [math] can be large. The main innovation is that our methods achieve a nearly exponential rate of convergence with respect to the computational degrees of freedom, using a coarse grid of mesh size [math] without suffering from the well-known pollution effect. The key idea is a nonoverlapped domain decomposition and its associated coarse-fine scale decomposition of the solution space that adapts to the media property and wavenumber; this decomposition is inspired by the multiscale finite element method. We show that the coarse part is of low complexity in the sense that it can be approximated with a nearly exponential rate of convergence via local basis functions, due to the compactness of a restriction operator that maps Helmholtz-harmonic functions to their interpolation residues on edges, while the fine part is local such that it can be computed efficiently using the local information of the right-hand side. The combination of the two parts yields the overall nearly exponential rate of convergence of our multiscale method. Our method draws many connections to multiscale methods in the literature, which we will comment in detail. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods theoretically and numerically; an exponential rate of convergence is consistently observed and confirmed. In addition, we observe the robustness of our methods regarding the high contrast in the media numerically. We specifically focus on 2D problems in our exposition since the geometry of nonoverlapped domain decomposition is simplest to explain in such cases.",

The Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model (the canonical example of a one-dimensional system with topologically protected localized defect states) is used to demonstrate the method. Our approach can be used to describe two broad classes of perturbations to periodic differential problems: those caused by inserting a finite-sized piece of arbitrary material and those caused by creating an interface between two different periodic media. The results presented here characterize the existence of localized eigenmodes in each case and, when they exist, determine their eigenfrequencies and provide concise analytic results that quantify the decay rate of these modes.

In this paper, we investigate the energy minimization model arising in the ensemble Kohn–Sham density functional theory for metallic systems, in which a pseudo-eigenvalue matrix and a general smearing approach are involved. We study the invariance of the energy functional and the existence of the minimizer of the ensemble Kohn–Sham model. We propose an adaptive two-parameter step size strategy and the corresponding preconditioned conjugate gradient methods to solve the energy minimization model. Under some mild but reasonable assumptions, we prove the global convergence for the gradients of the energy functional produced by our algorithms. Numerical experiments show that our algorithms are efficient, especially for large scale metallic systems. In particular, our algorithms produce convergent numerical approximations for some metallic systems, for which the traditional self-consistent field iterations fail to converge.",

The Minneart resonance is a low frequency resonance in which the wavelength is much larger than the size of the resonators.

Because the bubbles are usually compressible, in this paper we mainly investigate resonant modes of two general convex resonators with arbitrary shapes to extend the results of Ammari, Davies, and Yu in [Multiscale Model.

The Kuramoto model provides a prototypical framework for synchronization phenomena in interacting particle systems. Apart from full phase synchrony where all oscillators behave identically, identical Kuramoto oscillators with ring-like nonlocal coupling can exhibit more elaborate patterns such as uniformly twisted states. It was discovered by Wiley, Strogatz, and Girvan in 2006 that the stability of these twisted states depends on the coupling range of each oscillator. In this paper, we analyze twisted states and their bifurcations in the infinite particle limit of ring-like nonlocal coupling. We not only consider traditional pairwise interactions as in the Kuramoto model but also demonstrate the effects of higher-order nonpairwise interactions, which arise naturally in phase reductions. We elucidate how pairwise and nonpairwise interactions affect the stability of the twisted states, compute bifurcating branches, and show that higher-order interactions can stabilize twisted states that are unstable if the coupling is only pairwise.",

Dynamical systems have a wide range of applications in mechanics, electrical engineering, chemistry, and so on. In this work, we propose the adaptive spectral Koopman (ASK) method to solve nonlinear autonomous dynamical systems. This novel numerical method leverages the spectral-collocation (i.e., pseudospectral) method and properties of the Koopman operator to obtain the solution of a dynamical system. Specifically, this solution is represented as a linear combination of the multiplication of the Koopman operator’s eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, and these eigenpairs are approximated by the spectral method. Unlike conventional time evolution algorithms such as Euler’s scheme and the Runge–Kutta scheme, ASK is mesh free and hence is more flexible when evaluating the solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate high accuracy of ASK for solving one-, two-, and three-dimensional dynamical systems.",

The study of a receptor-ligand system generally relies on the analysis of its dose-response (or concentration-effect) curve, which quantifies the relation between ligand concentration and the biological effect (or cellular response) induced when binding its specific cell surface receptor. Mathematical models of receptor-ligand systems have been developed to compute a dose-response curve under the assumption that the biological effect is proportional to the number of ligand-bound receptors. Given a dose-response curve, two quantities (or metrics) have been defined to characterize the properties of the ligand-receptor system under consideration: amplitude and potency (or half-maximal effective concentration, and denoted by EC[m…",

Understanding and predicting the dynamical properties of systems involving dry friction is a major concern in physics and engineering. It abounds in many mechanical processes, from the sound produced by a violin to the screeching of chalk on a blackboard to human infant crawling dynamics and friction-based locomotion of a multitude of living organisms (snakes, bacteria, scallops) to the displacement of mechanical structures (building, bridges, nuclear plants, massive industrial infrastructures) under earthquakes and beyond. Surprisingly, even for low-dimensional systems, the modeling of dry friction in the presence of random forcing has not been elucidated. In this paper, we propose a piecewise deterministic Markov process approach modeling a system with dry friction including different coefficients for the static and dynamic forces. In this mathematical framework, we derive the corresponding Kolmogorov equations to compute statistical quantities of interest related to the distributions of the static (sticked) and dynamic phases. We show ergodicity and provide a representation formula of the stationary measure using independent identically distributed portions of the trajectory (excursions). We also obtain deterministic characterizations of the Laplace transforms of the probability density functions of the durations of the static and dynamic phases. In particular, the analysis of the power spectral density of the velocity reveals a critical value of the noise correlation time below which the correlations of the dynamic behaviors coincide with those of the white noise limit. The existence of such a critical value was already mentioned in the physical literature [Geffert and Just, Phys. Rev. E, 95 (2017), 062111].",

We develop a new Markov chain on graph partitions that makes relatively global moves yet is computationally feasible to be used as the proposal in the Metropolis–Hastings method. Our resulting algorithm is able to sample from a specified measure on partitions or spanning forests. Being able to sample from a specified measure is a requirement of what we consider as the gold standard in quantifying the extent to which a particular map is a gerrymander. Our proposal chain modifies the recently developed method called recombination (ReCom), which draws spanning trees on joined partitions and then randomly cuts them to repartition. We improve the computational efficiency by augmenting the statespace from partitions to spanning forests. The extra information accelerates the computation of the forward and backward proposal probabilities which are required for the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. We demonstrate this method by sampling redistricting plans on several measures of interest and find promising convergence results on several key observables of interest. We also explore some limitations in the measures that are efficient to sample from and investigate the feasibility of using parallel tempering to extend this space of measures.",

This paper studies the phase-only reconstruction problem of recovering a complex-valued signal [math] in [math] from the phase of [math] where [math] is a given measurement matrix in [math]. The reconstruction, if possible, should be up to a positive scaling factor. By using the rank of discriminant matrices, uniqueness conditions are derived to characterize whether the underlying signal can be uniquely reconstructed. We are also interested in the problem of minimal measurement number. We show that at least [math] but no more than [math] measurements are needed for the reconstruction of all [math], whereas the minimal measurement number is exactly [math] if we pursue the recovery of almost all signals. Moreover, when adapted to the phase-only reconstruction of [math], our uniqueness conditions are more practical and general than existing ones. Our theoretical results can be straightforwardly extended to affine phase-only reconstruction where the phase of [math] is observed for some [math].",
