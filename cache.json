          "description": "Abstract\nWe develop a distributed Block Chebyshev-Davidson algorithm to solve large-scale leading eigenvalue problems for spectral analysis in spectral clustering. First, the efficiency of the Chebyshev-Davidson algorithm relies on the prior knowledge of the eigenvalue spectrum, which could be expensive to estimate. This issue can be lessened by the analytic spectrum estimation of the Laplacian or normalized Laplacian matrices in spectral clustering, making the proposed algorithm very efficient for spectral clustering. Second, to make the proposed algorithm capable of analyzing big data, a distributed and parallel version has been developed with attractive scalability. The speedup by parallel computing is approximately equivalent to \n                      \n                      \\(\\sqrt{p}\\)\n                      \n                    , where p denotes the number of processes. Numerical results will be provided to demonstrate its efficiency in spectral clustering and scalability advantage over existing eigensolvers used for spectral clustering in parallel computing environments.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe propose an Eulerian–Lagrangian (EL) Runge–Kutta (RK) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for a linear hyperbolic system. The method is designed based on the ELDG method for transport problems (J Comput Phys 446:110,632, 2021), which tracks solutions along approximations to characteristics in the DG framework, allowing extra large time stepping sizes with stability with respect to the classical RKDG method. Considering each characteristic family, a straightforward application of ELDG for the hyperbolic system will be to transform to the characteristic variables, evolve them on associated characteristic-related space–time regions, and transform them back to the original variables. However, the conservation could not be guaranteed in a general setting. In this paper, we formulate a conservative semi-discrete ELDG method by decomposing each variable into two parts, each of them associated with a different characteristic family. As a result, four different quantities are evolved in EL fashion and recombined to update the solution. The fully discrete scheme is formulated by using method-of-lines RK methods, with intermediate RK solutions updated on the background mesh. Numerical results for 1D and 2D wave equations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed ELDG method. These include the high order spatial and temporal accuracy, stability with extra large time stepping size, and conservative property.",

          "description": "Abstract\nFor magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, the existing entropy stable (ES) flux effectively eliminates the spurious oscillation, but it still has potential for improvement such as the resolution of discontinuous solutions. We propose a high-resolution scheme based on a moving mesh strategy for approximating solutions of ideal MHD and shallow water MHD (SWMHD) in this paper. Firstly, a new S-M flux limiter is constructed to weigh the ES flux and the anti-diffusive flux to obtain a new flux with high resolution and entropy stability properties. By adjusting the amplitude of anti-diffusive flux adaptively, the new flux can reduce its dissipation in smooth regions and increase dissipation at discontinuities, which is more consistent with physical laws. Secondly, we introduce the moving mesh strategy to optimize mesh generation and eliminate the defects of structured mesh. A new monitor function is defined to identify structural features of solutions at each particular time level and to assign appropriate weights to all regions with large numerical solution gradients, to construct a mesh evolution equation and increase the mesh density of these regions. Finally, we combine the moving mesh strategy with the high-resolution ES scheme and evaluate more accurate solutions according to the order of “mesh redistribution-update of solution-equation solving on new mesh”. Numerical results show that the new algorithm can achieve strong robustness and high resolution, and can track various waves effectively (especially the shock and rarefaction waves).",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe Navier equation is the governing equation of elastic waves, and computing its solution accurately and rapidly has a wide range of applications in geophysical exploration, materials science, etc. In this paper, we focus on the efficient and high-precision numerical algorithm for the time harmonic elastic wave scattering problems from cornered domains via the boundary integral equations in two dimensions. The approach is based on the combination of Nyström discretization, analytical singular integrals and kernel-splitting method, which results in a high-order solver for smooth boundaries. It is then combined with the recursively compressed inverse preconditioning (RCIP) method to solve elastic scattering problems from cornered domains. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy, with stabilized errors close to machine precision in various geometric configurations. The algorithm is further applied to investigate the asymptotic behavior of density functions associated with boundary integral operators near corners, and the numerical results are highly consistent with the theoretical formulas.",

We mimic the continuous entropy analysis on the semi-discrete level with the DGSEM constructed on Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto (LGL) nodes. The use of LGL nodes endows the collocated nodal DGSEM with the summation-by-parts property that is key in the discrete analysis. The approximation exploits an equivalent flux differencing formulation for the volume contributions, which generate an entropy conservative split-form of the governing equations. A specific combination of a numerical surface flux and discretization of the nonconservative terms is then applied to obtain a high-order path-conservative scheme that is entropy conservative. Furthermore, we find that this combination yields an analogous discretization for the pressure and nonconservative terms such that the numerical method is well-balanced for discontinuous bathymetry on curvilinear domains. Dissipation is added at the interfaces to create an entropy stable approximation that satisfies the second law of thermodynamics in the discrete case, while maintaining the well-balanced property. We conclude with verification of the theoretical findings through numerical tests and demonstrate results about convergence, entropy stability and well-balancedness of the scheme.",

In this work, we consider a nonlinear strain-limiting elastic model in heterogeneous domains. We investigate heterogeneous material with soft and stiff inclusions and perforations that are important to understand an elastic solid’s behavior and crack-tip fields. Numerical solutions of problems in computational domains with inclusions and perforations require the construction of a sufficiently fine grid that resolves heterogeneity on the grid level. Approximations on such grids lead to a large system of equations with large computational costs. To reduce the size of the system and provide an accurate solution, we present a generalized multiscale finite element approximation on the coarse grid. In this method, we construct multiscale basis functions in each local domain associated with the coarse-grid cell and based on the construction of the snapshot space and solution of the local spectral problem reduce the size of the snapshot space. Two types of multiscale basis function construction are presented. The first type is a general case that can handle any boundary conditions on the global boundary of the heterogeneous domain. The considered problem requires an accurate approximation of the crack-surface boundary. In the second type of multiscale basis functions, we incorporate global boundary conditions in the basis construction process which provide an accurate approximation of the stress and strain on the crack boundary. We present numerical results for three cases of heterogeneity: soft inclusions, stiff inclusions, and perforations. A numerical investigation is presented for the two examples of loading on the domain with and without crack boundary conditions. The presented generalized multiscale finite element solver provides an accurate solution with a large reduction of the discrete system size. Our results illustrate the significant error reduction on the crack surface when we use the second type of basis functions.",

We previously showed that three-dimensional quadratic diffeomorphisms have anti-integrable (AI) limits that correspond to a quadratic correspondence, a pair of one-dimensional maps. At the AI limit the dynamics is conjugate to a full shift on two symbols. Here we consider a more general AI limit, allowing two parameters of the map to go to infinity. We prove the existence of AI states for each symbol sequence for three cases of the quadratic correspondence: parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas. A contraction argument gives parameter domains such that this is a bijection, but the correspondence also is observed to apply more generally. We show that orbits of the original map can be obtained by numerical continuation for a volume-contracting case. These results show that periodic AI states evolve into the observed periodic attractors of the diffeomorphism. We also continue a periodic AI state with a symbol sequence chosen so that it continues to an orbit resembling a chaotic attractor that is a 3D version of the classical 2D Hénon attractor.",

We revisit classical results on asymptotics of the scattering phase and point out that it is never monotone in the case of strong trapping of waves. Perhaps more importantly, we provide the first numerical calculations of scattering phases for nonradial scatterers.

We first establish the representation formula of the solution of the coupled system using the layer potential techniques. Based on the Fourier series, the perfect hydrodynamic cloaking and shielding conditions are derived for the control region with the cross-sectional shape being an annulus or a confocal ellipses. Then we further propose an optimization scheme for the design of approximate cloaks and shields within general geometries. The well-posedness of the optimization problem is proved. In particular, the conditions that can ensure the occurrence of approximate cloaks and shields for general geometries are also established. Our theoretical findings are validated and supplemented by a variety of numerical results.
