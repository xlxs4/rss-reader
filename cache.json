          "description": "Abstract\nIn this article, we propose and analyze a fully coupled, nonlinear, and energy-stable virtual element method (VEM) for solving the coupled Poisson–Nernst–Planck (PNP) and Navier–Stokes (NS) equations. These equations model microfluidic and electrochemical systems that include the diffuse transport of charged species within incompressible fluids coupled through electrostatic forces. A mixed VEM is employed to discretize the NS equations whereas classical VEM in primal form is used to discretize the PNP equations. The stability, existence and uniqueness of solution of the associated VEM are proved by fixed point theory. The global mass conservation and electric energy decay of the scheme are also established. Also, we rigorously derive unconditionally optimal error estimates for both the electrostatic potential and ionic concentrations of PNP equations in the \n                      \n                      \\(\\textrm{L}^{2}\\)\n                      \n                     and \n                      \n                      \\(\\textrm{H}^{1}\\)\n                      \n                    -norms, as well as for the velocity and pressure of NS equations in the \n                      \n                      \\(\\textbf{L}^{2}\\)\n                      \n                    , \n                      \n                      \\(\\textbf{H}^1\\)\n                      \n                    - and \n                      \n                      \\(\\textrm{L}^{2}\\)\n                      \n                    -norms, respectively.

The paper focuses on the theoretical analyses and computational efficiency of the proposed schemes, the Crank–Nicoloson scheme is proved to be unconditionally convergent and has maximum-norm boundness of numerical solutions. The exponential scalar auxiliary variable scheme is linearly implicit and decoupled, but lack of the maximum-norm boundness, also, the energy structure is modified.

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a block mirror stochastic gradient method is developed to solve stochastic optimization problems involving convex and nonconvex cases, where the feasible set and the variables are treated as multiple blocks. The proposed method combines the features of the classic mirror descent stochastic method and the block coordinate gradient descent method. Acquiring the stochastic gradient information by stochastic oracles, our method updates all the blocks of variables in the Gauss–Seidel type. We establish the convergence for both convex and nonconvex cases. The analysis of our method is challenging because the typical unbiasedness assumption of stochastic gradient fails to hold in the Gauss–Seidel renewal type and requires more specific assumptions. The proposed algorithm is tested on the conditional value-at-risk problem and the stochastic LASSO problem to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe level-set method is widely used in expanding front simulations in numerous fields of computational research, such as computer graphics, physics, or microelectronics. In the latter, the level-set method is employed for topography simulations of semiconductor device fabrication processes, being driven by complicated physical and chemical models. These models tend to produce surfaces with critical points where accuracy is paramount. To efficiently increase the accuracy in regions neighboring these critical points, automatic hierarchical domain refinement is required, guided by robust feature detection. Feature detection has to be computationally efficient and sufficiently accurate to reliably detect the critical points. To that end, we present a fast parallel geometric feature detection algorithm for three-dimensional level-set functions. Our approach is based on two different, complementary curvature calculation methods of the zero level-set and an optimized feature detection parameter to detect features. For performance reasons, our algorithm can be in principal linked to different curvature calculation methods, however, as will be discussed, two particularly attractive options are available: (i) A novel extension of the standard curvature calculation method for level-set functions, and (ii) an often disregarded method for calculating the curvature due to its purported low numerical accuracy. We show, however, that the latter is still a viable option, and that our algorithm is able to reliably detect features on geometries stemming from complicated, practically relevant geometries. Our algorithm and findings are applicable to other fields of applications such as surface simplification.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) method is one of the most popular method for uncertainty quantification. Being essentially a spectral approach, the gPC method exhibits the spectral convergence rate which heavily depends on the regularity of the solution in the random space. Many regularity studies have been made for stochastic elliptic and parabolic equations while regularities studies of stochastic hyperbolic equations has long been infeasible due to its intrinsic difficulties. In this paper, we investigate the impact of uncertainty on the time-dependent radiative transfer equation (RTE) with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions, which sits somewhere between hyperbolic and parabolic equations. We theoretically prove the a-priori bound of the solution, its continuity with respect to the scattering coefficient, and its regularity in the random space. These studies can serve as a building block in understanding the influence of uncertainties in the passage from hyperbolic to parabolic equations. Moreover, we vigorously justify the validity of the gPC expansion ansatz based on the regularity study. Then the stochastic Galerkin method of the gPC approach is employed to discretize the random variable. We further conduct a delicate analysis to show the exponential decay rate of the gPC coefficients and establish the error estimates of the stochastic Galerkin approximation for both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional random space cases. Numerical tests are presented to verify our analytical results.",

          "description": "Abstract\nSince their introduction the Transformer architectures emerged as the dominating architectures for both natural language processing and, more recently, computer vision applications. An intrinsic limitation of this family of “fully-attentive” architectures arises from the computation of the dot-product attention, which grows both in memory consumption and number of operations as \n                      \n                      \\(O(n^2)\\)\n                      \n                     where n stands for the input sequence length, thus limiting the applications that require modeling very long sequences. Several approaches have been proposed so far in the literature to mitigate this issue, with varying degrees of success. Our idea takes inspiration from the world of lossy data compression (such as the JPEG algorithm) to derive an approximation of the attention module by leveraging the properties of the Discrete Cosine Transform. An extensive section of experiments shows that our method takes up less memory for the same performance, while also drastically reducing inference time. Moreover, we assume that the results of our research might serve as a starting point for a broader family of deep neural models with reduced memory footprint. The implementation will be made publicly available at https://github.com/cscribano/DCT-Former-Public.",

Accelerated first-order methods such as the fast iterative shrinkage–thresholding algorithm (FISTA) have proven effective for numerous large composite models. In this paper, we present a new variation of FISTA, to be called C-FISTA, which obtains global linear convergence for a broader class of composite models than many of the latest FISTA variants. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of C-FISTA through multiple numerical experiments on group Lasso, group logistic regression and geometric programming models. Furthermore, we utilize Fenchel duality to show C-FISTA can solve the dual of a finite sum convex optimization model.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm is popular in solving min-max problems which are being widely used in a variety of areas. To improve the applicability and efficiency of PDHG for different application scenarios, we focus on the preconditioned PDHG (PrePDHG) algorithm, which is a framework covering PDHG, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and other methods. We give the optimal convergence condition of PrePDHG in the sense that the key parameters in the condition can not be further improved, which fills the theoretical gap in the-state-of-art convergence results of PrePDHG, and obtain the ergodic and non-ergodic sublinear convergence rates of PrePDHG. The theoretical analysis is achieved by establishing the equivalence between PrePDHG and indefinite proximal ADMM. Besides, we discuss various choices of the proximal matrices in PrePDHG and derive some interesting results. For example, the convergence condition of diagonal PrePDHG is improved to be tight, the dual stepsize of the balanced augmented Lagrangian method can be enlarged to 4/3 from 1, and a balanced augmented Lagrangian method with symmetric Gauss-Seidel iterations is also explored. Numerical results on the matrix game, projection onto the Birkhoff polytope, earth mover’s distance, and CT reconstruction verify the effectiveness and superiority of PrePDHG.",

In this paper, a two-scale approach for elastic shape optimization of fine-scale structures in additive manufacturing is investigated. To this end, a free material optimization is performed on the macro-scale using elasticity tensors in a set of microscopically realizable tensors. A database of these realizable tensors and their cost values is obtained with a shape and topology optimization on microscopic cells, working within a fixed set of elasticity tensors samples. This microscopic optimization takes into account manufacturability constraints via predefined material bridges to neighboring cells at the faces of the microscopic fundamental cell. For the actual additive manufacturing on a chosen fine-scale, a piecewise constant elasticity tensor ansatz on grid cells of a macroscopic mesh is applied. The macroscopic optimization is performed in an efficient online phase, whereas the associated cellwise optimal material patterns are retrieved from the database that was computed offline. For that, the set of admissible realizable elasticity tensors is parametrized using tensor product cubic B-splines over the unit square matching the precomputed samples. This representation is then efficiently used in an interior point method for the free material optimization on the macro-scale.",

When waves propagate through a complex medium like the turbulent atmosphere the wave field becomes incoherent and the wave intensity forms a complex speckle pattern. In this paper we study a speckle memory effect in the frequency domain and some of its consequences. This effect means that certain properties of the speckle pattern produced by wave transmission through a randomly scattering medium is preserved when shifting the frequency of the illumination. The speckle memory effect is characterized via a detailed novel analysis of the fourth-order moment of the random paraxial Green’s function at four different frequencies. We arrive at a precise characterization of the frequency memory effect and what governs the strength of the memory. As an application we quantify the statistical stability of time-reversal wave refocusing through a randomly scattering medium in the paraxial or beam regime. Time reversal refers to the situation when a transmitted wave field is recorded on a time-reversal mirror then time reversed and sent back into the complex medium. The re-emitted wave field then refocuses at the original source point. We compute the mean of the refocused wave and identify a novel quantitative description of its variance in terms of the radius of the time-reversal mirror, the size of its elements, the source bandwidth, and the statistics of the random medium fluctuations.",

Froyland, and T. Hls, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 21 (2022), pp. 1245–1286]. The angular value of dimension [math] measures the maximal average rotation which an [math]-dimensional subspace of the phase space experiences through the dynamics of a discrete-time linear system. Our main results relate the notion of angular value to the well-known dichotomy (or Sacker–Sell) spectrum and its associated spectral bundles. In particular, we prove a reduction theorem which shows that instead of maximizing over all subspaces, it suffices to maximize over so-called trace spaces which have their basis in the spectral fibers. The reduction leads to an algorithm for computing angular values of dimensions one and two. We apply the algorithm to several systems of dimension up to [math] and demonstrate its efficiency to detect the fastest rotating subspace even if it is not dominant under the forward dynamics.",

One of the most important problems arising in time series analysis is that of classifying the states of a dynamical system. That is, given a collection of time series, is it possible to perform two-state classification (chaotic versus periodic) of the underlying system? For this task, we turn to the field of topological data analysis, which encodes information about the shape and structure of data. In this paper, we investigate a more recent method for encoding the structure of the attractor as a weighted graph, known as the ordinal partition network, representing information about when the dynamical system has passed between certain regions of state space. We provide methods to incorporate the weighting information and show that this framework provides more resilience to noise or perturbations in the system as well as improving the accuracy of dynamic state identification.",

We present a mean-field formalism for modeling firing-rate statistics of brain regions whose neurons exhibit atypical firing patterns and heterogeneous electrophysiological properties. We apply the formalism to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)—the human circadian pacemaker—whose neurons can intrinsically exhibit depolarized low-amplitude membrane oscillations (DLAMOs), depolarization block (DB), and standard action potential firing at different times of day. Further, gamma-aminobutyric acid reversal potentials and molecular circadian phases of SCN neurons, among other properties, vary across the network and/or slowly over time. Our formalism consists of a system of integro-differential equations describing the time evolution of the mean and standard deviation of synaptic conductances across the network. Electrophysiological properties of SCN neurons are incorporated by computing responses to synaptic conductance inputs of a Hodgkin–Huxley-type SCN neuron model that exhibits DLAMOs and DB. Such responses are then averaged over distributions of relevant quantities and included in the differential equations. Results suggest mechanisms by which physiologically relevant changes to firing activities may arise, highlighting means by which the amplitude of firing rates may shrink, the standard deviation of firing rates may grow, and by which a mid-day dip in firing rates may appear. For instance, results show that a large spread in circadian phases across SCN neurons reduces the size of oscillations in SCN network firing activity across the 24-hour day, identifying a mechanism by which heterogeneities in neuron electrophysiology could influence circadian rhythms.",

Numerical simulations can facilitate the investigation of the relationship between the diffusion MRI signals and cellular structures. With the rapid advance of available computing power, the diffusion MRI community has begun to employ numerical simulations for model formulation and validation, as well as for imaging sequence optimization. Existing simulation frameworks use the finite difference method, the finite element method, or the Matrix Formalism method to solve the Bloch–Torrey partial differential equation. We propose a new method based on the efficient evaluation of layer potentials. In this paper, the mathematical framework and the numerical implementation of the new method are described. We demonstrate the convergence of our method via numerical experiments and analyze the errors linked to various model and simulation parameters.

Motivated by recent laboratory experiments, we study microbial populations with light-inducible genetic differentiation that generates a two-species microbial consortium relevant for bioproduction. First, we derive a hierarchy of models describing the evolution of the microbial populations, each with decreasing complexity. This sequential order reduction reveals the connections between several popular classes of models used in this context. Second, we demonstrate the analytical insight the order reduction provides by studying the optimal control of such a reduced-order system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Appealing to Pontryagin’s maximum principle, we find different optimal control structures within different regions of the parameter space. Explicit solutions are obtained in a subset of parameter space, while, for the remainder of parameter space, closed-form solutions are obtained that depend on a scalar value that solves a particular transcendental equation.

We study the problem of computing the [math] norm of a matrix [math], defined as [math]. This problem generalizes the spectral norm of a matrix ([math]) and the Grothendieck problem ([math], [math]) and has been widely studied in various regimes. When [math], the problem exhibits a dichotomy: constant factor approximation algorithms are known if [math], and the problem is hard to approximate within almost polynomial factors when [math]. The regime when [math], known as hypercontractive norms, is particularly significant for various applications but much less well understood. The case with [math] and [math] was studied by Barak et al. [Proceedings of the 44th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2012, pp. 307–326], who gave subexponential algorithms for a promise version of the problem (which captures small-set expansion) and also proved hardness of approximation results based on the exponential time hypothesis. However, no NP-hardness of approximation is known for these problems for any [math]. We prove the first NP-hardness result (under randomized reductions) for approximating hypercontractive norms. We show that for any [math] with [math], [math] is hard to approximate within [math] assuming [math]. En route to the above result, we also prove almost tight results for the case when [math] with [math].",

The movement cost is the distance between consecutive such points. The competitive ratio is the worst case ratio (over request sequences) between the total movement of the online algorithm and the smallest movement one could have achieved by knowing in advance the request sequence. The family [math] is said to be chaseable if there exists an online algorithm with finite competitive ratio.

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. We prove the existence of an oblivious routing scheme that is [math]-competitive in terms of [math], thus resolving a well-known question in oblivious routing. Concretely, consider an undirected network and a set of packets each with its own source and destination. The objective is to choose a path for each packet, from its source to its destination, so as to minimize [math], defined as follows: The dilation is the maximum path hop length, and the congestion is the maximum number of paths that include any single edge. The routing scheme obliviously and randomly selects a path for each packet independent of (the existence of) the other packets. Despite this obliviousness, the selected paths have [math] within a [math] factor of the best possible value. More precisely, for any integer hop constraint [math], this oblivious routing scheme selects paths of length at most [math] and is [math]-competitive in terms of congestion in comparison to the best possible congestion achievable via paths of length at most [math] hops. These paths can be sampled in polynomial time. This result can be viewed as an analogue of the celebrated oblivious routing results of Räcke [Proceedings of the 43rd Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2002; Proceedings of the 40th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2008], which are [math]-competitive in terms of congestion but are not competitive in terms of dilation.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. Submodular function minimization (SFM) and matroid intersection are fundamental discrete optimization problems with applications in many fields. It is well known that both of these can be solved making [math] queries to a relevant oracle (evaluation oracle for SFM and rank oracle for matroid intersection), where [math] denotes the universe size. However, all known polynomial query algorithms are highly adaptive, requiring at least [math] rounds of querying the oracle. A natural question is whether these can be efficiently solved in a highly parallel manner, namely, with [math] queries using only polylogarithmic rounds of adaptivity. An important step towards understanding the adaptivity needed for efficient parallel SFM was taken recently in the work of Balkanski and Singer who showed that any SFM algorithm making [math] queries necessarily requires [math] rounds. This left open the possibility of efficient SFM algorithms in polylogarithmic rounds. For matroid intersection, even the possibility of a constant round, [math] query algorithm was not hitherto ruled out. In this work, we prove that any, possibly randomized, algorithm for submodular function minimization or matroid intersection making [math] queries requires (Throughout the paper, we use the usual convention of using [math] to denote [math] and using [math] to denote [math] for some unspecified constant [math]) [math] rounds of adaptivity. In fact, we show a polynomial lower bound on the number of rounds of adaptivity even for algorithms that make at most [math] queries for any constant [math]. Therefore, even though SFM and matroid intersection are efficiently solvable, they are not highly parallelizable in the oracle model.",
