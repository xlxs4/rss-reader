          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper presents a new strategy to deal with the excessive diffusion that standard finite volume methods for compressible Euler equations display in the limit of low Mach number. The strategy can be understood as using centered discretizations for the acoustic part of the Euler equations and stabilizing them with a leap-frog-type (“sequential explicit”) time integration, a fully explicit method. This time integration takes inspiration from time-explicit staggered grid numerical methods. In this way, advantages of staggered methods carry over to collocated methods. The paper provides a number of new collocated schemes for linear acoustic/Maxwell equations that are inspired by the Yee scheme. They are then extended to an all-speed method for the full Euler equations on Cartesian grids. By taking the opposite view and taking inspiration from collocated methods, the paper also suggests a new way of staggering the variables which increases the stability as compared to the traditional Yee scheme.",

          "description": "Abstract\nProper orthogonal decomposition (POD) allows reduced-order modeling of complex dynamical systems at a substantial level, while maintaining a high degree of accuracy in modeling the underlying dynamical systems. Advances in machine learning algorithms enable learning POD-based dynamics from data and making accurate and fast predictions of dynamical systems. This paper extends the recently proposed heavy-ball neural ODEs (HBNODEs) (Xia et al. NeurIPS, 2021] for learning data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) in the POD context, in particular, for learning dynamics of time-varying coefficients generated by the POD analysis on training snapshots constructed by solving full-order models. HBNODE enjoys several practical advantages for learning POD-based ROMs with theoretical guarantees, including 1) HBNODE can learn long-range dependencies effectively from sequential observations, which is crucial for learning intrinsic patterns from sequential data, and 2) HBNODE is computationally efficient in both training and testing. We compare HBNODE with other popular ROMs on several complex dynamical systems, including the von Kármán Street flow, the Kurganov-Petrova-Popov equation, and the one-dimensional Euler equations for fluids modeling.",

Most of the existing numerical approximations for the DVWE are based on domain truncation with ad hoc boundary conditions. However, this would generate artificial reflections as well as truncation errors. To this end, we directly consider the DVWE in unbounded domains. We first show the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of the solution of the DVWE. We then develop a Hermite spectral Galerkin scheme and derive the corresponding error estimate showing that the Hermite spectral Galerkin approximation delivers a spectral rate of convergence provided sufficiently smooth solutions. Several numerical experiments with constant and discontinuous coefficients are provided to verify the theoretical result and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, We verify the error estimate for both smooth and non-smooth source terms and initial conditions. In view of the error estimate and the regularity result, we show the sharpness of the convergence rate in terms of the regularity of the source term. We also show that the artificial reflection does not occur by using the present method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a new Cartesian grid finite difference scheme is introduced for solving parabolic initial-boundary value problems involving irregular domains and Robin boundary condition in two and three dimensions. In spatial discretization, a ray-casting matched interface and boundary (MIB) method is utilized to enforce different types of boundary conditions, including Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and their mixed combinations, along the normal direction to generate necessary fictitious values outside the irregular domain. This allows accurate approximations of jumps in derivatives at various boundary locations so that the fourth-order central difference can be corrected at all Cartesian nodes. By treating such corrections as additional unknowns, the order of finite difference discretization of the Laplacian operator can be preserved. Moreover, by constructing corrections for different types of irregular and corner points, the proposed augmented MIB (AMIB) method can accommodate complicated geometries, while maintaining the fourth order of accuracy in space. In temporal discretization, the standard Crank–Nicolson scheme is employed, which is second-order in time and unconditionally stable. Furthermore, a Fast Sine Transform acceleration algorithm is employed to efficiently invert the discrete Laplacian, so that the augmented linear system in each time step can be solved with a complexity of \n                      \n                      \\(O(N \\log N)\\)\n                      \n                    , where N stands for the total spatial degree-of-freedom.

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a new well-balanced discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is proposed for the shallow water equations in the sense of moving-water equilibria preservation. The significant ingredient for the scheme is the approximation of the equilibrium variables in the DG piecewise polynomial space, rather than the conservative variables in most existing well-balanced schemes. Thus, the conservative variables are non-polynomial functions of the equilibrium variables. This approach is easily accomplished without the reference equilibrium state recovery and a special source term approximation. To obtain the moving water equilibrium preservation of the scheme, the strategy pursued is to modify the numerical fluxes based on the generalized hydrostatic reconstruction. A rigorous theoretical analysis proves the exact equilibrium preservation of the scheme. Numerical tests demonstrate that this DG method is high-order accurate, successfully maintains the still water and the generalized moving water equilibria states, and captures small perturbations of the hydrostatic state without numerical oscillations near shocks even on the discontinuous bottom topography.",

In this paper, we propose and validate a multiscale model for the description of particle diffusion in presence of trapping boundaries. We start from a drift-diffusion equation in which the drift term describes the effect of bubble traps and is modeled by a short-range potential with an attractive term and a repulsive core. The interaction of the particles attracted by the bubble surface is simulated by the Lennard–Jones potential that simplifies the capture due to the hydrophobic properties of the ions. In our model, the effect of the potential is replaced by a suitable boundary condition derived by mass conservation and asymptotic analysis. The potential is assumed to have a range of small size [math]. An asymptotic expansion in the [math] is considered, and the boundary conditions are obtained by retaining the lowest-order terms in the expansion. Another aspect we investigate is the saturation effect coming from high concentrations in the proximity of the bubble surface. The validity of the model is carefully checked with several tests in one and two dimensions and different geometries.",

This paper is concerned with the inverse elastic scattering problem for a random potential in three dimensions.

Given the potential, the direct scattering problem is shown to be well-posed in the sense of distributions by studying the equivalent Lippmann–Schwinger integral equation. For the inverse scattering problem, we demonstrate that the microlocal strength of the random potential can be uniquely determined with probability one by a single realization of the high frequency limit of the averaged compressional or shear backscattered far-field pattern of the scattered wave. The analysis employs the integral operator theory, the Born approximation in the high frequency regime, the microlocal analysis for the Fourier integral operators, and the ergodicity of the wave field.",

In the [math]-Consensus-Halving problem, a fundamental problem in fair division, there are [math] agents with valuations over the interval [0,1], and the goal is to divide the interval into pieces and assign a label “[math]” or “[math]” to each piece, such that every agent values the total amount of “[math]” and the total amount of “[math]” almost equally. The problem was recently proven by Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg [Proceedings of the 50th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2018, pp. 51–64; Proceedings of the 51st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2019, pp. 638–649] to be the first “natural” complete problem for the computational class PPA, answering a decade-old open question. In this paper, we examine the extent to which the problem becomes easy to solve if one restricts the class of valuation functions. To this end, we provide the following contributions. First, we obtain a strengthening of the PPA-hardness result of Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg [Proceedings of the 51st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2019, pp. 638–649] to the case when agents have piecewise uniform valuations with only two blocks. We obtain this result via a new reduction, which is in fact conceptually much simpler than the corresponding one in Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg [Proceedings of the 51st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2019, pp. 638–649]. Then, we consider the case of single-block (uniform) valuations and provide a parameterized polynomial-time algorithm for solving [math]-Consensus-Halving for any [math], as well as a polynomial-time algorithm for [math]. Finally, an important application of our new techniques is the first hardness result for a generalization of Consensus-Halving, the Consensus-[math]-Division problem [F. W. Simmons and F. E. Su, Math. Social Sci., 45 (2003), pp. 15–25]. In particular, we prove that [math]-Consensus-[math]-Division is PPAD-hard.",

A tensor network is a diagram that specifies a way to “multiply” a collection of tensors together to produce another tensor (or matrix). Many existing algorithms for tensor problems (such as tensor decomposition and tensor PCA), although they are not presented this way, can be viewed as spectral methods on matrices built from simple tensor networks. In this work we leverage the full power of this abstraction to design new algorithms for certain continuous tensor decomposition problems. An important and challenging family of tensor problems comes from orbit recovery, a class of inference problems involving group actions (inspired by applications such as cryo-electron microscopy). Orbit recovery problems over finite groups can often be solved via standard tensor methods. However, for infinite groups, no general algorithms are known. We give a new spectral algorithm based on tensor networks for one such problem: continuous multi-reference alignment over the infinite group SO(2).

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. We introduce a new technique for proving membership of problems in FIXP: the class capturing the complexity of computing a fixed point of an algebraic circuit. Our technique constructs a “pseudogate,” which can be used as a black box when building FIXP circuits. This pseudogate, which we term the “OPT-gate,” can solve most convex optimization problems. Using the OPT-gate, we prove new FIXP-membership results, and we generalize and simplify several known results from the literature on fair division, game theory, and competitive markets. In particular, we prove complexity results for two classic problems: Computing a market equilibrium in the Arrow–Debreu model with general concave utilities is in FIXP, and computing an envy-free division of a cake with very general valuations is FIXP-complete. We further showcase the wide applicability of our technique by using it to obtain simplified proofs and extensions of known FIXP-membership results for equilibrium computation for various types of strategic games as well as the pseudomarket mechanism of Hylland and Zeckhauser.",
