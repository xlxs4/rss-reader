The augmented subspace algorithm and the corresponding multilevel correction method are designed based on a coarse finite element space which is not the subset of the finer finite element space. The nonnested augmented subspace method can transform the eigenvalue problem-solving on the finest mesh to the solving linear equation on the same mesh and small scale eigenvalue problem on the low dimensional augmented subspace.

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we present a novel class of high-order energy-preserving schemes for solving the Zakharov-Rubenchik equations. The main idea of the scheme is first to introduce an quadratic auxiliary variable to transform the Hamiltonian energy into a modified quadratic energy and the original system is then reformulated into an equivalent system which satisfies the mass, modified energy as well as two linear invariants. The symplectic Runge-Kutta method in time, together with the Fourier pseudo-spectral method in space is employed to compute the solution of the reformulated system. The main benefit of the proposed schemes is that it can achieve arbitrarily high-order accurate in time and conserve the three invariants: mass, Hamiltonian energy and two linear invariants. In addition, an efficient fixed-point iteration is proposed to solve the resulting nonlinear equations of the proposed schemes. Several experiments are addressed to validate the theoretical results.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe introduce and analyze a very simple but efficient postprocessing technique for improving the accuracy of the continuous Galerkin (CG) time stepping method for nonlinear first-order initial value problems with smooth and singular solutions. The key idea of the postprocessing technique is to add a higher order Lobatto polynomial of degree \n                      \n                      \\(k+1\\)\n                      \n                     to the CG solution of degree k. We first establish global superconvergent error bounds for the postprocessed CG approximations over arbitrary time partitions, and as a by-product, it is shown that the convergence rates of the \n                      \n                      \\(L^2\\)\n                      \n                    -, \n                      \n                      \\(H^1\\)\n                      \n                    - and \n                      \n                      \\(L^\\infty \\)\n                      \n                    -estimates for the CG method with quasi-uniform meshes for smooth solutions are improved by one order. Moreover, for solutions with initial singularities, we prove that the optimal global error estimates and nodal superconvergent estimate can be obtained for the CG method with graded meshes, and after postprocessing, the convergence rates of the \n                      \n                      \\(L^2\\)\n                      \n                    -, \n                      \n                      \\(H^1\\)\n                      \n                    - and \n                      \n                      \\(L^\\infty \\)\n                      \n                    -estimates are also improved by one order.

          "description": "Abstract\nMembrane problems commonly encountered in engineering and biological applications involve large deformations and complex configurations. Immersed boundary (IB) method, formulated by the fluid equations in which the fluid-structure interaction is described in terms of the Dirac function, is one of the most powerful tools to simulate such problems. However, the IB method suffers from severe time step restrictions to maintain stability if the discretization lacks conservation of energy, especially for two-phase flows. In this paper, we develop an energy stable IB method for solving deformable membrane problems with non-uniform density and viscosity. Unlike the classic IB formulation, the evolution of membrane, including elastic tension and bending force, is controlled by its tangent angle and arc length. After minor modifications, it is shown that the model satisfies the continuous energy law. Thus, for the reformulated model, we proposed an implicit unconditionally energy stable scheme, where the energy of the scheme is proved to be dissipative. The resultant system is solved iteratively and the numerical results show that the proposed scheme is energy stable and capable of predicting the dynamics of extensible and inextensible interface problems with non-uniform density and viscosity.",

The aim of this work is to provide a stable and robust numerical method for a wide range of physical and numerical parameters.

In this paper, we present and analyze a different method by converting the integration path to the complex plane for this class of oscillatory infinite Bessel transform. In particular, we establish a series of new quadrature rules for this transform and carry out rigorous analysis, including the cases that the oscillator g(x) has either zeros or stationary points. The error analysis shows the advantages that this approach exhibits high asymptotic order, and the accuracy improves significantly as either the frequency \n                      \n                      \\(\\omega \\)\n                      \n                     or the number of nodes n increases.

In the latter case, we take advantage of the natural adjoint-like properties of generative models and the ability to simulate forwards and backwards in time. GANs have received much attention recently, after achieving excellent results for their generation of realistic-looking images. We wish to explore how this property translates to new applications in computational modelling and to exploit the adjoint-like properties for efficient data assimilation. We apply these methods to a compartmental model in epidemiology that is able to model space and time variations, and that mimics the spread of COVID-19 in an idealised town. To do this, the GAN is set within a reduced-order model, which uses a low-dimensional space for the spatial distribution of the simulation states. Then the GAN learns the evolution of the low-dimensional states over time. The results show that the proposed methods can accurately predict the evolution of the high-fidelity numerical simulation, and can efficiently assimilate observed data and determine the corresponding model parameters.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we present a pressure-based semi-implicit numerical scheme for a first order hyperbolic formulation of compressible two-phase flow with surface tension and viscosity. The numerical method addresses several complexities presented by the PDE system in consideration: (i) The presence of involution constraints of curl type in the governing equations requires explicit enforcement of the zero-curl property of certain vector fields (an interface field and a distortion field); the problem is solved by adopting a set of compatible discrete curl and gradient operators on a staggered grid, allowing to preserve the Schwarz identity of cross-derivatives exactly at the discrete level. (ii) Since the complexity of the studied PDE system does not allow the explicit computation of its exact eigenvalues, reliable and precise analytical estimates are provided. (iii) The evolution equations feature highly nonlinear stiff algebraic source terms which are used for the description of viscous interactions as emergent behaviour of an elasto-plastic solid in the stiff strain relaxation limit; such source terms are reliably integrated with a novel and very efficient semi-analytical technique proposed for the first time in this paper. (iv) In the low-Mach number regime, standard explicit density-based Godunov-type schemes lose efficiency and accuracy; the issue is addressed by means of a simple semi-implicit, pressure-based, split treatment of acoustic and non-acoustic waves, again using staggered grids that recover the implicit solution for a single scalar field (the pressure) through a sequence of symmetric-positive definite linear systems that can be efficiently solved via the conjugate gradient method.",

Since in general the first term is differentiable and the second one is convex, proximal gradient methods are very well suited to face such optimization problems. However, when dealing with large-scale machine learning issues, the computation of the full gradient of the differentiable term can be prohibitively expensive by making these algorithms unsuitable. For this reason, proximal stochastic gradient methods have been extensively studied in the optimization area in the last decade…",
