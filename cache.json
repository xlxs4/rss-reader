          "description": "Abstract\nA novel optimization procedure for the generation of stability polynomials of stabilized explicit Runge–Kutta methods is devised. Intended for semidiscretizations of hyperbolic partial differential equations, the herein developed approach allows the optimization of stability polynomials with more than hundred stages. A potential application of these high degree stability polynomials are problems with locally varying characteristic speeds as found for non-uniformly refined meshes and spatially varying wave speeds. To demonstrate the applicability of the stability polynomials we construct 2N-storage many-stage Runge–Kutta methods that match their designed second order of accuracy when applied to a range of linear and nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs with smooth solutions. These methods are constructed to reduce the amplification of round off errors which becomes a significant concern for these many-stage methods.",

The ETD-based explicit multi-step approximations and Fourier collocation spectral method are applied in time integration and spatial discretization of the corresponding equation, respectively. In particular, a second-order artificial stabilizing term, in the form of \n                      \n                      \\(A\\tau ^2\\frac{\\partial (\\varDelta ^2+1)u}{\\partial t}\\)\n                      \n                    , is added to ensure the energy stability. The long-time unconditional energy stability of the algorithm is established rigorously. In addition, error estimates in \n                      \n                      \\(\\ell ^\\infty (0,T;\\ell ^2)\\)\n                      \n                    -norm are derived, with a careful estimate of the aliasing error. Numerical examples are carried out to verify the theoretical results. The long-time simulation demonstrates the stability and the efficiency of the numerical method.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose a new positivity-preserving (new PP) technique for fifth-order finite volume unequal-sized WENO schemes when solving some extreme problems of compressible Euler equations on structured meshes. After spatial reconstruction in each time marching, a detective process is used to examine the positivity of density and pressure at some checking points in each target cell. If the negativity happens at one checking point, a new compression limiter is carried out to ensure that the modified polynomials can achieve the positivity of density and pressure in the whole target cell instead of only at some discrete points. This treatment is easily implemented, owing to a quick and simple way to overestimate the minimum and maximum values of the polynomials of density and pressure in the target cell. Some numerical experiments for classical extreme problems show that the proposed method has an advantage in computational efficiency and robustness in comparison to the classical positivity-preserving techniques (Zhang and Shu in J Comput Phys 229:8918–8934, 2010), since the CFL number of 0.6 is allowed for all tests in this paper.",

In brief, FLEEPS solves in linear time complexity the smallest few eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of the linear elastic eigenvalue problem originating from the finite difference discretization of the frequency-domain linear elastic wave equation. Notably, FLEEPS employs the weighted singular value decomposition based preconditioner to greatly improve the convergence rate of the conjugate gradient iteration, and uses the fast Fourier transform algorithm to accelerate this preconditioner times a vector, based on the structured decomposition of the dense unitary factor T of this preconditioner. Band structure calculations of several 3D isotropic PnCs are presented to showcase the capabilities of FLEEPS. The preliminary MATLAB implementation of FLEEPS is available at https://github.com/FAME-GPU/FLEEPS-MATLAB.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose a reduced-order modeling strategy for two-way Dirichlet–Neumann parametric coupled problems solved with domain-decomposition (DD) sub-structuring methods. We split the original coupled differential problem into two sub-problems with Dirichlet and Neumann interface conditions, respectively. After discretization by, e.g., the finite element method, the full-order model (FOM) is solved by Dirichlet–Neumann iterations between the two sub-problems until interface convergence is reached. We then apply the reduced basis (RB) method to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the solution of each sub-problem. Furthermore, we apply the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) at the interface level to achieve a fully reduced-order representation of the DD techniques implemented. To deal with non-conforming FE interface discretizations, we employ the INTERNODES method combined with the interface DEIM reduction. The reduced-order model (ROM) is then solved by sub-iterating between the two reduced-order sub-problems until the convergence of the approximated high-fidelity interface solutions. The ROM scheme is numerically verified on both steady and unsteady coupled problems, in the case of non-conforming FE interfaces.",

The resulting error functions are characterized as the unique solutions to an optimality system that is reformulated as a boundary value problem. With this formulation, reliable pointwise error estimates can be generated utilizing well-established techniques of defect control.

The noisy leaky integrate-and-fire (NLIF) model describes the voltage configurations of neuron networks with an interacting many-particles system at a microscopic level. When simulating neuron networks of large sizes, computing a coarse-grained mean-field Fokker–Planck equation solving the voltage densities of the networks at a macroscopic level practically serves as a feasible alternative in its high efficiency and credible accuracy when the interaction within the network remains relatively low. However, the macroscopic model fails to yield valid results of the networks when simulating considerably synchronous networks with active firing events. In this paper, we propose a multiscale solver for the NLIF networks, inheriting the macroscopic solver’s low cost and the microscopic solver’s high reliability. For each temporal step, the multiscale solver uses the macroscopic solver when the firing rate of the simulated network is low, while it switches to the microscopic solver when the firing rate tends to blow up. Moreover, the macroscopic and microscopic solvers are integrated with a high-precision switching algorithm to ensure the accuracy of the multiscale solver. The validity of the multiscale solver is analyzed from two perspectives: first, we provide practically sufficient conditions that guarantee the mean-field approximation of the macroscopic model and present rigorous numerical analysis on simulation errors when coupling the two solvers; second, the numerical performance of the multiscale solver is validated through simulating several large neuron networks, including networks with either instantaneous or periodic input currents which prompt active firing events over some time.",

Nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations play a major role in modeling large systems of interacting particles with a proved effectiveness in describing real world phenomena ranging from classical fields such as fluids and plasma to social and biological dynamics. Their mathematical formulation often has to face physical forces having a significant random component or with particles living in a random environment whose characterization may be deduced through experimental data and leading consequently to uncertainty-dependent equilibrium states. In this work, to address the problem of effectively solving stochastic Fokker–Planck systems, we will construct a new equilibrium preserving scheme through a micro-macro approach based on stochastic Galerkin methods. The resulting numerical method, contrarily to the direct application of a stochastic Galerkin projection in the parameter space of the unknowns of the underlying Fokker–Planck model, leads to a highly accurate description of the uncertainty-dependent large time behavior. Several numerical tests in the context of collective behavior for social and life sciences are presented to assess the validity of the present methodology against standard ones.",

We are interested in the resonant electromagnetic scattering by all-dielectric metasurfaces made of a two-dimensional lattice of nanoparticles with high refractive indices. In [Ammari, Li, and Zou, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 376 (2023), pp. 39–90], it has been shown that a single high-index nanoresonator can couple with the incident wave and exhibit a strong magnetic dipole response. Recent physics experiments reveal that when the particles are arranged in certain periodic configurations, they may have different anomalous scattering effects in the macroscopic scale, compared to the single-particle case. In this work, we shall develop a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the resonant behaviors of all-dielectric metasurfaces. We start with the characterization of subwavelength scattering resonances in such a periodic setting and their asymptotic expansions in terms of the refractive index of the nanoparticles. Then we show that real resonances always exist below the essential spectrum of the periodic Maxwell operator and that they are the simple poles of the scattering resolvent with the exponentially decaying resonant modes. By using group theory, we discuss the implications of the symmetry of the metasurface on the subwavelength band functions and their associated eigenfunctions. For the symmetric metasurfaces with the normal incidence, we use a variational method to show the existence of embedded eigenvalues (i.e., real subwavelength resonances embedded in the continuous radiation spectrum). Furthermore, we break the configuration symmetry either by introducing a small deformation of particles or by slightly deviating from the normal incidence and prove that Fano-type reflection and transmission anomalies can arise in both of these scenarios.",

It has become well known that the Koopman generators for control-affine systems also have affine dependence on the input, leading to convenient finite-dimensional bilinear approximations of the dynamics. Yet there are still two main obstacles that limit the scope of current approaches for approximating the Koopman generators of systems with actuation. First, the performance of existing methods depends heavily on the choice of basis functions over which the Koopman generator is to be approximated; and there is currently no universal way to choose them for systems that are not measure preserving. Second, if we do not observe the full state, then it becomes necessary to account for the dependence of the output time series on the sequence of supplied inputs when constructing observables to approximate Koopman operators. To address these issues, we write the dynamics of observables governed by the Koopman generator as a bilinear hidden Markov model and determine the model parameters using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The E step involves a standard Kalman filter and smoother, while the M step resembles control-affine dynamic mode decomposition for the generator. We demonstrate the performance of this method on three examples, including recovery of a finite-dimensional Koopman-invariant subspace for an actuated system with a slow manifold; estimation of Koopman eigenfunctions for the unforced Duffing equation; and model-predictive control of a fluidic pinball system based only on noisy observations of lift and drag.",

Competitive threshold-linear networks have long been known to exhibit multistability, where the activity of the network settles into one of potentially many steady states. In this work, we find conditions that guarantee the absence of steady states, while maintaining bounded activity. These conditions lead us to define a combinatorial family of competitive threshold-linear networks, parametrized by a simple directed graph. By exploring this family, we discover that threshold-linear networks are capable of displaying a surprisingly rich variety of nonlinear dynamics, including limit cycles, quasi-periodic attractors, and chaos. In particular, several types of nonlinear behaviors can co-exist in the same network. Our mathematical results also enable us to engineer networks with multiple dynamic patterns. Taken together, these theoretical and computational findings suggest that threshold-linear networks may be a valuable tool for understanding the relationship between network connectivity and emergent dynamics.",

For fast-slow systems, truncated ODEs describe the fast dynamics. We define compatibility classes as subsets of the state space, obtained by equating the conservation laws to constants. A set of conservation laws is complete when the corresponding compatibility classes contain a finite number of steady states. Complete sets of conservation laws can be used for model order reduction and for studying the multistationarity of the model. We provide algorithmic methods for computing linear, monomial, and polynomial conservation laws of polynomial ODE models and for testing their completeness. The resulting conservation laws and their completeness are either independent or dependent on the parameters. In the latter case, we provide parametric case distinctions.

Since moment systems consist of a high or even infinite number of coupled equations, an indispensable step in obtaining a low-dimensional representation that is amenable to further analysis is, in many cases, to select a moment closure. A moment closure consists of a set of approximations that express certain higher-order moments in terms of lower-order ones, so that applying those leads to a closed system of equations for only the lower-order moments. Closures are frequently found drawing on intuition and heuristics to come up with quantitatively good approximations. In contrast to that, we propose an alternative approach where we instead focus on closures giving rise to certain qualitative features, such as bifurcations. Importantly, this fundamental change of perspective provides one with the possibility of classifying moment closures rigorously in regard to these features. This makes the design and selection of closures more algorithmic, precise, and reliable. In this work, we carefully study the moment systems that arise in the mean-field descriptions of two widely known network dynamical systems, the SIS epidemic and the adaptive voter model. We derive conditions that any moment closure has to satisfy so that the corresponding closed systems exhibit the transcritical bifurcation that one expects in these systems coming from the stochastic particle model.",

The Kuramoto model is a classical mathematical model in the field of nonlinear dynamical systems that describes the evolution of coupled oscillators in a network that may reach a synchronous state. The relationship between the network’s topology and whether the oscillators synchronize is a central question in the field of synchronization, and random graphs are often employed as a proxy for complex networks. On the other hand, the random graphs on which the Kuramoto model is rigorously analyzed in the literature are homogeneous models and fail to capture the underlying geometric structure that appears in several examples. In this work, we leverage tools from random matrix theory, random graphs, and mathematical statistics to prove that the Kuramoto model on a random geometric graph on the sphere synchronizes with probability tending to one as the number of nodes tends to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous result for the Kuramoto model on random geometric graphs.",

This manuscript presents an analytic solution to a generalization of the Wiener–Hopf equation in two variables and with three unknown functions. This equation arises in many applications, for example, when solving the discrete Helmholtz equation associated with scattering on a domain with perpendicular boundary. The traditional Wiener–Hopf method is suitable for problems involving boundary data on co-linear semi-infinite intervals, not for boundaries at an angle. This significant extension will enable the analytical solution to a new class of problems with more boundary configurations. Progress is made by defining an underlining manifold that links the two variables. This allows one to meromorphically continue the unknown functions on this manifold and formulate a jump condition. As a result the problem is fully solvable in terms of Cauchy-type integrals, which is surprising since this is not always possible for this type of functional equation.",

In particular, we establish injectivity of the Fréchet derivative of the parameter-to-state map for a semidiscrete seismic inverse problem in the viscoelastic regime. Here the finite-dimensional parameter space is restricted to functions having global support in the propagation medium (the nonlocal case) and that are locally linearly independent. As a consequence, we deduce local conditional well-posedness of this nonlinear inverse problem. Furthermore, we show that the tangential cone condition holds, which is an essential prerequisite in the convergence analysis of a variety of inversion algorithms for nonlinear ill-posed problems.",

A weakly nonlinear stability analysis of isothermal Poiseuille flow in a fluid overlying porous domain is proposed and investigated in this article. The nonlinear interactions are studied by imposing finite amplitude disturbances to the classical model deliberated in Chang, Chen, and Straughan [J. Fluid Mech., 564 (2006), pp. 287–303]. The order parameter theory is used to ascertain the cubic Landau equation, and the regimes of instability for the bifurcations are determined henceforth. The well-established controlling parameters viz. the depth ratio [math] depth of fluid domain/depth of porous domain), the Beavers–Joseph constant [math], and the Darcy number [math] are inquired upon for the bifurcation phenomena. The imposed finite amplitude disturbances are viewed for bifurcations along the neutral stability curves and away from the critical point as a function of the wave number [math] and the Reynolds number [math]. The even-fluid-layer (porous) mode along the neutral stability curves correlates to the subcritical (supercritical) bifurcation phenomena. On perceiving the bifurcations as a function of [math] and [math] by moving away from the bifurcation/critical point, subcritical bifurcation is observed for increasing [math] and decreasing [math]. In contrast to only fluid flow through a channel, it is found that the inclusion of porous domain aids in the early appearance of subcritical bifurcation when [math]. A considerable difference between the computed skin friction coefficient for the base and the distorted state is observed for small (large) values of [math]. In addition, an intrinsic relation among the mode of instability, bifurcation phenomena, and secondary flow pattern is also observed.",

This work contributes to these tasks with the formulation and analysis of an optimal control problem for the Wigner equation, which describes the time evolution of the quasi-density function. For this purpose, two possible control mechanisms are considered, and, correspondingly, a detailed analysis in weighted Sobolev spaces for the controlled nonhomogeneous Wigner equation is presented.

A lubrication model can be used to describe the dynamics of a weakly volatile viscous fluid layer on a hydrophobic substrate. Thin layers of the fluid are unstable to perturbations and break up into slowly evolving interacting droplets. A reduced-order dynamical system is derived from the lubrication model based on the nearest-neighbor droplet interactions in the weak condensation limit. Dynamics for periodic arrays of identical drops and pairwise droplet interactions are investigated, providing insights into the coarsening dynamics of a large droplet system. Weak condensation is shown to be a singular perturbation, fundamentally changing the long-time coarsening dynamics for the droplets and the overall mass of the fluid in two additional regimes of long-time dynamics.",

This paper shows that there exist Reed–Solomon (RS) codes, over exponentially large finite fields in the code length, that are combinatorially list-decodable well beyond the Johnson radius, in fact almost achieving the list-decoding capacity. In particular, we show that for any [math] there exist RS codes with rate [math] that are list-decodable from radius of [math]. We generalize this result to list-recovery, showing that there exist [math]-list-recoverable RS codes with rate [math]. Along the way we use our techniques to give a new proof of a result of Blackburn on optimal linear perfect hash matrices, and strengthen it to obtain a construction of strongly perfect hash matrices. To derive the results in this paper we show a surprising connection of the above problems to graph theory, and in particular to the tree packing theorem of Nash-Williams and Tutte. We also state a new conjecture that generalizes the tree packing theorem to hypergraphs and show that if this conjecture holds, then there would exist RS codes that are optimally (nonasymptotically) list-decodable.",

In this paper, we consider a simple model of random temporal graph, obtained from an Erdős–Rényi random graph, [math], by considering a random permutation [math] of the edges and interpreting the ranks in [math] as presence times.

We consider the problem of embedding a subset of [math] into a low-dimensional Hamming cube in an almost isometric way. We construct a simple, data-oblivious, and computationally efficient map that achieves this task with high probability; we first apply a specific structured random matrix, which we call the double circulant matrix; using that a matrix requires linear storage and matrix-vector multiplication that can be performed in near-linear time. We then binarize each vector by comparing each of its entries to a random threshold, selected uniformly at random from a well-chosen interval. We estimate the number of bits required for this encoding scheme in terms of two natural geometric complexity parameters of the set: its Euclidean covering numbers and its localized Gaussian complexity. The estimate we derive turns out to be the best that one can hope for, up to logarithmic terms. The key to the proof is a phenomenon of independent interest: we show that the double circulant matrix mimics the behavior of the Gaussian matrix in two important ways. First, it maps an arbitrary set in [math] into a set of well-spread vectors. Second, it yields a fast near-isometric embedding of any finite subset of [math] into [math]. This embedding achieves the same dimension reduction as the Gaussian matrix in near-linear time, under an optimal condition—up to logarithmic factors—on the number of points to be embedded. This improves a well-known construction due to Ailon and Chazelle.",

We define and study reachability preservers, a graph-theoretic primitive that has been implicit in prior work on network design. Given a directed graph [math] and a set of demand pairs [math], a reachability preserver is a sparse subgraph [math] that preserves reachability between all demand pairs Our first contribution is a series of extremal bounds on the size of reachability preservers. Our main result states that, for an [math]-node graph and demand pairs of the form [math] for a small node subset [math], there is always a reachability preserver on [math] edges. We additionally give a lower bound construction demonstrating that this upper bound characterizes the settings in which [math] size reachability preservers are generally possible, in a large range of parameters. The second contribution of this paper is a new connection between extremal graph sparsification results and classical Steiner Network Design problems. Surprisingly, prior to this work, the osmosis of techniques between these two fields had been superficial. This allows us to improve the state of the art approximation algorithms for the most basic Steiner-type problem in directed graphs from the [math] of Chlamtáč et al. [Approximating spanners and directed steiner forest: Upper and lower bounds, in Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, SIAM, Philadelphia, 2017, pp. 534–553] to [math].",

The Schrijver graph [math] is defined as the subgraph of [math] induced by the collection of all [math]-subsets of [math] that do not include two consecutive elements modulo [math]. It is known that the chromatic number of both [math] and [math] is [math]. In the computational Kneser and Schrijver problems, we are given access to a coloring with [math] colors of the vertices of [math] and [math], respectively, and the goal is to find a monochromatic edge. We prove that the problems admit randomized algorithms with running time [math], hence they are fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the parameter [math]. The analysis involves structural results on intersecting families and on induced subgraphs of Kneser and Schrijver graphs. We also study the Agreeable-Set problem of assigning a small subset of a set of [math] items to a group of [math] agents, so that all agents value the subset at least as much as its complement.

We study the computational complexity of the problem [math] of counting [math]-vertex induced subgraphs of a graph [math] that satisfy a graph property [math]. Our main result establishes an exhaustive and explicit classification for all hereditary properties, including tight conditional lower bounds under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH): If a hereditary property [math] is true for all graphs, or if it is true only for finitely many graphs, then [math] is solvable in polynomial time. Otherwise, [math] is [math]-complete when parameterized by [math], and, assuming ETH, it cannot be solved in time [math] for any function [math]. This classification features a wide range of properties for which the corresponding detection problem (as classified by Khot and Raman [Theoret. Comput. Sci., 289 (2002), pp. 997–1008]) is tractable but counting is hard. Moreover, even for properties which are already intractable in their decision version, our results yield significantly stronger lower bounds for the counting problem. As an additional result, we also present an exhaustive and explicit parameterized complexity classification for all properties that are invariant under homomorphic equivalence. By covering one of the most natural and general notions of closure, namely, closure under vertex-deletion (hereditary), we generalize some of the earlier results on this problem. For instance, our results fully subsume and strengthen the existing classification of [math] for monotone (subgraph-closed) properties due to Roth, Schmitt, and Wellnitz [SIAM J.
