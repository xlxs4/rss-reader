Different from the existing multigrid methods for multilevel block Toeplitz systems, we aggregate a given multilevel block Toeplitz matrix to a new multilevel Toeplitz matrix in such a way that a very sparse coarse grid matrix is constructed in practice. Then, we give an asymptotically tight bound of the convergence rate and provide an algorithm for selecting the optimal prolongation vector and the relaxation factor for our method. Numerical experiments on artificial examples are provided for visualizing the correctness of our analysis, while experiments associated with practical examples show the efficiency of our method in terms of computing time.",

The formulation of the time–dependent poroelasticity equations uses displacement, fluid pressure and total pressure, and the elasticity equations are written in displacement-pressure formulation. The construction of the virtual element scheme does not require Lagrange multipliers to impose the transmission conditions (continuity of displacement and total traction, and no-flux for the fluid) on the interface. We show the stability and convergence of the virtual element method for different polynomial degrees, and the error bounds are robust with respect to delicate model parameters (such as Lamé constants, permeability, and storativity coefficient).

          "description": "Abstract\nElectrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is widely applied in medical diagnosis, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Combining the physical principles of the imaging system with the advantages of data-driven deep learning networks, physics-embedded deep unrolling networks have recently emerged as a promising solution in computational imaging. However, the inherent nonlinear and ill-posed properties of EIT image reconstruction still present challenges to existing methods in terms of accuracy and stability. To tackle this challenge, we propose the learned half-quadratic splitting (HQSNet) algorithm for incorporating physics into learning-based EIT imaging. We then apply Anderson acceleration (AA) to the HQSNet algorithm, denoted as AA-HQSNet, which can be interpreted as AA applied to the Gauss-Newton step and the learned proximal gradient descent step of the HQSNet, respectively. AA is a widely-used technique for accelerating the convergence of fixed-point iterative algorithms and has gained significant interest in numerical optimization and machine learning. However, the technique has received little attention in the inverse problems community thus far. Employing AA enhances the convergence rate compared to the standard HQSNet while simultaneously avoiding artifacts in the reconstructions. Lastly, we conduct rigorous numerical and visual experiments to show that the AA module strengthens the HQSNet, leading to robust, accurate, and considerably superior reconstructions compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our Anderson acceleration scheme to enhance HQSNet is generic and can be applied to improve the performance of various physics-embedded deep learning methods.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper proposes a unified approach for pricing discretely monitored floating and fixed strike Asian options under a broad class of regime-switching and stochastic volatility models with jumps. The randomness in volatility can be either characterized by regime switching among discrete market states, a diffusive stochastic variance process correlated with the underlying asset price, or a random time change applied to a background process. Our approach can be applied to price financial derivatives with exotic averaging type payoffs, which goes beyond most of the existing frameworks in terms of versatility. Our success relies on the adoption of the change-of-measure approach and a dimension reduction technique. Specifically, we construct new backward recursions for Asian options that include floating and fixed strike payoffs under a wide range of regime-switching and stochastic volatility models with jumps. The Fourier-cosine series expansion and Gauss quadrature rule are applied to solve the backward recursions. The exponential convergence rate of our approach is proven theoretically and verified numerically via comprehensive error analysis. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach is reliable, accurate, and efficient.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe introduce a robust numerical strategy for the numerical simulation of several free-boundary problems arising in the study of nonlinear wave–structure interactions in shallow-water flows. We investigate two types of boundary-evolution equations: (1) a kinematic-type equation, associated with the interaction of waves with a moving lateral wall, (2) a fully-nonlinear singular equation modeling the evolution of the interface between a solid obstacle placed on the surface and the fluid. At the continuous level, the flow is globally modeled with the hyperbolic Nonlinear Shallow-Water (NSW) equations, including varying topography, and at the discrete level, an arbitrary-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is stabilized with a Local Subcell Correction (LSC) method. Mimicking the theoretical study of the continuous problem, suitable diffeomorphisms are introduced to recast the moving-boundary problems into fixed-boundary ones, and to compute the boundary’s evolution through an Arbitrary-Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) description. For any order of polynomial approximation, the resulting global algorithm is shown to: (1) preserve the Discrete Geometric Conservation Law (DGCL), (2) ensure the preservation of the water height positivity at the sub-cell level, (3) preserve the class of motionless steady-states (well-balancing), possibly with the occurrence of a partly immersed obstacle. Several numerical computations highlight that the proposed strategy: (1) effectively approximates the new free-boundary IBVPs introduced in Iguchi and Lannes (Indiana Univ Math J 70:353–464, 2021), (2) is able to accurately handle strong flow singularities without any robustness issues, (3) retains the highly accurate subcell resolution of DG schemes.",

In this paper, we study two-grid preconditioners for three-dimensional single-phase nonlinear compressible flow in highly heterogeneous porous media arising from reservoir simulation. Our goal is to develop robust and efficient preconditioners that converge independently of the contrast of the media and types of boundary conditions and source term. This is accomplished by constructing coarse space that can capture important features of the local heterogeneous media. To detect these features, local eigenvalue problems are defined and eigenvectors are adaptively selected to form the coarse space. The coarse space just needs to be constructed only once with parallel computing, although the compressible flow is a time-dependent problem and the permeability field changes in different time steps. Smoothers such as Gauss–Seidel iteration and ILU(0) are used to remove high-frequency errors. We analyze this preconditioner by proving the smoothing property and approximation property. In particular, a new coarse interpolation operator is defined to facilitate the analysis. Extensive numerical experiments with different types of large-scale heterogeneous permeability fields and boundary conditions are provided to show the impressive performance of the proposed preconditioner.",

The distinct timescales of synaptic plasticity and neural activity dynamics play an important role in the brain’s learning and memory systems. Activity-dependent plasticity reshapes neural circuit architecture, determining spontaneous and stimulus-encoding spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity. Neural activity bumps maintain short term memories of continuous parameter values, emerging in spatially organized models with short-range excitation and long-range inhibition. Previously, we demonstrated nonlinear Langevin equations derived using an interface method which accurately describe the dynamics of bumps in continuum neural fields with separate excitatory/inhibitory populations. Here we extend this analysis to incorporate effects of short term plasticity that dynamically modifies connectivity described by an integral kernel. Linear stability analysis adapted to these piecewise smooth models with Heaviside firing rates further indicates how plasticity shapes the bumps’ local dynamics. Facilitation (depression), which strengthens (weakens) synaptic connectivity originating from active neurons, tends to increase (decrease) stability of bumps when acting on excitatory synapses. The relationship is inverted when plasticity acts on inhibitory synapses. Multiscale approximations of the stochastic dynamics of bumps perturbed by weak noise reveal that the plasticity variables evolve to slowly diffusing and blurred versions of their stationary profiles. Nonlinear Langevin equations associated with bump positions or interfaces coupled to slowly evolving projections of plasticity variables accurately describe how these smoothed synaptic efficacy profiles can tether or repel wandering bumps.",

Traditional sensitivity analysis methods fail for chaotic systems due to the unstable characteristics of the linearized equations. To overcome these issues two methods have been developed in the literature, one being the shadowing approach, which results in a minimization problem, and the other being numerical viscosity, where a damping term is added to the linearized equations to suppress the instability. The shadowing approach is computationally expensive but produces accurate sensitivities, while numerical viscosity can produce less accurate sensitivities but with significantly reduced computational cost. However, it is not fully clear how the solutions generated by these two approaches compare to each other. In this work we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a control term, found with optimal control theory techniques, to prevent the exponential growth of solution of the linearized equations. We will refer to this method as optimal control shadowing. We investigate the computational aspects and performance of this new method on the Lorenz and Kuramoto–Sivashinsky systems and compare its performance with simple numerical viscosity schemes. We show that the tangent solution generated by the proposed approach is similar to that generated by shadowing methods, suggesting that optimal control attempts to stabilize the unstable shadowing direction. Further, for the spatially extended system, we examine the energy budget of the tangent equation and show that the control term found via the solution of the optimal control problem acts only at length scales where production of tangent energy dominates dissipation, which is not necessarily the case for the numerical viscosity methods.",

We propose a general strategy for reduced order modeling of systems that display highly nonlinear oscillations. By considering a continuous family of forced periodic orbits defined in relation to a stable fixed point and subsequently leveraging phase-amplitude-based reduction strategies, we arrive at a low order model capable of accurately capturing nonlinear oscillations resulting from arbitrary external inputs. In the limit that oscillations are small, the system dynamics relax to those obtained from local linearization, i.e., that can be fully described using linear eigenmodes. For larger amplitude oscillations, the behavior can be understood in terms of the dynamics of a small number of nonlinear modes. We illustrate the proposed strategy in a variety of examples yielding results that are substantially better than those obtained using standard linearization-based techniques.",

The GP predictive distribution provides a lower bound on the confidence that these topological invariants, and hence the characterized dynamics, apply to the unknown dynamical system (assumed to be a sample path of the GP).

This paper is mainly concerned with limiting behaviors of invariant measures for neural field lattice models in a random environment. First of all, we consider the convergence relation of invariant measures between the stochastic neural field lattice model and the corresponding deterministic model in weighted spaces, and prove any limit of a sequence of invariant measures of such a lattice model must be an invariant measure of its limiting system as the noise intensity tends to zero. Then we are devoted to studying the numerical approximation of invariant measures of such a stochastic neural lattice model. To this end, we first consider convergence of invariant measures between such a neural lattice model and the system with neurons only interacting with its n-neighborhood; then we further prove the convergence relation of invariant measures between the system with an n-neighborhood and its finite dimensional truncated system. By this procedure, the invariant measure of the stochastic neural lattice models can be approximated by the numerical invariant measure of a finite dimensional truncated system based on the backward Euler–Maruyama (BEM) scheme. Therefore, the invariant measure of a deterministic neural field lattice model can be observed by the invariant measure of the BEM scheme when the noise is not negligible.",

Generalized mass-action systems are power-law dynamical systems arising from chemical reaction networks. Essentially, every nonnegative ODE model used in chemistry and biology (for example, in ecology and epidemiology) and even in economics and engineering can be written in this form. Previous results have focused on existence and uniqueness of special steady states (complex-balanced equilibria) for all rate constants, thereby ruling out multiple (special) steady states. Recently, necessary conditions for linear stability have been obtained. In this work, we provide sufficient conditions for the linear stability of complex-balanced equilibria for all rate constants (and also for the nonexistence of other steady states). In particular, via sign vector conditions (on the stoichiometric coefficients and kinetic orders), we guarantee that the Jacobian matrix is a [math]-matrix. Technically, we use a new decomposition of the graph Laplacian which allows us to consider orders of (generalized) monomials. Alternatively, we use cycle decomposition which allows a linear parametrization of all Jacobian matrices. In any case, we guarantee stability without explicit computation of steady states. We illustrate our results in examples from chemistry and biology: generalized Lotka–Volterra systems and SIR models, a two-component signaling system, and an enzymatic futile cycle.",

Model reduction of fast-slow chemical reaction networks based on the quasi-steady state approximation fails when the fast subsystem has first integrals. We call these first integrals approximate conservation laws. In order to define fast subsystems and identify approximate conservation laws, we use ideas from tropical geometry. We prove that any approximate conservation law evolves more slowly than all the species involved in it and therefore represents a supplementary slow variable in an extended system. By elimination of some variables of the extended system, we obtain networks without approximate conservation laws, which can be reduced by standard singular perturbation methods. The field of applications of approximate conservation laws covers the quasi-equilibrium approximation, which is well known in biochemistry. We discuss reductions of slow-fast as well as multiple timescale systems. Networks with multiple timescales have hierarchical relaxation. At a given timescale, our multiple timescale reduction method defines three subsystems composed of (i) slaved fast variables satisfying algebraic equations, (ii) slow driving variables satisfying reduced ordinary differential equations, and (iii) quenched much slower variables that are constant. The algebraic equations satisfied by fast variables define chains of nested normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds. In such chains, faster manifolds are of higher dimension and contain the slower manifolds. Our reduction methods are introduced algorithmically for networks with monomial reaction rates and linear, monomial, or polynomial approximate conservation laws. We propose symbolic algorithms to reshape and rescale the networks such that geometric singular perturbation theory can be applied to them, test the applicability of the theory, and finally reduce the networks. As a proof of concept, we apply this method to a model of the TGF-beta signaling pathway.",

The interval delay is determined by two delay parameters, namely delay center and delay radius. We derive the basic reproduction number [math] for the viral infection and obtain that the virus-free equilibrium (VFE) is globally asymptotically stable if [math]. When [math], besides VFE, the unique virus-present equilibrium (VPE) exists and the conditions of its asymptotical stability are obtained. Moreover, we study the Hopf bifurcations induced by the two delay parameters. Although there is no mitotic term in the target-cell dynamics, the results indicate that both these delay parameters can lead to periodic fluctuations at VPE, but only the smaller delay radius will destabilize the system, which is different from the classical discrete delay or distributed delay. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed model can capture the profiles of the clinical data of two untreated chronic hepatitis B patients. The ability of interval delay to destabilize the system is between discrete delay and distributed delay, and the delay center plays the primary role. Pharmaceutical treatment can affect the stability of VPE and induce the fast-slow periodic phenomenon.",

We discuss Liapunov, asymptotic, and Floquet stability of the lifted periodic orbit and introduce transverse versions of these conditions that imply stability for signals propagating along arbitrarily long chains.

Microbes are able to deploy different strategies in response to, and depending upon, local environmental conditions. In the setting of a microbial community, this property induces a Nash equilibrium problem because access to environmental resources is bounded. If microbes are also distributed in space, then those resources are subject to transport limitations (encoded in a PDE) and so microbial strategies at one location influence resources and, hence, microbial strategies, at another. Here we formulate the resulting PDE-coupled generalized Nash equilibrium problem for a multispecies biofilm community, and propose a domain-decomposition-based method for its solution. An example consisting of a model with two microbial species biofilm with 33 externally transported chemical concentrations is presented.",

This article presents a new method to reconstruct slowly varying width defects in two-dimensional waveguides using one-side section measurements at locally resonant frequencies. At these frequencies, locally resonant modes propagate in the waveguide up to a “cut-off” position. In this particular point, the local width of the waveguide can be recovered. Given multifrequency data measured on a section of the waveguide, we perform an efficient layer stripping approach to recover, section by section, the shape variations. It provides an L infinity-stable method to reconstruct the width of a slowly monotonous varying waveguide. We validate this method on numerical data and discuss its limits.",

Critical Reynolds numbers for the monotone exponential energy stability of Couette and Poiseuille plane flows were obtained by Orr in 1907 [Proc. Roy. Irish Acad. A, 27 (1907), pp. 9–68, 69–138] in a famous paper, and by Joseph in 1966 [J. Fluid Mech., 33 (1966), pp. 617–621], Joseph and Carmi in 1969 [Quart. Appl. Math., 26 (1969), pp. 575–579], and Busse in 1972 [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 47 (1972), pp. 28–35]. All these authors obtained their results applying variational methods to compute the maximum of a functional ratio derived from the Reynolds–Orr energy identity. Orr and Joseph obtained different results; for instance, in the Couette case Orr computed the critical Reynolds value of 44.3 (on spanwise perturbations) and Joseph 20.65 (on streamwise perturbations). Recently in [P. Falsaperla, G. Mulone, and C. Perrone, Eur. J. Mech. B Fluids, 93 (2022), pp. 93–100], the authors conjectured that the search of the maximum should be restricted to a subspace of the space of kinematically admissible perturbations. With this conjecture, the critical nonlinear energy Reynolds number was found among spanwise perturbations (a Squire theorem for nonlinear systems). With a direct proof and an appropriate and original decomposition of the dissipation terms in the Reynolds–Orr identity we show the validity of this conjecture in the space of three-dimensional perturbations.",

We identify a taxonomic property on the growth functions in the multispecies chemostat model which ensures the coexistence of a subset of species under periodic removal rate. We show that proportions of some powers of the species densities are periodic functions, leading to an infinity of distinct neutrally stable periodic orbits depending on the initial condition. This condition on the species for neutral stability possesses the feature to be independent of the shape of the periodic signal for a given mean value. We also give conditions allowing the coexistence of two distinct subsets of species. Although these conditions are nongeneric, we show in simulations that when these conditions are only approximately satisfied, the behavior of the solutions is close to that of the nongeneric case over a long time interval, justifying the interest of our study.",

Here we show the following strengthening: let [math] be [math]-recognizable, and let [math] be [math]-recognizable such that both [math] and [math] are not definable in Presburger arithmetic. Then the first-order logical theory of [math] is undecidable. This is in contrast to a well-known theorem of Büchi stating that the first-order logical theory of [math] is decidable.",
