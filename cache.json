          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, a modified a posteriori limiter is developed for high order flux reconstruction (FR) scheme for the numerical simulation of detonation problems. In this limiting procedure, the unlimited FR solution at the new time step will be checked first by using some detection criteria, then the solution in the troubled cells are recomputed with a robust subcell finite volume (FV) scheme. The detection criteria for identifying troubled cells consist of the physical admissibility (e.g., positivity of density and pressure) and numerical admissibility (e.g., non-oscillating). We modify the detection criteria by using the KXRCF shock detector prior to the relaxed discrete maximum principle. This can track the troubled cells near strong shocks consecutively so as to improve the steady state convergence and can reduce the number of overly marked troubled cells. The subcell correction procedure endows the high order FR scheme the capability to capture discontinuities inside a cell without generating spurious oscillations. A series of one-dimensional numerical tests are carried out to assess the effectiveness of the proposed limiter. In particular, one-dimensional detonation wave problems with the overdriven factor f = 1.8–1.3 are calculated using third to sixth order accurate FR schemes in conjunction with the first order Godunov or second order TVD subcell FV scheme. It is shown that the FR schemes with the present a posteriori limiter can compute strong detonation waves robustly, and the third order FR scheme with the second order TVD subcell FV limiter has better resolution of detonation waves compared with the fifth order WENO-Z scheme under same degree of freedoms.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper aims to propose a complete superconvergence analysis for a postprocessing technique based on collocation methods for fractional differential equations (FDEs). We start with the simple linear FDEs with Caputo derivative of order \n                      \n                      \\(0<\\alpha <1\\)\n                      \n                    . The problem is reformulated as a weakly singular Volterra integral equation (VIE), and based on the resolvent theory of VIEs, the existence, uniqueness and regularity for the exact solution for the original FDE are obtained. Then the piecewise polynomial collocation method is adopted to solve the reformulated VIE, and based on the regularity of the original FDE, the convergence for the collocation method and the superconvergence for the iterated collocation method are investigated in detail, respectively. Further, based on the obtained collocation solution, the interpolation postprocessing approximation of higher accuracy is constructed on graded mesh, and the superconvergence is obtained. Compared with classical iterated collocation method, the cost on computation of interpolation postprocessing technique is less. Numerical experiments are given to illustrate the theoretical results, and it is also shown that the proposed postprocessing technique can be extended to certain nonlinear and systems of FDEs.",

Using classical potential theory, the Laplace–Beltrami operator can be pre-/post-conditioned with an integral operator whose kernel is translation invariant, resulting in well-conditioned Fredholm integral equations of the second-kind. These equations have the standard 1/r kernel from potential theory, and therefore the equations can be solved rapidly and accurately using a combination of fast multipole methods (FMMs) and high-order quadrature corrections. In this work we detail such a scheme, presenting two alternative integral formulations of the Laplace–Beltrami problem, each of whose solution can be obtained via FMM acceleration. We then present several applications of the solvers, focusing on the computation of what are known as harmonic vector fields, relevant for many applications in electromagnetics. A battery of numerical results are presented for each application, detailing the performance of the solver in various geometries.",

Differently from a commonly used contour integral-based FEAST solver, we propose a robust alternative that constructs approximate spectral projectors by using the Chebyshev–Jackson polynomial series, which are shown to be symmetric positive semi-definite with the eigenvalues in [0, 1]. We prove the pointwise convergence of this series and give compact estimates for pointwise errors of it and the step function that corresponds to the exact spectral projector of interest. We present error bounds for the approximate spectral projector and reliable estimates for the number of desired singular triplets, prove the convergence of the resulting FEAST SVDsolver, and propose practical selection strategies for determining the series degree and the subspace dimension. The solver and results on it are directly applicable or adaptable to the real symmetric and complex Hermitian eigenvalue problem. Numerical experiments illustrate that the FEAST SVDsolver is substantially more efficient than the contour integral-based FEAST SVDsolver, and it is also more robust and stable than the latter.",

The centered finite difference is taken as the spatial discretization. Meanwhile, the highly nonlinear and singular nature of the logarithmic energy potentials has always been the essential difficulty to design a second order accurate scheme in time, while preserving the variational energetic structures. The mobility function is updated with a second order accurate extrapolation formula, for the sake of unique solvability. A modified Crank–Nicolson scheme is used to approximate the logarithmic term, so that its inner product with the discrete temporal derivative exactly gives the corresponding nonlinear energy difference; henceforth the energy stability is ensured for the logarithmic part. In addition, nonlinear artificial regularization terms are added in the numerical scheme, so that the positivity-preserving property could be theoretically proved, with the help of the singularity associated with the logarithmic function. Furthermore, an optimal rate convergence analysis is provided in this paper, in which the higher order asymptotic expansion for the numerical solution, the rough error estimate and refined error estimate techniques have to be included to accomplish such an analysis. This work combines the following theoretical properties for a second order accurate numerical scheme for the PNP system: (i) second order accuracy in both time and space, (ii) unique solvability and positivity, (iii) energy stability, and (iv) optimal rate convergence.

In this paper, a multiscale constitutive framework for one-dimensional blood flow modeling is presented and discussed. By analyzing the asymptotic limits of the proposed model, it is shown that different types of blood propagation phenomena in arteries and veins can be described through an appropriate choice of scaling parameters, which are related to distinct characterizations of the fluid-structure interaction mechanism (whether elastic or viscoelastic) that exist between vessel walls and blood flow. In these asymptotic limits, well-known blood flow models from the literature are recovered. Additionally, by analyzing the perturbation of the local elastic equilibrium of the system, a new viscoelastic blood flow model is derived. The proposed approach is highly flexible and suitable for studying the human cardiovascular system, which is composed of vessels with high morphological and mechanical variability. The resulting multiscale hyperbolic model of blood flow is solved using an asymptotic-preserving implicit-explicit Runge–Kutta finite volume method, which ensures the consistency of the numerical scheme with the different asymptotic limits of the mathematical model without affecting the choice of the time step by restrictions related to the smallness of the scaling parameters. Several numerical tests confirm the validity of the proposed methodology, including a case study investigating the hemodynamics of a thoracic aorta in the presence of a stent.",

Following the paper of Bostan and Finot [Commun. Contemp.

In this work, we consider a Particle-in-Cell discretization of the collisional Vlasov system which enables us to deal with the multiscale characteristics equations. Different multiscale time integrators are then constructed and analyzed. We prove asymptotic properties of these schemes in the highly oscillatory regime and in the collisional regime. In particular, the asymptotic preserving property towards the modified equilibrium of the averaged collision operator is recovered. Numerical experiments are then shown to illustrate the properties of the numerical schemes.",

In this paper, we study a tumor-immune system interaction model with dendritic cell therapy and immune response delay. First, it is shown that the ODE version of the model has a Bogdanov–Takens (BT) singularity or a weak focus with multiplicity at most 1 for different parameter values. As the parameters vary, the ODE model undergoes supercritical Hopf bifurcation and supercritical BT bifurcation. Our analysis indicates that there exists a threshold value of the activation rate of T cells, below which tumor immune escape occurs, above or at which T cells and tumor cells coexist in the form of a stable periodic oscillation or steady state. Second, we study how the immune response delay affects the dynamics of the model. Our results reveal that the delay can destabilize the stable positive equilibrium through Hopf bifurcation. Furthermore, the direction and stability of Hopf bifurcation are derived. When there is a cusp, we show that it is a BT singularity for any delay and the delay model also undergoes BT bifurcation.

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. This work addresses the modelling of oxygenic photogranules (OPGs), by introducing a mathematical model which describes both the genesis and growth of photogranules and the related treatment process. The photogranule has been modelled as a free boundary domain with radial symmetry, which evolves over time as a result of microbial growth, attachment, and detachment processes. Hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs have been considered to model at mesoscale the transport and growth of sessile biomass and the diffusion and conversion of soluble substrates. The macroscale behavior of the system has been modelled through first order impulsive ordinary differential equations (IDEs), which reproduce a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) configuration. Phototrophic biomass has been considered for the first time in granular biofilms, and cyanobacteria and microalgae have been accounted separately, to model their metabolic differences. To describe the key role of cyanobacteria in the photogranulation process, the attachment velocity of all suspended microbial species has been modelled as a function of the cyanobacteria concentration in suspended form. The model takes into account the main biological processes involved in OPG-based systems: metabolic activity of cyanobacteria, microalgae, heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria, microbial decay, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secretion, symbiotic and competitive interactions between different species, light-dark cycle, light attenuation across the granule, and photoinhibition phenomena. The model has been integrated numerically, and the results show its consistency in describing the photogranule evolution and ecology, and highlight the advantages of the OPG technology, analyzing the effects of the influent wastewater composition and light conditions on the process.",

We examine network topologies that minimize [math] and provide proofs of optimality for some cases and numerical evidence of optimality for others. Finally, we present greedy algorithms that add edges to and delete edges from a network to reduce [math], and we apply these algorithms to a network that we construct using a supermarket store layout.

Random walks represent an important tool for probing the structural and dynamical properties of networks and modeling transport and diffusion processes on networks. However, when individuals’ movements become dictated by more complicated factors, e.g., scenarios that involve complex decision making, the linear paradigm of classical random walks lacks the ability to capture dynamically rich behaviors. One modification that addresses this issue is to allow transition probabilities to depend on the current system state, resulting in a nonlinear random walk. While the resulting nonlinearity has been shown to give rise to an array of more complex dynamics, the patterns that emerge, in particular on regular network topologies, remain unexplored and poorly understood. Here we study nonlinear random walks on regular networks. We present a number of stability results for the uniform state where random walkers are uniformly distributed throughout the network, characterizing the spectral properties of its Jacobian which we use to characterize its bifurcations. These spectral properties may also be used to understand the patterns that emerge beyond bifurcations, which consist of oscillating short wavelength patterns and localized structures for negative and positive bias, respectively. We also uncover a subcriticality in the bifurcation for positive bias, leading to a hysteresis loop and multistability.",

Based on reasonable assumptions on the medium properties, we derive a two-dimensional neural-signaling model in cylindrical coordinates from the time-harmonic Maxwell equations. The well-posedness of the model is established upon Dirichlet boundary conditions at the two ends of the neural structure and the radiative condition in the radial direction of the structure. Using the perfectly matched layer (PML) method, we truncate the unbounded background medium and propose an approximate problem on the truncated domain. The well-posedness of the PML problem and the exponential convergence of the approximate solution to the exact solution are established.

Since the seminal PPAD-completeness result for computing a Nash equilibrium even in two-player games, an important line of research has focused on relaxations achievable in polynomial time. In this paper, we consider the notion of an [math]-well-supported Nash equilibrium, where [math] corresponds to the approximation guarantee. Put simply, in an [math]-well-supported equilibrium, every player chooses with positive probability actions that are within [math] of the maximum achievable payoff against the other player’s strategy. Ever since the initial approximation guarantee of 2/3 for well-supported equilibria, which was established more than a decade ago, the progress on this problem has been extremely slow and incremental. Notably, the small improvements to 0.6608, and finally to 0.6528, were achieved by algorithms of growing complexity. Our main result is a simple and intuitive algorithm that improves the approximation guarantee to 1/2. Our algorithm is based on linear programming and in particular on exploiting suitably defined zero-sum games that arise from the payoff matrices of the two players. As a byproduct, we show how to achieve the same approximation guarantee in a query-efficient way.",
