          "description": "Advances in bacterial engineering have catalysed the development of living cell diagnostics and therapeutics, including microbes that respond to gut inflammation, intestinal bleeding, pathogens and hypoxic tumors. Bacteria can access the entire gastrointestinal tract to produce outputs measured in stool or urine. Cellular memory, such as bistable switches or genomic rearrangements11, allows bacteria to store information over time. However, living biosensors have not yet been engineered to detect specific DNA sequences or mutations from outside the cell. Here, we engineer naturally competent Acinetobacter baylyi to detect donor DNA from the genomes of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, organoids and tumors. We characterize the functionality of the biosensors in vitro with co-culture assays and then validate in vivo with sensor bacteria delivered to mice harboring colorectal tumors. We observe horizontal gene transfer from the tumor to the sensor bacteria in our mouse model of CRC. The sensor bacteria achieved 100% discrimination between mice with and without CRC. This Cellular Assay of Targeted, CRISPR-discriminated Horizontal gene transfer (CATCH), establishes a framework for biosensing of mutations or organisms within environments that are difficult to sample, among many other potential applications. Furthermore, the platform could be readily expanded to include production and delivery of antibiotic or antineoplastic therapeutic payloads at the detection site.",

Humans and their native gut microbiota lack erythritol catabolic microorganisms to utilize erythritol as carbon source, which inspires us to engineer a model chassis that can respond and utilize erythritol for establishing wide applications in synthetic biology fields. Here, we successfully engineered Escherichia coli to respond and utilize erythritol as sole carbon source. First, a heterologous erythritol catabolic gene cluster from Ochrobactrum spp. enables E. coli to catabolize erythritol into erythrose-4-phosphate and flow into pentose-phosphate pathway. Second, we characterized an erythritol binding transcriptional repressor and its DNA binding site. Then, mRNA transcriptional analysis guided us to build up further metabolic engineering strategies for improving erythritol catabolism. Finally, such engineered E. coli strains were applied for in vitro simulated intestinal fluid experiments and performed as an erythritol detector to distinguish soda drinks. We anticipate erythritol catabolic E. coli strains will expand synthetic biology fields and accelerate applications in biomedical engineering and living therapeutics.",

Intending to address one of the central design principles of the Sc2.0 project, the ~190 kb tRNA neochromosome houses all 275 relocated nuclear tRNA genes. To maximize stability, the design incorporated orthogonal genetic elements from non-S. cerevisiae yeast species. Furthermore, the presence of 283 rox recombination sites enable an orthogonal SCRaMbLE system capable of adjusting tRNA abundance. Following construction, we obtained evidence of a potent selective force once the neochromosome was introduced into yeast cells, manifesting as a spontaneous doubling in cell ploidy. Furthermore, tRNA sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics, nucleosome mapping, replication profiling, FISH and Hi-C were undertaken to investigate questions of tRNA neochromosome behavior and function. Its construction demonstrates the remarkable tractability of the yeast model and opens up new opportunities to directly test hypotheses surrounding these essential non-coding RNAs.",

Here we reported a hybrid system, coupling chemical process of CO2 hydrogen reduction and biological process for polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis, that utilized CO2 as a raw material to produce PHB in vitro. The synthetic pathway of PHB was optimized by screening more efficient methanol oxidases, high activity mutants of glycolaldehyde synthase and coordinating enzyme dosages in the pathway, which achieved the carbon yield of 93.6% for producing PHB from methanol. Finally, by combining with the chemical process from CO2 to methanol, a scaling-up bio-system was performed to convert CO2 into PHB, yielding 5.8 g/L with the productivity of 1.06 g-1L-1h-1. This approach represents a promising carbon-neutral way to produce biodegradable plastics.",

For attL and attR to be recombined by the integrase, the presence of its cognate recombination directionality factor (RDF) is required. It is hypothesized that the RDF binds the coiled-coil domain of the integrase to accomplish this switch in recombination directionality. Yet, nothing is known about the site of interaction between the RDF and integrase. Here, we tried to identify the region on the coiled-coil domain of PhiC31 integrase to which its cognate RDF (gp3) might bind.

In this study, the biosynthetic pathway of cucurbitacin IIa was elucidated by characterization of squalene epoxidases (HcSE1, HcSE2), cucurbitenol synthases (HcOSC6) and acyltransferases (HcAT1) in Hemsleya chinensis. Meanwhile, cycloartenol synthases (HcOSC1), isomultiflorenol synthases (HcOSC5) and {beta}-amyrin synthase (HcOSC2-4) involved in sterol and triterpenes biosynthesis were functionally illustrated. The high-level production of yeast the key cucurbitacin precursor, cucurbitadienol, was constructed to produce 296.37 mg/L cucurbitadienol and 722.99 mg/L total triterpenoid which is the highest yield cucurbitadienol from known engineered microbes. Moreover, production of cucurbitenol in transient expression of tobacco was employed to achieve 94.8 mg/g dry weight (dw) cucurbitenol from leaves. In this study, the key genes involved in cucurbitacin IIa biosynthesis were identified to facilitate its medical applications via biosynthetic strategy. Meanwhile, the high-level production of cucurbitadienol chassis yeast and tobacco transient expression offered a robust and sSupplemental Table substrate for pharmaceutical cucurbitacin production and screening platform for candidate genes involved in cucurbitacin biosynthesis.",

While CRISPR-derived tools have shown great success in editing disease-driving genes in human cells, we currently lack the tools to achieve comparable success for bacterial targets. Here we engineer a phage-derived particle to deliver a base editor and modify E. coli colonizing the mouse gut. This was achieved using a non-replicative DNA payload, preventing maintenance and dissemination of the payload, while allowing for an editing efficiency of up to 99.7% of the target bacterial population. The editing of a {beta}-lactamase gene resulted in the stable maintenance of edited bacteria in the mouse gut at least 42 days after treatment. By enabling the in situ modification of bacteria directly in the gut, our approach offers a novel avenue to investigate the function of bacterial genes and provides an opportunity to develop novel microbiome-targeted therapies.",

          "description": "As one of the newest fields of engineering, synthetic biology relies upon a trial-and-error Design-Build-Test-Learn approach to simultaneously learn how function is encoded in biology and attempt to engineer it. Many software and hardware platforms have been developed to automate, optimize, and algorithmically perform each step of the Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle. However, there are many fewer options for automating the Build step. Build typically involves DNA assembly, which remains manual, low throughput, and unreliable in most cases, limiting our ability to advance the science and engineering of biology. Here, we present AssemblyTron: an open-source python package to integrate j5 DNA assembly design software outputs with build implementation in Opentrons liquid handling robotics with minimal human intervention. We demonstrate the versatility of AssemblyTron through several scarless, multipart DNA assemblies beginning from fragment amplification. We show that AssemblyTron can perform PCRs across a range of fragment lengths and annealing temperatures by using an optimal annealing temperature gradient calculation algorithm. We then demonstrate that AssemblyTron can perform Golden Gate and homology-dependent in vivo assemblies with comparable fidelity to manual assemblies by simultaneously building four four-fragment assemblies of chromoprotein reporter expression plasmids. Finally, we used AssemblyTron to perform site-directed mutagenesis reactions via homology-dependent in vivo assembly also achieving comparable fidelity to manual assemblies as assessed by sequencing. AssemblyTron can reduce the time, training, costs, and wastes associated with synthetic biology, which along with open-source and affordable automation, will further foster the accessibility of synthetic biology and accelerate biological research and engineering.",

This resource broadly enables cell-type independent interrogation and discovery of proteins from intracellular pathogens capable of binding phosphorylated human proteins.

On the other hand, it is the only carbon source that is scalable enough to establish a circular carbon economy. Accordingly, technologies to capture and convert CO2 to reduced one-carbon (C1) molecules (e.g. formate) using renewable energy are improving fast. Driven by the idea of creating sustainable bioproduction platforms, natural and synthetic C1-utilization pathways are engineered into industrially relevant microbes. The realization of synthetic C1-assimilation cycles in living organisms is a promising but challenging endeavour. Here, we engineer the autocatalytic serine threonine cycle, a synthetic C1-assimilation route in Escherichia coli. Our stepwise engineering approach in tailored selection strains combined with adaptive laboratory evolution experiments enabled the organism to grow on formate. The synthetic strain uses formate as the sole carbon and energy source and is capable of growing at ambient CO2 concentrations, demonstrating the feasibility of establishing synthetic C1-assimilation cycles over laboratory timescales.",

Strategy updates are governed by a Boltzmann distribution, which depends on the neighborhood bank values associated with each strategy, relative to a temperature scale, which defines the random fluctuations. Players with higher bank values are, thus, less likely to change strategy than players with a lower bank value. For a parameterized rock–paper–scissors game, we derive a condition under which communities of a given strategy form with either fixed or drifting boundaries. We show the effect of a temperature increase on the underlying system and identify surprising properties of this model through numerical simulations.",

To analyze the spread of infectious diseases among different areas, e.g., communities, cities, or countries, we construct a network, based on the epidemic model and the network coupling, whose nodes denote areas, and edges represent population migrations between two areas. Each node follows its dynamic, which describes an epidemic spreading among individuals in an area, and the node also interacts with other nodes, which indicates the spreading among different areas. By giving mathematical proof, we deduce that our model has a stable solution despite the network structure. We propose the peak infected ratio (PIR) as a property of infectious diseases in a certain area, which is not independent of the network structure. We find that increasing the population mobility or the disease infectiousness both cause higher peak infected population all over different by simulation. Furthermore, we apply our model to real-world data on COVID-19 and after properly adjusting the parameters of our model, the distribution of the peak infection ratio in different areas can be well fitted.",

This feature can provide a new indicator for scar formation. In addition, it is found that the Fisher information of the Landau–Zener interaction is significantly larger than that of the Demkov interaction.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we consider a three-tiered food web model in a chemostat, including chlorophenol, phenol, and hydrogen substrates and their degraders. The model takes into account the three substrate inflowing concentrations, as well as maintenance, that is, decay terms of the species. The operating diagrams give the asymptotic behavior of the model with respect to the four operating parameters, which are the dilution rate and the three inflowing concentrations of the substrates. These diagrams were obtained only numerically in the existing literature. Using the mathematical analysis of this model obtained in our previous studies, we construct the operating diagrams, by plotting the curves that separate their various regions. Hence, the regions of the operating diagrams are constructed analytically and there is no requirement for time-consuming algorithms to generate the plots, as in the numerical method.

However, our method applies for a large class of growth functions. We construct operating diagrams with and without maintenance showing the role of maintenance on the stability of the system.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe present a unifying, tractable approach for studying the spread of viruses causing complex diseases requiring to be modeled using a large number of types (e.g., infective stage, clinical state, risk factor class). We show that recording each infected individual’s infection age, i.e., the time elapsed since infection, has three benefits. First, regardless of the number of types, the age distribution of the population can be described by means of a first-order, one-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE) known as the McKendrick-von Foerster equation. The frequency of type i is simply obtained by integrating the probability of being in state i at a given age against the age distribution. This representation induces a simple methodology based on the additional assumption of Poisson sampling to infer and forecast the epidemic. We illustrate this technique using French data from the COVID-19 epidemic. Second, our approach generalizes and simplifies standard compartmental models using high-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to account for disease complexity. We show that such models can always be rewritten in our framework, thus, providing a low-dimensional yet equivalent representation of these complex models. Third, beyond the simplicity of the approach, we show that our population model naturally appears as a universal scaling limit of a large class of fully stochastic individual-based epidemic models, where the initial condition of the PDE emerges as the limiting age structure of an exponentially growing population starting from a single individual.",

It is a well-recognised challenge to understand the effects of noise on the stability of such networks. We demonstrate that the patterns of activity generated by networks of grid cells emerge from the instability of homogeneous activity for small levels of noise. This is carried out by analysing the robustness of network activity patterns with respect to noise in an upscaled noisy grid cell model in the form of a system of partial differential equations. Inhomogeneous network patterns are numerically understood as branches bifurcating from unstable homogeneous states for small noise levels. We show that there is a phase transition occurring as the level of noise decreases.

In addition to usual issues (data often incomplete and noisy), epidemics of the same nature may be observed in several places or over different periods. The resulting possible inter-epidemic variability is rarely explicitly considered. Here, we propose to tackle multiple epidemics through a unique model incorporating a stochastic representation for each epidemic and to jointly estimate its parameters from noisy and partial observations. By building on a previous work for prevalence data, a Gaussian state-space model is extended to a model with mixed effects on the parameters describing simultaneously several epidemics and their observation process. An appropriate inference method is developed, by coupling the SAEM algorithm with Kalman-type filtering. Moreover, we consider here incidence data, which requires to develop a new version of the filtering algorithm. Its performances are investigated on SIR simulated epidemics for prevalence and incidence data. Our method outperforms an inference method separately processing each dataset. An application to SEIR influenza outbreaks in France over several years using incidence data is also carried out. Parameter estimations highlight a non-negligible variability between influenza seasons, both in transmission and case reporting. The main contribution of our study is to rigorously and explicitly account for the inter-epidemic variability between multiple outbreaks, both from the viewpoint of modeling and inference with a parsimonious statistical model.",

These fronts are shown to be linear combinations of exponentially decaying solutions to the linear system near the unstable state.

In this paper, a two-trophic ecosystem comprising of two species of predators, competing for their common prey, with explicit interference competition is considered. With proper rescaling, the model is portrayed as a singularly perturbed system with fast prey dynamics and slow dynamics of the predators. In a parameter regime near singular Hopf bifurcation, chaotic mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs), featuring concatenation of small and large amplitude oscillations are observed as long-lasting transients before the system approaches its asymptotic state. To analyze the dynamical cause that initiates a large amplitude oscillation in an MMO orbit, the model is reduced to a suitable normal form near the singular-Hopf point. The normal form possesses a separatrix surface that separates two different types of oscillations. A large amplitude oscillation is initiated if a trajectory moves from the “inner” to the “outer side” of this surface. A set of conditions on the normal form variables are obtained to determine whether a trajectory would exhibit another cycle of MMO dynamics before experiencing a regime shift (i.e. approaching its asymptotic state). These conditions serve as early warning signs for a sudden population shift as well as detect the onset of a regime shift in this ecological model.",

          "description": "Abstract\nRandomized trials of infectious disease interventions, such as vaccines, often focus on groups of connected or potentially interacting individuals. When the pathogen of interest is transmissible between study subjects, interference may occur: individual infection outcomes may depend on treatments received by others. Epidemiologists have defined the primary parameter of interest—called the “susceptibility effect”—as a contrast in infection risk under treatment versus no treatment, while holding exposure to infectiousness constant. A related quantity—the “direct effect”—is defined as an unconditional contrast between the infection risk under treatment versus no treatment. The purpose of this paper is to show that under a widely recommended randomization design, the direct effect may fail to recover the sign of the true susceptibility effect of the intervention in a randomized trial when outcomes are contagious. The analytical approach uses structural features of infectious disease transmission to define the susceptibility effect. A new probabilistic coupling argument reveals stochastic dominance relations between potential infection outcomes under different treatment allocations. The results suggest that estimating the direct effect under randomization may provide misleading conclusions about the effect of an intervention—such as a vaccine—when outcomes are contagious. Investigators who estimate the direct effect may wrongly conclude an intervention that protects treated individuals from infection is harmful, or that a harmful treatment is beneficial.",

In practice, it is of substantial interest to estimate the model parameters based on noisy observations early in the outbreak, well before the epidemic reaches its peak. This allows prediction of the subsequent course of the epidemic and design of appropriate interventions. However, accurately inferring SIR model parameters in such scenarios is problematic. This article provides novel, theoretical insight on this issue of practical identifiability of the SIR model. Our theory provides new understanding of the inferential limits of routinely used epidemic models and provides a valuable addition to current simulate-and-check methods.

Plant–herbivore interactions are often described by using discrete-time models in the case of non-overlapping generations: such generations have some specific time interval of life and their old generations are replaced by new generations after some regular interval of time. Keeping in mind the dynamical reliability of continuous-time models we presented two discrete-time plant–herbivore models. Mainly, by applying Euler’s forward method a discrete-time plant–herbivore model is obtained from a continuous-time plant–herbivore model. In addition, a dynamically consistent discrete-time plant–herbivore model is obtained by applying a nonstandard difference scheme. Moreover, local stability is discussed and the existence of bifurcation about positive equilibrium is shown under some mathematical conditions. To control bifurcation and chaos, a modified hybrid technique is developed. Finally, to support our theocratical results and to show the dynamical reliability of the nonstandard difference scheme some numerical examples are provided.",

We highlight vertex results, which allow us to check whether a property is satisfied for all parameter choices in the hyper-rectangle by simply checking whether it is satisfied for all parameter choices at the vertices of the hyper-rectangle. We show that, for a vast class of systems, including (bio)chemical reaction networks with mass-action kinetics, the system Jacobian has a totally multiaffine structure (namely, all minors of the Jacobian matrix are multiaffine functions of the uncertain parameters), which can be exploited to obtain several vertex results. We consider different problems: robust non-singularity; robust stability of the steady-state; robust steady-state sensitivity analysis, in the case of constant perturbations; robust frequency-response sensitivity analysis, in the presence of periodic perturbations; and robust adaptation analysis. The developed theory is then applied to gain insight into some examples of uncertain biochemical systems, including the incoherent feed-forward loop, the coherent feed-forward loop, the Brusselator oscillator and the Goldbeter oscillator.",

Our procedure is based on an intuitive understanding of the physical properties of phenomena. The idea is that individuals have the tendency to be attracted (or repulsed) to certain properties of the environment. At the same time, they are spread in such a way that if there is no reason for them to be in some specific locations, then they are uniformly distributed throughout the region. Our model draws from quantum mechanics, by using quantum Hamiltonians in the context of classical statistical mechanics. The equilibrium between the spreading and the attractive (or repulsive) forces determines the behavior of the species that we model, and this is expressed in terms of a global control problem of an energy operator which is the sum of a kinetic term (spreading) and a potential (attraction or repulsion). We focus on the full probability measure and a global control of the model (instead of looking at conditional measures that generate a global measure). Furthermore, we propose a numerical solution to this global control problem that overcomes the well-known major difficulty of Gibbs sampling (annealing) which is the fact that a global control is hardly reachable when the number of variables is large (the algorithms get stuck in non-optimal states).",

The optimal strategies of each of these configurations are here analyzed explicitly also with the aid of some special functions of classical flavor and the results are confronted with the existing paradigms of the Lévy foraging hypothesis. Interestingly, one discovers bifurcation phenomena in which a sudden switch occurs between an optimal (but somehow unreliable) Lévy foraging pattern of inverse square law type and a less ideal (but somehow more secure) classical Brownian motion strategy.

Modifications can include categories such people who have been exposed to the disease but are not yet infectious or those who die from the disease. However, the model has nearly always been applied to the entire population of a country or state but there is considerable observational evidence that diseases can spread at different rates in densely populated urban regions and sparsely populated rural areas. This work presents a new approach that applies a SIR type model to a country or state that has been divided into a number of geographical regions, and uses different infection rates in each region which depend on the population density in that region. Further, the model contains a simple matrix based method for simulating the movement of people between different regions. The model is applied to the spread of disease in the United Kingdom and the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil.",

One way to study such events is in terms of the ploidy number of the species that make up a dataset of interest. It is therefore natural to ask: How much information about the evolutionary past of the set of species that form a dataset can be gleaned from the ploidy numbers of the species? To help answer this question, we introduce and study the novel concept of a ploidy profile which allows us to formalize it in terms of a multiplicity vector indexed by the species the dataset is comprised of. Using the framework of a phylogenetic network, we present a closed formula for computing the hybrid number (i.e. the minimal number of polyploidization events required to explain a ploidy profile) of a large class of ploidy profiles. This formula relies on the construction of a certain phylogenetic network from the simplification sequence of a ploidy profile and the hybrid number of the ploidy profile with which this construction is initialized. Both of them can be computed easily in case the ploidy numbers that make up the ploidy profile are not too large. To help illustrate the applicability of our approach, we apply it to a simplified version of a publicly available Viola dataset.",

The recent establishment of the invasive spotted lanternfly in the northeastern United States has proven devastating to farms and vineyards, necessitating urgent development of population dynamical models and effective control practices. In this paper, we propose a stage-age-structured system of PDEs to model insect pest populations, in which underlying dynamics are dictated by ambient temperature through rates of development, fecundity, and mortality. The model incorporates diapause and non-diapause pathways, and is calibrated to experimental and field data on the spotted lanternfly. We develop a novel moving mesh method for capturing age-advection accurately, even for coarse discretization parameters.

          "description": "Abstract\nWe propose a mathematical model, namely a reaction–diffusion system, to describe social behaviour of cockroaches. An essential new aspect in our model is that the dispersion behaviour due to overcrowding effect is taken into account as a counterpart to commonly studied aggregation. This consideration leads to an intriguing new phenomenon which has not been observed in the literature. Namely, due to the competition between aggregation towards areas of higher concentration of pheromone and dispersion avoiding overcrowded areas, the cockroaches aggregate more at the transition area of pheromone. Moreover, we also consider the fast reaction limit where the switching rate between active and inactive subpopulations tends to infinity. By utilising improved duality and energy methods, together with the regularisation of heat operator, we prove that the weak solution of the reaction–diffusion system converges to that of a reaction-cross-diffusion system.",

          "description": "Abstract\nWe consider interactions between players in groups of size \n                      \n                      \\(d\\ge 2\\)\n                      \n                     with payoffs that not only depend on the strategies used in the group but also fluctuate at random over time. An individual can adopt either cooperation or defection as strategy and the population is updated from one time step to the next by a birth-death event according to a Moran model. Assuming recurrent symmetric mutation and payoffs to cooperators and defectors according to the composition of the group whose expected values, variances, and covariances are of the same small order, we derive a first-order approximation for the average abundance of cooperation in the selection-mutation equilibrium. In general, we show that increasing the variance of any payoff for defection or decreasing the variance of any payoff for cooperation increases the average abundance of cooperation. As for the effect of the covariance between any payoff for cooperation and any payoff for defection, we show that it depends on the number of cooperators in the group associated with these payoffs. We study in particular the public goods game, the stag hunt game, and the snowdrift game, all social dilemmas based on random benefit b and random cost c for cooperation, which lead to correlated payoffs to cooperators and defectors within groups. We show that a decrease in the scaled variance of b or c, or an increase in their scaled covariance, makes it easier for weak selection to favor the abundance of cooperation in the stag hunt game and the snowdrift game. The same conclusion holds for the public goods game except that the variance of b has no effect on the average abundance of C. Moreover, while the mutation rate has little effect on which strategy is more abundant at equilibrium, the group size may change it at least in the stag hunt game with a larger group size making it more difficult for cooperation to be more abundant than defection under weak selection.",

          "description": "Abstract\nAutocatalysis underlies the ability of chemical and biochemical systems to replicate. Recently, Blokhuis et al. (PNAS 117(41):25230–25236, 2020) gave a stoechiometric definition of autocatalysis for reaction networks, stating the existence of a combination of reactions such that the balance for all autocatalytic species is strictly positive, and investigated minimal autocatalytic networks, called autocatalytic cores. By contrast, spontaneous autocatalysis—namely, exponential amplification of all species internal to a reaction network, starting from a diluted regime, i.e. low concentrations—is a dynamical property. We introduce here a topological condition (Top) for autocatalysis, namely: restricting the reaction network description to highly diluted species, we assume existence of a strongly connected component possessing at least one reaction with multiple products (including multiple copies of a single species). We find this condition to be necessary and sufficient for stoechiometric autocatalysis. When degradation reactions have small enough rates, the topological condition further ensures dynamical autocatalysis, characterized by a strictly positive Lyapunov exponent giving the instantaneous exponential growth rate of the system. The proof is generally based on the study of auxiliary Markov chains. We provide as examples general autocatalytic cores of Type I and Type III in the typology of Blokhuis et al. (PNAS 117(41):25230–25236, 2020) . In a companion article (Unterberger in Dynamical autocatalysis for autocatalytic cores, 2021), Lyapunov exponents and the behavior in the growth regime are studied quantitatively beyond the present diluted regime .",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we apply the immersed interface method (IIM) and the hierarchical derivative matching (HDM) method, respectively, to restore the accuracy of the high-order alternating direction implicit finite-difference time-domain (ADI-FDTD) scheme of the 2D Maxwell’s equations with material interfaces. For the case of discontinuous permittivity \n                      \n                      \\(\\varepsilon \\)\n                      \n                     and continuous permeability \n                      \n                      \\(\\mu \\)\n                      \n                    , we propose four high-order schemes. Two of them are of second order in time and fourth order in space (ADI-IIM-FDTD(2,4) scheme and ADI-HDM-FDTD(2,4) scheme). Others are of fourth order both in time and space (ADI-IIM-FDTD(4,4) scheme and ADI-HDM-FDTD(4,4) scheme). For the case of discontinuous permittivity \n                      \n                      \\(\\varepsilon \\)\n                      \n                     and permeability \n                      \n                      \\(\\mu \\)\n                      \n                    , the (2,4) scheme and the (4,4) scheme are constructed as well (ADI-HDM-FDTD-X(2,4) scheme and ADI-HDM-FDTD-X(4,4) scheme). The proposed six schemes maintain the advantages of ADI-FDTD method such as unconditional stability and computational efficiency. Numerical examples are given to verify the performance of the proposed schemes.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper we consider a partially augmented fully-mixed variational formulation that has been recently proposed for the coupling of the stationary Brinkman–Forchheimer and double-diffusion equations, and develop an a posteriori error analysis for the 2D and 3D versions of the associated mixed finite element scheme. Indeed, we derive two reliable and efficient residual-based a posteriori error estimators for this problem on arbitrary (convex or non-convex) polygonal and polyhedral regions. The reliability of the proposed estimators draws mainly upon the uniform ellipticity and inf-sup condition of the forms involved, a suitable assumption on the data, stable Helmholtz decompositions in Hilbert and Banach frameworks, and the local approximation properties of the Clément and Raviart–Thomas operators. In turn, inverse inequalities, the localization technique based on bubble functions, and known results from previous works, are the main tools yielding the efficiency estimate. Finally, several numerical examples confirming the theoretical properties of the estimators and illustrating the performance of the associated adaptive algorithms, are reported. In particular, the case of flow through a 3D porous media with channel networks is considered.",

Due to its advantage of capturing the correlations between any modes of the multi-dimensional image, i.e., the target tensor, the fully-connected tensor network (FCTN) decomposition has recently shown promising performance on multi-dimensional image recovery. However, FCTN decomposition suffers from computational deficiency, especially for large-scale multi-dimensional images. To address this deficiency, we propose a learnable transform-based FCTN model (termed as T-FCTN), which enjoys the remarkable advantage of FCTN decomposition with cheap computational cost.

          "description": "Abstract\nThe purpose of this work is to describe in detail the development of the spectral difference Raviart–Thomas (SDRT) formulation for two and three-dimensional tensor-product elements and simplexes. Through the process, the authors establish the equivalence between the SDRT method and the flux reconstruction (FR) approach under the assumption of the linearity of the flux and the mesh uniformity. Such a connection allows building a new family of FR schemes for two and three-dimensional simplexes and also to recover the well-known FR-SD method with tensor-product elements. In addition, a thorough analysis of the numerical dissipation and dispersion of both aforementioned schemes and the nodal discontinuous Galerkin FR (FR-DG) method with two and three-dimensional elements is proposed through the use of the combined-mode Fourier approach. SDRT is shown to possess an enhanced temporal linear stability in comparison to FR-DG. On the contrary, SDRT displays larger dissipation and dispersion errors with respect to FR-DG. Finally, the study is concluded with a set of numerical experiments, the linear advection-diffusion problem, the Isentropic Euler Vortex, and the Taylor-Green Vortex (TGV). The latter test case shows that SDRT schemes present a non-linear unstable behavior with simplex elements and certain polynomial degrees. For the sake of completeness, the matrix form of the SDRT method is developed and the computational performance of SDRT with respect to FR schemes is evaluated using GPU architectures.",

However, singular value decomposition (SVD), which is computationally expensive for large-scale matrices, frequently appears in solving those nuclear norm minimization models. Based on the tensor-tensor product (T-product), in this paper, we first establish the equivalence between the so-called transformed tubal nuclear norm for a third-order tensor and the minimum of the sum of two factor tensors’ squared Frobenius norms under a general invertible linear transform. Gainfully, we introduce a mode-unfolding (often named as “spatio-temporal” in the internet traffic data recovery literature) regularized tensor completion model that is able to efficiently exploit the hidden structures of tensors. Then, we propose an implementable alternating minimization algorithm to solve the underlying optimization model. It is remarkable that our approach does not require any SVDs and all subproblems of our algorithm enjoy closed-form solutions. A series of numerical experiments on traffic data recovery, color images and videos inpainting demonstrate that our SVD-free approach takes less computing time to achieve satisfactory accuracy than some state-of-the-art tensor nuclear norm minimization approaches.",

Nevertheless, those methods are all constructed based on knowing the exact values of the derivatives of the source term. Therefore, this drawback mostly prevents their actual applications as the analytic form of the source term is rarely available. In this paper, we propose a sixth-order quasi-compact difference method, without having to know the derivatives of the source term, for solving the 2D and 3D Poisson equations. Our strategy is to discretize the equation by the fourth-order compact scheme at the improper interior grid points that adjoin the boundary, while the sixth-order scheme, where it is compact only for the unknowns, is exploited to the proper interior grid points that are not adjoining the boundary. Theoretically, we rigorously prove that the proposed method can achieve the global sixth-order accuracy. Since there are no derivatives of the source term involved in the proposed scheme, our global sixth-order quasi-compact difference method can be developed to solve the time-dependent problems using a time advancing scheme. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the convergence order and the efficiency of the proposed methods.",

          "description": "Abstract\nAdaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and wavelet-based multi-resolution technique, which refine the spatial resolution in regions of interest and coarsen the mesh in other regions, are widely used in scientific computing for higher computational efficiency. The key component of AMR and the multi-resolution method is the adaptation strategy including the regularity estimation. In this paper, a new adaptation strategy for AMR and the multi-resolution method is proposed. Different from AMR, which measures the function regularity based on an empirical gradient operator, and the multi-resolution method with complicated wavelet analysis, the new approach examines the solution smoothness based on the high-order TENO reconstruction (Fu et al. in J Comput Phys 305:333–359, 2016). The core idea is that the TENO scheme not only provides the reconstructed data at the cell interface for flux evaluation but also classifies the local flow scales as smooth or nonsmooth on the discretized mesh. Since the scale-separation procedure is achieved in the spectral and characteristic space, the new adaptation strategy is weakly problem-dependent. Moreover, the extra complexity due to the empirical gradient computing or the wavelet analysis is eliminated. Based on Harten’s finite-volume multi-resolution method (Harten in J Comput Phys 115(2):319–338, 1994), a set of benchmark cases is simulated to validate the performance of the proposed method.",

Our formulation is based in the fact that the flux of MPFA methods can be split into two different parts: a Two Point Flux Approximation (TPFA) component and the Cross-Diffusion Terms (CDT). In the linear MPFA-D method, this split is particularly simple since it lies at the core of the original method construction. In this context, we introduce a non-linear defect correction, aiming to mitigate, whenever necessary, the contributions from the CDT, avoiding, this way, spurious oscillations and DMP violations. Our new MPFA-DNL scheme is locally conservative and capable of dealing with arbitrary anisotropic diffusion tensors and unstructured meshes, without harming the second order convergence rates of the original MPFA-D. To appraise the accuracy and robustness of our formulation, we solve some benchmark problems found in literature. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to tetrahedral meshes, even though, in principle, there is no restriction to extend the method to other polyhedral control volumes.",

The key feature of our scheme is that it gives an approximation directly just by taking a weighted average of the available discrete function values evaluated at sampling centers in the periodic domain. As such, it is simple, easy to compute, and the implementation process is stable. Moreover, if the sampling centers distribute uniformly over the periodic domain, it even preserves the same convergence order to all the derivatives. To employ the iterated quasi-interpolation scheme for solving time-dependent surface PDEs, we follow the framework of the method-of-lines. More precisely, we first reformulate the PDEs in terms of the parametric form of the surface. Then we use our quasi-interpolation scheme to approximate both the analytic solution and its spatial derivatives in the reformulated form (of PDEs) to get a semi-discrete ordinary differential equation (ODE) system. Finally, we adopt an appropriate time-integration technique to obtain the full-discrete scheme. As concrete examples, we take the torus for illustration and solve some benchmark reaction-diffusion equations imposed on the torus at the end of the paper. However, the proposed method is general and works on time-dependent PDEs defined on any smooth closed parameterized surfaces without coordinate singularity.",

Adaptive Galerkin methods for time-dependent partial differential equations are studied and shown to be dissipative. The adaptation implies that the subset of the selected basis function changes over time according to the evolution of the solution. The corresponding projection operator is thus time-dependent and nondifferentiable. We therefore propose to use an integral formulation in time. We analyze the existence and uniqueness of this weak form of the dynamical Galerkin scheme, and we then prove that the nonsmooth projection operator introduces energy dissipation, which is a crucial result for adaptive Galerkin methods, e.g., adaptive wavelet methods. Numerical examples for the inviscid Burgers equation in one dimension and the incompressible Euler equations in two and three spatial dimensions show that the selection of basis functions, for instance by filtering out weak wavelet coefficients from the solution, introduces energy dissipation. Moreover, for the Burgers case we can show that adaptive wavelet regularization yields convergence of the truncated Galerkin solution to the physically relevant entropy solution. These results motivate adaptive wavelet-based Galerkin schemes for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws.",

Our framework is applied to a semilinear elliptic equation with oscillatory media and a nonlinear radiative transfer equation; in both cases, significant improvements in efficacy are observed.

In this paper, an online multiscale model reduction method is presented for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with multiplicative noise, where the diffusion coefficient is spatially multiscale and the noise perturbation nonlinearly depends on the diffusion dynamics. It is necessary to efficiently compute all possible trajectories of the stochastic dynamics for quantifying a model’s uncertainty and statistic moments. The multiscale diffusion and nonlinearity may cause the computation to become very intractable. To overcome the multiscale difficulty, a constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) is used to localize the computation and obtain an effective coarse model. However, the nonlinear terms are still defined on a fine scale space after the Galerkin projection of CEM-GMsFEM is applied to the nonlinear SPDEs. This significantly impacts the simulation efficiency by CEM-GMsFEM. To this end, a stochastic online discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) is proposed to treat the stochastic nonlinearity. The stochastic online DEIM incorporates offline snapshots and online snapshots. The offline snapshots consist of the nonlinear terms at the approximate mean of the stochastic dynamics and are used to construct an offline reduced model. The online snapshots contain some information of the current new trajectory and are used to correct the offline reduced model in an incremental manner. The stochastic online DEIM substantially reduces the dimension of the nonlinear dynamics and enhances the prediction accuracy for the reduced model. Thus, the online multiscale model reduction is constructed by using CEM-GMsFEM and the stochastic online DEIM. A priori error analysis is carried out for the nonlinear SPDEs. We present a few numerical examples with diffusion in heterogeneous porous media and show the effectiveness of the proposed model reduction.",

It describes the motion of a suspension of rigid rod-like particles under the influence of gravity. Since the coupled system is high dimensional (five dimensions plus time) we are interested in the derivation of models which can adaptively adjust the level of detail.

We establish improved uniform error bounds on time-splitting methods for the long-time dynamics of the Dirac equation with small electromagnetic potentials characterized by a dimensionless parameter [math] representing the amplitude of the potentials. We begin with a semidiscretization of the Dirac equation in time by a time-splitting method, followed by a full-discretization in space by with the Fourier pseudospectral method in space. By employing the unitary flow property of the second-order time-splitting method for the Dirac equation, we prove uniform error bounds for [math] at [math] and [math] for the semidiscretization and full-discretization, respectively, for any time [math] with [math] and [math]. In the expressions, [math] is the time step, [math] is the mesh size, [math] depends on the regularity of the solution, and [math] grows at most linearly with respect to [math] with [math] and [math] two constants independent of [math], [math], [math], and [math]. Then by adopting the regularity compensation oscillation technique, which controls the high frequency modes by the regularity of the solution and low frequency modes by phase cancellation and energy method, we establish improved uniform error bounds at [math] and [math] for the semidiscretization and full-discretization, respectively, up to the long-time [math].

A systematic two-step procedure is proposed for the derivation of full asymptotic expansions of the solution of elliptic partial differential equations set on a domain perforated with a small hole on which a Dirichlet boundary condition is applied. First, an integral representation of the solution is sought, which enables us to exploit the explicit dependence with respect to the small parameter to predict the correct form of a two-scale ansatz. Second, the terms of the ansatz are characterized by the method of compound asymptotic expansions as the solutions of a cascade of successive interior and exterior domains. This allows us to interpret them as high-order correctors, for which error bounds can be proved using variational estimates. The methodology is illustrated on two different problems: we start by revisiting the perforated Poisson problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions on both the hole and the outer boundary, where we highlight how the method enables us to retrieve very naturally the correct form of the ansatz in the most delicate two-dimensional setting. Then, we provide original and complete asymptotic expansions for a perforated cell problem featuring periodic conditions.",
