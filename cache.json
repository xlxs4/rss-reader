          "description": "Abstract\nWe propose a reduced-order model (ROM) based on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) for efficient reduced-order modeling of parameterized time-dependent partial differential equations. Given high-fidelity solutions for training time and parameter sets, a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is first used to extract the POD modes and the projection coefficients onto the modes. After that, a DMD model is built for each parameter value based on the corresponding projection coefficients. These DMD models are used to predict the projection coefficients over a larger time region than the training time region. We rearrange these predicted coefficients as a new matrix and perform POD again to decompose the matrix into time-dependent and parameter-dependent parts, which are approximated using cubic spline interpolation (CSI) and Gaussian process regression (GPR), respectively. Finally, the ROM solutions at any given time or parameter value are estimated by a simple multiplication of the POD modes and the approximated projection coefficients. The proposed method is tested through several benchmark problems, and the impact of using CSI and GPR to model the time-dependent part on the model accuracy is analyzed. In addition, numerical results for a PDE with 19 parameters demonstrate the great potential of the proposed method in the construction of a ROM for problems with high dimensional parameters.",

The methods have been widely used in various numerical simulations in the last several decades, while the existing analysis is not optimal due to the strong coupling of system and the pollution of the lower-order Nédélec’s edge approximation in analysis. In terms of a newly modified Maxwell projection we establish new and optimal error estimates. In particular, we prove that the method based on the commonly-used Taylor-Hood/lowest-order Nédélec’s edge element is efficient and the method provides the second-order accuracy for numerical velocity.

After semi-discretizating the equations, a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations with a Toeplitz structure is induced.

Long time energy conservation is analysed for symplectic algorithms and the proposed algorithms are shown to have uniform error bound in the position for the highly oscillatory structure.

Then we propose a domain decomposition method for efficiently solving such a large complex system. Robin boundary conditions are used to decouple the Dual-Porosity equations from the Navier–Stokes equations in the coupled system. Based on the two decoupled sub-problems, a parallel Robin-Robin domain decomposition method is constructed and then discretized by finite elements. We analyze the convergence of the domain decomposition method with the finite element discretization and investigate the effect of Robin parameters on the convergence, which also provide instructions for how to choose the Robin parameters in practice. Three cases of Robin parameters are studied, including a difficult case which was not fully addressed in the literature, and the optimal geometric convergence rate is obtained. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the theoretical conclusions, illustrate how the theory can provide instructions on choosing Robin parameters, and show the features of the proposed model and domain decomposition method.",

Barnett has provided new bounds on the rate of ill-conditioning (Barnett in SIAM Rev 64:105–131, 2022). In this paper we focus on the corresponding singular value decomposition. The singular vectors can be computed from the so-called periodic discrete prolate spheroidal sequences, named in analogy to spheroidal wave functions which are associated with the continuous Fourier transform. Their numerical computation is hampered by the clustering of singular values. We collect and expand known results on the stable numerical computation of the singular value decomposition of Fourier submatrices. The prolate sequences are eigenvectors of a tridiagonal matrix whose spectrum is free of clusters and this enables their computation. We collect these observations in a simple and convenient algorithm. The corresponding singular values can be accurately computed as well, except when they are small. Even then, small singular values can be computed in high-precision arithmetic with modest computational effort, even for large and extremely ill-conditioned submatrices. We illustrate the computations and point out a few applications in which Fourier submatrices arise.",

          "description": "Abstract\nGaussian processes (GPs) are used for numerous different applications, including uncertainty quantification and optimization. Ill-conditioning of the covariance matrix for GPs is common with the use of various kernels, including the Gaussian, rational quadratic, and Matérn kernels. A common approach to overcome this problem is to add a nugget along the diagonal of the covariance matrix. For GPs that are not constructed with gradients, it is straightforward to derive a nugget value that guarantees the condition number of the covariance matrix to be below a user-set threshold. However, for gradient-enhanced GPs, there are no existing practical bounds to select a nugget that guarantee that the condition number of the gradient-enhanced covariance matrix is below a user-set threshold. In this paper a novel approach is taken to bound the condition number of the covariance matrix for GPs that use the Gaussian kernel. This is achieved by using non-isotropic rescaling for the data and a modest nugget value. This non-intrusive method works for GPs applied to problems of any dimension and it allows all data points to be kept. The method is applied to a Bayesian optimizer using a gradient-enhanced GP to achieve deep convergence. Without this method, the high condition number constrains the hyperparameters for the GP and this is shown to impede the convergence of the optimizer. It is also demonstrated that applying this method to the rational quadratic and Matérn kernels alleviates the ill-conditioning of their gradient-enhanced covariance matrices. Implementation of the method is straightforward and clearly described in the paper.",

The long time behavior of a kind of fully magnetic effected piezoelectric system is considered. The impact of the presence of only one friction-type infinite memory term on the stability of the piezoelectric coupled plate is investigated. By introducing the so called “minimal state variable” and using semigroup theories, the system is proved to be well-posed. It is found that this kind of memory term still acts as a damping to some extent under certain conditions, but its damping effect is too weak to indirectly stabilize the system exponentially. Based on frequency domain analysis, it is further proved that this system can be indirectly stabilized polynomially by only one friction-type infinite memory term located on one of these strongly coupled PDEs. Especially, the optimality of this decay rate is also further verified by detailed spectral analysis for the system operator.",

Consequently, we obtain the global well-posedness for the nonlinear Schrödinger equations with common noise on a graph.

Modeling diffusive processes via a constant effective diffusivity value taken to represent realistic uncertainty or heterogeneity is entrenched in scientific and engineering applications. This brings forth the question, to what extent does the flow pattern changes when symmetry is broken by anisotropy. This study supplies the answer by deriving a class of tridimensional solutions to the steady nonlinear diffusion equation in a spherical domain divided into an arbitrary number of meridian sectors with distinct diffusivities and generation rates. The new family of solutions permits flexible modeling, where traditionally only isotropic radial transport was considered. The flow patterns support an extensive variety of topological terrain via tesseral and sectoral harmonics. The anisotropy gives rise to an unconventional type of a fixed point combining both node and saddle attributes. The contours are nonsmooth on the contiguity planes between sectors and might or might not be localized in the polar angle [math] and/or azimuthal angle [math], implying a particle might remain confined to a relatively small neighborhood or meander over the sphere. The impact on motion trajectories and thus transport efficiency implies that the energy required to sustain a steady flow is starkly underestimated when symmetry is assumed for simplicity despite the presence of anisotropy.",

Mean-field equations have been developed recently to approximate the dynamics of the Deffuant model of opinion formation. These equations can describe both fully mixed populations and the case where individuals interact only along edges of a network. In each case, interactions only occur between individuals whose opinions differ by less than a given parameter, called the confidence bound. The size of the confidence bound parameter is known to strongly affect both the dynamics and the number and location of opinion clusters. In this work, we carry out a mathematical analysis of the mean-field equations to investigate the role of the confidence bound and boundaries on these important observables of the model. We consider the limit in which the confidence bound interval is small, and we identify the key mechanisms driving opinion evolution. We show that linear stability analysis can predict the number and location of opinion clusters. Comparison with numerical simulations of the model illustrates that the early-time dynamics and the final cluster locations can be accurately approximated for networks composed of two degree classes, as well as for the case of a fully mixed population.",

This paper investigates the inverse source problem with a single propagating mode at multiple frequencies in an acoustic waveguide. The goal is to provide both theoretical justification and efficient algorithms for imaging extended sources using the sampling methods. In contrast to the existing far/near-field operator based on the integral over the space variable in the sampling methods, a multi-frequency far-field operator is introduced based on the integral over the frequency variable. This far-field operator is defined in a way to incorporate the possibly nonlinear dispersion relation, a unique feature in waveguides. The factorization method is deployed to establish a rigorous characterization of the range support, which is the support of source in the direction of wave propagation. A related factorization-based sampling method is also discussed. These sampling methods are shown to be capable of imaging the range support of the source. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the sampling methods, including an example to image a complete sound-soft block.",

Online learning algorithms, widely used to power search and content optimization on the web, must balance exploration and exploitation, potentially sacrificing the experience of current users in order to gain information that will lead to better decisions in the future. While necessary in the worst case, explicit exploration has a number of disadvantages compared to the greedy algorithm that always “exploits” by choosing an action that currently looks optimal. We determine under what conditions inherent diversity in the data makes explicit exploration unnecessary. We build on a recent line of work on the smoothed analysis of the greedy algorithm in the linear contextual bandits model. We improve on prior results to show that the greedy algorithm almost matches the best possible Bayesian regret rate of any other algorithm on the same problem instance whenever the diversity conditions hold. The key technical finding is that data collected by the greedy algorithm suffices to simulate a run of any other algorithm. Further, we prove that under a particular smoothness assumption, the Bayesian regret of the greedy algorithm is at most [math] in the worst case, where [math] is the time horizon.",

Isomanifolds are the generalization of isosurfaces to arbitrary dimension and codimension, i.e., submanifolds of [math] defined as the zero set of some multivariate multivalued smooth function [math], where [math] is the intrinsic dimension of the manifold. A natural way to approximate a smooth isomanifold [math] is to consider its piecewise linear (PL) approximation [math] based on a triangulation [math] of the ambient space [math]. In this paper, we describe a simple algorithm to trace isomanifolds from a given starting point. The algorithm works for arbitrary dimensions [math] and [math], and any precision [math]. Our main result is that, when [math] (or [math]) has bounded complexity, the complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in [math] and [math] (and unavoidably exponential in [math]). Since it is known that for [math], [math] is [math]-close and isotopic to [math], our algorithm produces a faithful PL-approximation of isomanifolds of bounded complexity in time polynomial in [math]. Combining this algorithm with dimensionality reduction techniques, the dependency on [math] in the size of [math] can be completely removed with high probability. We also show that the algorithm can handle isomanifolds with boundary and, more generally, isostratifolds. The algorithm for isomanifolds with boundary has been implemented and experimental results are reported, showing that it is practical and can handle cases that are far ahead of the state-of-the-art.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. We consider the connectivity augmentation problem (CAP), a classical problem in the area of survivable network design. It is about increasing the edge-connectivity of a graph by one unit in the cheapest possible way. More precisely, given a [math]-edge-connected graph [math] and a set of extra edges, the task is to find a minimum cardinality subset of extra edges whose addition to [math] makes the graph [math]-edge-connected. If [math] is odd, the problem is known to reduce to the tree augmentation problem (TAP)—i.e., [math] is a spanning tree—for which significant progress has been achieved recently, leading to approximation factors below 1.5 (the current best factor is 1.458). However, advances on TAP have not carried over to CAP so …",
