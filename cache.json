          "description": "Abstract\nWe present a class of arbitrarily high-order conservative schemes for the Klein–Gordon Schrödinger equations. These schemes combine the symplectic Runge–Kutta method with the quadratic auxiliary variable approach. We first introduce an auxiliary variable that satisfies a quadratic equation to reformulate the original system into an equivalent one. This reformulated system possesses two strong quadratic invariants: energy and mass. Next, we discretize the reformulated system using symplectic Runge–Kutta methods, yielding a class of semi-discrete systems with arbitrarily high-order accuracy in time. The semi-discrete systems naturally preserve the discrete contour part of the strong invariants and the relationship of the quadratic equation. By eliminating the intermediate variable, we obtain the original energy conservation law. Then, the Fourier pseudo-spectral method is employed to obtain the fully discrete scheme that preserves the original energy and mass. We provide a fast solver to implement the proposed methods effectively. Numerical experiments demonstrate the expected accuracy and conservation of proposed schemes.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe shear shallow water model is an extension of the classical shallow water model to include the effects of vertical shear. It is a system of six non-linear hyperbolic PDE with non-conservative products. We develop a high-order entropy stable finite difference scheme for this model in one dimension and extend it to two dimensions on rectangular grids. The key idea is to rewrite the system so that non-conservative terms do not contribute to the entropy evolution. Then, we first develop an entropy conservative scheme for the conservative part, which is then extended to the complete system using the fact that the non-conservative terms do not contribute to the entropy production. The entropy dissipative scheme, which leads to an entropy inequality, is then obtained by carefully adding dissipative flux terms. The proposed schemes are then tested on several one and two-dimensional problems to demonstrate their stability and accuracy.",

A velocity shift proportional to the pressure gradient is introduced in the convective fluxes, which leads to the dissipation of mechanical energy and the entropy stability at all Mach numbers. The resolution of the semi-implicit in time and upwind finite volume in space fully-discrete scheme involves two steps: the solution of an elliptic problem for the density and an explicit evaluation for the velocity. The proposed scheme possesses several physically relevant attributes, such as the positivity of density, the entropy stability and the consistency with the weak formulation of the continuous Euler system. The AP property of the scheme, i.e. the boundedness of the mesh parameters with respect to the Mach number and its consistency with the incompressible limit system, is shown rigorously. The results of extensive case studies are presented to substantiate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method.",

The solution of a FPE is a probability density function (PDF). Traditional mesh-based methods are ineffective because of a unbounded computation domain, a large number of dimensions and a nonlocal fractional operator. To this end, we represent the solution with an explicit PDF model induced by a flow-based deep generative model, which constructs a transport map from a simple distribution to the target distribution. We consider two methods to approximate the fractional Laplacian. One method is the Monte Carlo approximation. The other method is to construct an auxiliary model with Gaussian radial basis functions (GRBFs) to approximate the solution such that we may take advantage of the fact that the fractional Laplacian of a Gaussian is known analytically. Based on these two different ways for the approximation of the fractional Laplacian, we propose two models to approximate stationary FPEs and one model to approximate time-dependent FPEs. To further improve the accuracy, we refine the training set and the approximate solution alternately. A variety of numerical examples is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptive deep density approaches.",

Transport coefficients, such as the mobility, thermal conductivity, and shear viscosity, are quantities of prime interest in statistical physics. At the macroscopic level, transport coefficients relate an external forcing of magnitude [math], with [math], acting on the system to an average response expressed through some steady-state flux. In practice, steady-state averages involved in the linear response are computed as time averages over a realization of some stochastic differential equation. Variance reduction techniques are of paramount interest in this context, as the linear response is scaled by a factor of [math], leading to large statistical error. One way to limit the increase in the variance is to allow for larger values of [math] by increasing the range of values of the forcing for which the nonlinear part of the response is sufficiently small. In theory, one can add an extra forcing to the physical perturbation of the system, called synthetic forcing, as long as this extra forcing preserves the invariant measure of the reference system. The aim is to find synthetic perturbations allowing one to reduce the nonlinear part of the response as much as possible. We present a mathematical framework for quantifying the quality of synthetic forcings, in the context of linear response theory, and discuss various possible choices for them. Our findings are illustrated with numerical results in low-dimensional systems.",

We present a fast direct solver for boundary integral equations on complex surfaces in three dimensions using an extension of the recently introduced recursive strong skeletonization scheme. For problems that are not highly oscillatory, our algorithm computes an [math]-like hierarchical factorization of the dense system matrix, permitting application of the inverse in [math] time, where [math] is the number of unknowns on the surface. The factorization itself also scales linearly with the system size, albeit with a somewhat larger constant. The scheme is built on a level-restricted adaptive octree data structure, and therefore, it is compatible with highly nonuniform discretizations. Furthermore, the scheme is coupled with high-order accurate locally-corrected Nyström quadrature methods to integrate the singular and weakly-singular Green’s functions used in the integral representations. Our method has immediate applications to a variety of problems in computational physics. We concentrate here on studying its performance in acoustic scattering (governed by the Helmholtz equation) at low to moderate frequencies, and provide rigorous justification for compression of submatrices via proxy surfaces.",

The spectrum of the Koopman operator has been shown to encode many important statistical and geometric properties of a dynamical system. In this work, we consider induced linear operators acting on the space of sections of the state space’s tangent, cotangent, and tensor bundles. We first demonstrate how these operators are natural generalizations of Koopman operators acting on functions. We then draw connections between the various operators’ spectra and characterize the algebraic and differential topological properties of their spectra. We describe the discrete spectrum of these operators for linear dynamical systems and derive spectral expansions for linear vector fields. We define the notion of an “eigendistribution,” provide conditions for an eigendistribution to be integrable, and demonstrate how to recover the foliations arising from their integral manifolds. Last, we demonstrate that the characteristic Lyapunov exponents of a uniformly hyperbolic dynamical system are in the spectrum of the induced operators on sections of the tangent or cotangent bundle. We conclude with an application to differential geometry where the well-known fact that the flows of commuting vector fields commute is generalized, and we recover the original statement as a particular case of our result.

Developing a model to capture all aspects of a complex dynamical system is an immense task, and each model will have deficiencies in some areas, such as global climate models having difficulty in capturing tropical intraseasonal variability such as the Madden–Julian oscillation. Besides complex models, it is possible to create simplified, low-dimensional models to capture specific phenomena while ignoring many aspects of the full system. Here, we propose a strategy to allow complex models to communicate with simplified models throughout a simulation. The communication allows one to leverage the strengths of each model, without needing to change their dynamics, to mitigate model error. Furthermore, to ensure ease of implementation in complex systems, the strategy is based on common data assimilation techniques that are normally used to combine models and real-world data. This strategy is investigated here in a test case that is nonlinear, non-Gaussian, and high-dimensional (approximately [math] degrees of freedom), and the multiple models have different state spaces. In particular, it is an idealized tropical climate model in three spatial dimensions. The multimodel communication strategy is seen to mitigate model error and reproduce statistical features akin to those of the truth model when the communication is sufficiently frequent. In these tests, the low-dimensional model contributes only two degrees of freedom, which suggests that, in some systems, large amounts of model error can possibly be reduced by focusing on a small set of model components.",

Because of the significance of remediating contaminated ecosystems, many mathematical models have been developed to describe the interactions between populations and toxicants in polluted aquatic environments. These models typically neglect the consequences of toxicant-induced behavioral changes on population dynamics. Taking into account that individuals may flee from areas with high toxicant concentrations to areas with low toxicant concentrations in order to improve their chances of survival, growth, and reproduction, we develop a diffusive population-toxicant model with toxicant-taxis. We establish the global well-posedness of our model and prove the global stability of spatially homogeneous toxicant-only steady states and population-toxicant coexistence steady states under some conditions. We find conditions under which stable spatially inhomogeneous steady states become unstable to trigger spatial pattern formations as the toxicant-taxis is strong. We also identify a narrow parameter regime in which toxicant-only and population-toxicant coexistence steady states are bistable. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate that spatial aggregation and segregation patterns between the population and the toxicant will typically emerge. Our study highlights the important effects of toxicant-induced movement responses on the spatial distributions of populations in polluted aquatic environments.",

One of the most important branches of nonlinear control theory of dynamical systems is the so-called sliding mode. Its aim is the design of a (nonlinear) feedback law that brings and maintains the state trajectory of a dynamic system on a given sliding surface. Here, dynamics become completely independent of the model parameters and can be tuned accordingly to the desired target. In this paper we study this problem when the feedback law is subject to strong structural constraints. In particular, we assume that the control input may take values only over two bounded and disjoint sets. Such sets could be also not perfectly known a priori. An example is a control input allowed to switch only between two values. Under these peculiarities, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee sliding-mode control effectiveness for a class of time-varying continuous-time linear systems that includes all the stationary state-space linear models. Our analysis covers several scientific fields. It is only apparently confined to the linear setting and also allows one study an important set of nonlinear models. We describe fundamental examples related to epidemiology where the control input is the level of contact rate among people and the sliding surface permits to control the number of infected. We prove the global convergence of epidemic sliding-mode control schemes applied to two popular dynamical systems used in epidemiology, i.e., SEIR and SAIR, and based on the introduction of severe restrictions like lockdowns. Results obtained in the literature regarding control of many other epidemiological models are also generalized by casting them within a general sliding-mode theory.",

The existence of HIV post-treatment controllers (PTCs) offers hope for an HIV functional cure, and understanding the critical mechanisms determining PTC represents a key step toward this goal. Here, we have studied these mechanisms by analyzing an established mathematical model for HIV viral dynamics. In mathematical models, critical mechanisms are represented by parameters that affect the tipping points to induce qualitatively different dynamics, and in cases with multiple stability, the initial conditions of the system also play a role in determining the fate of the solution. As such, for the tipping points in parameter space, we developed and implemented a sensitivity analysis of the threshold conditions of the associated bifurcations to identify the critical mechanisms for this model. Our results suggest that the infected cell death rate and the saturation parameter for cytotoxic T lymphocyte proliferation significantly affect post-treatment control. For the case with multiple stability, in state space of initial conditions, we first investigated the saddle-type equilibrium point to identify its stable manifold, which delimits trapping regions associated to the high and low viral set points. The identified stable manifold serves as a guide for the loads of immune cells and HIV virus at the time of therapy termination to achieve post-treatment control.",

The study of emergent behavior of swarms is of great interest for applied sciences. One of the most fundamental questions for self-organizing swarms is whether the swarms disperse or remain in a spatially cohesive configuration. In this paper we study dissipativity properties and spatial cohesiveness of the swarm of self-propelled particles governed by the model [math], where [math], [math], and [math] is a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix. The self-propulsion term is assumed to be continuously differentiable and to grow faster than [math], that is, [math] as [math]. We establish that the velocity and acceleration of the particles are ultimately bounded. We show that when [math] is trivial, the positions of the particles are also ultimately bounded. For systems with [math], we show that, while the system might infinitely drift away from its initial location, the particles remain within a bounded distance from the generalized center of mass of the system, which geometrically coincides with the weighted average of agent positions. The weights are determined by the coefficients of the projection matrix onto [math]. We also discuss the ultimate boundedness for systems with bounded coupling, including the Morse potential systems, and systems governed by power-law potentials with strong repulsion properties. We show that the former systems are ultimately bounded in the velocity-acceleration domain, whereas the models based on the power-law potentials are not.",

The circadian clock is an internal timer that coordinates the daily rhythms of behavior and physiology, including sleep and hormone secretion. Accurately tracking the state of the circadian clock, or circadian phase, holds immense potential for precision medicine. Wearable devices present an opportunity to estimate the circadian phase in the real world, as they can noninvasively monitor various physiological outputs influenced by the circadian clock. However, accurately estimating circadian phase from wearable data remains challenging, primarily due to the lack of methods that integrate minute-by-minute wearable data with prior knowledge of the circadian phase. To address this issue, we propose a framework that integrates multitime scale physiological data and estimates the circadian phase, along with an efficient implementation algorithm based on Bayesian inference and a new state space estimation method called the level set Kalman filter. Our numerical experiments indicate that our approach outperforms previous methods for circadian phase estimation consistently. Furthermore, our method enables us to examine the contribution of noise from different sources to the estimation, which was not feasible with prior methods. We found that internal noise unrelated to external stimuli is a crucial factor in determining estimation results. Last, we developed a user-friendly computational package and applied it to real-world data to demonstrate the potential value of our approach. Our results provide a foundation for systematically understanding the real-world dynamics of the circadian clock.",

Our objective is to find distributions of resources that maximize these persistence measures. We begin our study by considering stream networks consisting of three nodes and prove that the strategy to maximize the total biomass is to concentrate all the resources in the most upstream locations.

Laws of large numbers guarantee that given a large enough sample from some population, the measure of any fixed subpopulation is well-estimated by its frequency in the sample. We study laws of large numbers in sampling processes that can affect the environment they are acting upon and interact with it. Specifically, we consider the sequential sampling model proposed by [O.

Yogev, The adversarial robustness of sampling, in Proceedings of the 39th ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGAI Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS), 2020, pp. 49–62] and characterize the classes which admit a uniform law of large numbers in this model: these are exactly the classes that are online learnable. Our characterization may be interpreted as an online analogue to the equivalence between learnability and uniform convergence in statistical (PAC) learning. The sample-complexity bounds we obtain are tight for many parameter regimes, and as an application, we determine the optimal regret bounds in online learning, stated in terms of Littlestone’s dimension, thus resolving the main open question from [S.
