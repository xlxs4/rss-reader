          "description": "Abstract\nRestoring natural images corrupted by Cauchy noise is a challenging issue in image processing. In the existing methods, the traditional model-driven and filter-based methods can not recover the images well, and the learning-based plug-and-play method lacks convergence guarantees. In this paper, we propose a convergent plug-and-play method with outliers detection (C-PnPO) to remove Cauchy noise. The outlier detection is based on an outlier map regularized by maximum entropy. Due to the statistical properties of Cauchy distribution and the implicit deep image priors, the problem is non-convex and implicit. We present a convergent algorithm to address these issues by an adaptively relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers. Theoretically, we give some useful mathematical properties, including the existence of solutions under mild assumptions, and the global linear convergence of the proposed method by an adaptive relaxation strategy. Experimental results show that the outliers can be successfully detected, and the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-art traditional and learning-based methods both in terms of quantitative and qualitative comparisons.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we develop a new free-stream preserving (FP) method for high-order upwind conservative finite-difference (FD) schemes on curvilinear grids. This FP method is constructed by subtracting a reference cell-face flow state from each cell-center value in the local stencil of the original upwind schemes, which effectively leads to a reformulated dissipation. It is convenient to implement this method, as it only approximates the cell-center fluxes and conservative variables before reconstructions rather than performs the FP techniques for the central and dissipation parts individually, which avoids introducing considerable complexities to the original reconstruction procedures. In addition, the proposed method removes the constraint in the traditional FP conservative FD schemes that require a consistent scheme for the metrics discretization and the central part of fluxes discretization. With this, the proposed method is more flexible in simulating the engineering problems which usually require a low-order scheme for their low-quality mesh, while the high-order schemes can be applied to approximate the flow states to improve the resolution. After demonstrating the strict FP property and the order of accuracy by two simple test cases, we consider various validation cases, including the supersonic flow around the cylinder, the subsonic flow past the three-element airfoil, and the transonic flow around the ONERA M6 wing, etc., to show that the method is suitable for a wide range of fluid dynamic problems containing complex geometries.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose a stochastic Gauss–Newton (SGN) algorithm to study the online principal component analysis (OPCA) problem, which is formulated by using the symmetric low-rank product model for dominant eigenspace calculation. Compared with existing OPCA solvers, SGN is of improved robustness with respect to the varying input data and algorithm parameters. In addition, turning to an evaluation of data stream based on approximated objective functions, we develop a new adaptive stepsize strategy for SGN which requires no priori knowledge of the input data, and numerically illustrate its comparable performance with SGN adopting the manaully-tuned diminishing stepsize. Without assuming the eigengap to be positive, we also establish the global and optimal convergence rate of SGN with the specified stepsize using the diffusion approximation theory.",

It is well known that the WR method decouples or linearizes large-scale complex systems into simple subsystems, which in most cases can be computed in parallel in each iteration. To accelerate the calculation of the WR iteration, we apply a time-parallel approach: the Parareal algorithm, to solve the subsystems in each iteration. It can be thought of as a kind of space-time parallel method. According to different WR types, we present convergence analysis of the accelerated WR methods for the time-continuous case and for the time-discrete case with different discrete schemes. Besides, the speedup analysis of the proposed algorithms is also provided. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical works.",

          "description": "Abstract\nFor the discretization of the convective term in the Navier–Stokes equations, the commonly used convective formulation (CONV) does not preserve kinetic energy if the divergence constraint is only discretely enforced. In this paper, we apply the skew-symmetrization technique in Cockburn et al. (Math Comput 74(251):1067–1095, 2005. https://doi.org/10.1090/S0025-5718-04-01718-1) to conforming finite element methods, which restores energy conservation for CONV. The main idea is to replace the discrete advective velocity with an \n                      \n                      \\(H({\\text {div}})\\)\n                      \n                    -conforming divergence-free one in CONV. We prove that the modified convective formulation also conserves linear momentum, helicity, 2D enstrophy and total vorticity under some appropriate senses. The popular CNLE (linearly extrapolated Crank–Nicolson) method also conserves them when this modified formulation is used. Under the assumption \n                      \n                      \\(\\varvec{u}\\in L^{2}(0,T;\\varvec{W}^{1,\\infty }(\\Omega )),\\)\n                      \n                     it can be shown that the Gronwall constant does not explicitly depend on the Reynolds number in the error estimates.

          "description": "Abstract\nThe Laplace transform is a central mathematical tool for analysing 1D/2D signals and for the solution to PDEs; however, its definition and computation on arbitrary data is still an open research problem. We introduce the Laplace transform on arbitrary domains and focus on the spectral Laplace transform, which is defined by applying a 1D filter to the Laplacian spectrum of the input domain. The spectral Laplace transform satisfies standard properties of the 1D and 2D transforms, such as dilation, translation, scaling, derivation, localisation, and relations with the Fourier transform. The spectral Laplace transform is enough general to be applied to signals defined on different discrete data, such as graphs, 3D surface meshes, and point sets. Working in the spectral domain and applying polynomial and rational polynomial approximations, we achieve a stable computation of the spectral Laplace Transform. As main applications, we discuss the computation of the spectral Laplace Transform of functions defined on arbitrary domains (e.g., 2D and 3D surfaces, graphs), the solution of the heat diffusion equation, and graph signal processing.",

In this paper we revisit a two-level discretization based on localized orthogonal decomposition (LOD). It was originally proposed in [P. Henning, A. Målqvist, and D. Peterseim, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 52 (2014), pp. 1525–1550] to compute ground states of Bose–Einstein condensates by finding discrete minimizers of the Gross–Pitaevskii energy functional. The established convergence rates for the method appeared, however, suboptimal compared to numerical observations and a proof of optimal rates in this setting remained open. In this paper we shall close this gap by proving optimal order error estimates for the [math]- and [math]-errors between the exact ground state and discrete minimizers, as well as error estimates for the ground state energy and the ground state eigenvalue. In particular, the achieved convergence rates for the energy and the eigenvalue are of 6th order with respect to the mesh size on which the discrete LOD space is based, without making any additional regularity assumptions. These high rates justify the use of very coarse meshes, which significantly reduces the computational effort for finding accurate approximations of ground states. In addition, we include numerical experiments that confirm the optimality of the new theoretical convergence rates, for both smooth and discontinuous potentials.",

We consider the effect of time-periodic forcing on a one-dimensional Schrödinger equation with a topologically protected defect (edge) mode. The unforced system models a domain wall or dislocation defect in a periodic structure, and it supports a defect mode which bifurcates from the Dirac point (linear band crossing) of the underlying bulk medium. We study the robustness of this state against time-periodic forcing of the type that arises in the study of Floquet topological insulators in condensed matter, photonics, and cold-atoms systems. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that under time-periodic forcing of sufficiently high frequency, the defect state undergoes radiative leakage of its energy away from the interface into the bulk; the time-decay is exponential on a time scale proportional to the inverse square of the forcing amplitude. The envelope dynamics of our Floquet system are approximately governed, on long time scales, by an effective (homogenized) periodically forced Dirac equation. Multiple scale analysis of the effective envelope dynamics yields an expansion of the radiating solution, which shows excellent agreement with our numerical simulations.",

In particular, it is shown that perturbed trajectories can tend to the equilibrium of the limiting system or that new stochastically stable states can arise.

How does a group of agents break indecision when deciding about options with qualities that are hard to distinguish? Biological and artificial multiagent systems, from honeybees and bird flocks to bacteria, robots, and humans, often need to overcome indecision when choosing among options in situations in which the performance or even the survival of the group is at stake. Breaking indecision is also important because in a fully indecisive state, where agents are not biased toward any specific option, the agent group is maximally sensitive and prone to adapt to inputs and changes in its environment. Here, we develop a mathematical theory to study how decisions arise from the breaking of indecision. Our approach is grounded in both equivariant and network bifurcation theory. We model decision from indecision as synchrony-breaking in influence networks in which each node is the value assigned by an agent to an option. First, we show that three universal decision behaviors, namely, deadlock, consensus, and dissensus, are the generic outcomes of synchrony-breaking bifurcations from a fully synchronous state of indecision in influence networks. Second, we show that all deadlock and consensus value patterns and some dissensus value patterns are predicted by the symmetry of the influence networks. Third, we show that there are also many “exotic” dissensus value patterns. These patterns are predicted by network architecture but not by network symmetries through a new synchrony-breaking branching lemma. This is the first example of exotic solutions in an application. Numerical simulations of a novel influence network model illustrate our theoretical results.",

The goal of this study is to develop a computer-assisted method for proving the existence of periodic solutions for state-dependent delayed perturbations of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We assume that the unperturbed ODE has an isolated periodic orbit, and derive a set of polynomial inequalities which, if satisfied, imply the existence and uniqueness of a periodic solution in the perturbed system. A general procedure is given, which facilitates the computation of the polynomial coefficients and the optimization of the inputs necessary to satisfy the inequalities on an explicit range of the perturbing parameter. Our approach uses tools from validated numerics and interval arithmetic together with Chebyshev series expansions to obtain the periodic orbit of the ODE as well as the solution of the variational equations. The general procedure is illustrated by proving the existence of some periodic orbits in state-dependent delayed perturbations of the van der Pol equation.",

Fluids subject to both thermal and compositional variations can undergo doubly diffusive convection when these properties both affect the fluid density and diffuse at different rates. A variety of patterns can arise from these buoyancy-driven flows, including spatially localized states known as convectons, which consist of convective fluid motion localized within a background of quiescent fluid. We consider these states in a vertical slot with the horizontal temperature and solutal gradients providing competing effects to the fluid density while allowing the existence of a conduction state. In this configuration, convectons have been studied with specific parameter values where the onset of convection is subcritical, and the states have been found to lie on a pair of secondary branches that undergo homoclinic snaking in a parameter regime below the onset of linear instability. In this paper, we show that convectons persist into parameter regimes in which the primary bifurcation is supercritical and there is no bistability, despite coexistence between the stable conduction state and large-amplitude convection. We detail this transition by considering spatial dynamics and observe how the structure of the secondary branches becomes increasingly complex owing to the increased role of inertia at low Prandtl numbers.",

Precise conditions are provided for the existence and criticality of Turing bifurcations in a general class of activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion equations on a one-dimensional infinite domain. The class includes generalized Schnakenberg and Brusselator models, as well as other models with cubic autocatalytic nonlinear terms. Previous numerical work suggests the existence of a bifurcation structure containing localized patterns due to the so-called homoclinic snaking mechanism. This paper provides explicit calculations to justify those results. Two distinct scalings of parameters that lead to tractable normal-form coefficients are considered in the limit that the diffusion ratio [math]. First, under a small-parameter scaling, the Turing bifurcation is shown to be always subcritical. Second, a large-parameter scaling reveals the Turing bifurcation to be supercritical, leading, by continuity, to the existence of a codimension-two degenerate bifurcation. The sign of a fifth-order normal form coefficient is also computed, which is shown to have the correct sign for the local birth of homoclinic snaking. For the case of the Brusselator, two such codimension-two points can be found explicitly, as can the leading-order expression for the Maxwell point, in a parameter wedge about which localized patterns emerge. Numerical results are found to be consistent with the theory.",

The Kuramoto model provides a prototypical framework for synchronization phenomena in interacting particle systems. Apart from full phase synchrony where all oscillators behave identically, identical Kuramoto oscillators with ring-like nonlocal coupling can exhibit more elaborate patterns such as uniformly twisted states. It was discovered by Wiley, Strogatz, and Girvan in 2006 that the stability of these twisted states depends on the coupling range of each oscillator. In this paper, we analyze twisted states and their bifurcations in the infinite particle limit of ring-like nonlocal coupling. We not only consider traditional pairwise interactions as in the Kuramoto model but also demonstrate the effects of higher-order nonpairwise interactions, which arise naturally in phase reductions. We elucidate how pairwise and nonpairwise interactions affect the stability of the twisted states, compute bifurcating branches, and show that higher-order interactions can stabilize twisted states that are unstable if the coupling is only pairwise.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. Biological systems are known to be inherently uncertain and complex, and it is often difficult to justify rigorously functional forms used in a mathematical model. Generally, one chooses some simple function having qualitatively correct behavior without concern for the precise choice of function; the assumption has been that qualitatively similar functions will produce qualitatively similar behavior from the model. However, it has been shown that, in some cases, the qualitative predictions from a model are sensitive to the particular functional form used; this property is known as structural sensitivity. A promising tool for quantification of structural sensitivity is the use of partially specified models, in which some number of functions in equations are not defined explicitly. However, in this approach we cannot rely on the traditional parameter-based framework, where all functional forms are well defined but contain parameters to be determined. The main difficulties are that, mathematically, we need to deal with an infinite-dimensional function space and that a well-defined measure on that space is needed. We propose a novel framework to reveal the structural sensitivity and quantify uncertainty in partially specified biological models based on ordinary differential equations backed up by empirical data. Our method uses path integration, previously introduced in theoretical physics. As an insightful example, we explore structural sensitivity of a well-known tritrophic food chain model in which the functional response of the predator is uncertain, using available experimental data on protozoan predation on bacteria.

Motivated by the issue of COVID-19 mitigation, in this work we tackle the general problem of optimally controlling an epidemic outbreak of a communicable disease structured by age since exposure, with the aid of two types of control instruments, namely social distancing and vaccination by a vaccine at least partly effective in protecting from infection. By our analyses we could prove the existence of (at least) one optimal control pair. We derived first-order necessary conditions for optimality and proved some useful properties of such optimal solutions. Our general model can be specialized to include a number of subcases relevant for epidemics like COVID-19, such as, e.g., the arrival of vaccines in a second stage of the epidemic, and vaccine rationing, making social distancing the only optimizable instrument.

Habitats larger than the critical patch size allow a population to persist, while smaller habitats lead to extinction. We perform a rigorous derivation of the critical patch size associated with a 2-population glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model that divides the tumor cells into proliferating and quiescent/necrotic populations. We determine that the critical patch size of our model is consistent with that of the Fisher–Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov equation, one of the first reaction-diffusion models proposed for GBM, and does not depend on parameters pertaining to the quiescent/necrotic population. The critical patch size may indicate that GBM tumors have a minimum size depending on the location in the brain. We also derive a theoretical relationship between the size of a GBM tumor at steady-state and its maximum cell density, which has potential applications for patient-specific parameter estimation based on magnetic resonance imaging data.

Spatial systems with heterogeneities are ubiquitous in nature, from precipitation, temperature, and soil gradients controlling vegetation growth to morphogen gradients controlling gene expression in embryos. Such systems, generally described by nonlinear dynamical systems, often display complex parameter dependence and exhibit bifurcations. The dynamics of heterogeneous spatially extended systems passing through bifurcations are still relatively poorly understood, yet recent theoretical studies and experimental data highlight the resulting complex behaviors and their relevance to real-world applications. We explore the consequences of spatial heterogeneities passing through bifurcations via two examples strongly motivated by applications. These model systems illustrate that studying heterogeneity-induced behaviors in spatial systems is crucial for a better understanding of ecological transitions and functional organization in brain development.",

Inverse problems of recovering space-dependent parameters, e.g., initial condition, space-dependent source, or potential coefficient in a subdiffusion model from the terminal observation have been extensively studied in recent years. However, all existing studies have assumed that the terminal time at which one takes the observation is exactly known. In this work, we present uniqueness and stability results for three canonical inverse problems, e.g., backward problem, inverse source, and inverse potential problems from the terminal observation at an unknown time. The subdiffusive nature of the problem indicates that one can simultaneously determine the terminal time and space-dependent parameter. The analysis is based on explicit solution representations, asymptotic behavior of the Mittag–Leffler function, and mild regularity conditions on the problem data. Further, we present several one- and two-dimensional numerical experiments to illustrate the feasibility of the approach.",

Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, is a systemic neurological disorder associated with the formation of toxic, pathological aggregates of proteins within the brain that lead to severe cognitive decline, and eventually, death. In normal physiological conditions, the brain rids itself of toxic proteins using various clearance mechanisms. The efficacy of brain clearance can be adversely affected by the presence of toxic proteins and is also known to decline with age. Motivated by recent findings, such as the connection between brain cerebrospinal fluid clearance and sleep, we propose a mathematical model coupling the progression of toxic proteins over the brain’s structural network and protein clearance. The model is used to study the interplay between clearance in the brain, toxic seeding, brain network connectivity, aging, and progression in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for the growing body of medical research showing that clearance plays an important role in the etiology, progression, and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.",

For a fixed finite collection of graphs [math] the [math]-M-Deletion problem is as follows: given an [math]-vertex input graph [math] find the minimum number of vertices that intersect all minor models in [math] of the graphs in [math]. by Courcelle’s Theorem, this problem can be solved in time [math] where [math] is the treewidth of [math] for some function [math] depending on [math].
