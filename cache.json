          "description": "Abstract\nThe reconstruction of images from measured data is an increasing field of research. For highly under-determined problems, template-based image reconstruction provides a way of compensating for the lack of sufficient data. A caveat of this approach is that dealing with different topologies of the template and the target image is challenging. In this paper, we propose a LDDMM-based image-reconstruction model that resolves this issue by adding a source term. On the theoretical side, we show that the model satisfies all criteria for being a well-posed regularization method. For the implementation, we pursue a discretize-then-optimize approach involving the proximal alternating linearized minimization algorithm, which is known to converge under mild assumptions. Our simulations with both artificial and real data confirm the robustness of the method, and its ability to successfully deal with topology changes even if the available amount of data is very limited.",

In this paper we investigate the possibility of exploiting mixed precision computing in LSQR for solving discrete linear ill-posed problems. Based on the commonly used regularization model for linear inverse problems, we analyze the choice of proper computing precision in the two main parts of LSQR, including the construction of Krylov subspace and updating procedure of iterative solutions. We show that, under some mild conditions, the Lanczos vectors can be computed using single precision without loss of any accuracy of the final regularized solution as long as the noise level is not extremely small. We also show that the most time consuming part for updating iterative solutions can be performed using single precision without sacrificing any accuracy. The results indicate that several highly time consuming parts of the algorithm can be implemented using lower precisions, and provide a theoretical guideline for implementing a robust and efficient mixed precision variant of LSQR for solving discrete linear ill-posed problems. Numerical experiments are made to test two mixed precision variants of LSQR and confirming our results.",

          "description": "Multiscale Modeling & Simulation, Volume 22, Issue 1, Page 230-255, March 2024. \n Abstract. Sea ice profoundly influences the polar environment and the global climate. Traditionally, sea ice has been modeled as a continuum under Eulerian coordinates to describe its large-scale features, using, for instance, viscous-plastic rheology. Recently, Lagrangian particle models, also known as the discrete element method models, have been utilized for characterizing the motion of individual sea ice fragments (called floes) at scales of 10 km and smaller, especially in marginal ice zones. This paper develops a multiscale model that couples the particle and the continuum systems to facilitate an effective representation of the dynamical and statistical features of sea ice across different scales. The multiscale model exploits a Boltzmann-type system that links the particle movement with the continuum equations. For the small-scale dynamics, it describes the motion of each sea ice floe. Then, as the large-scale continuum component, it treats the statistical moments of mass density and linear and angular velocities. The evolution of these statistics affects the motion of individual floes, which in turn provides bulk feedback that adjusts the large-scale dynamics. Notably, the particle model characterizing the sea ice floes is localized and fully parallelized in a framework that is sometimes called superparameterization, which significantly improves computational efficiency. Numerical examples demonstrate the effective performance of the multiscale model. Additionally, the study demonstrates that the multiscale model has a linear-order approximation to the truth model.",

Using an approximation to the homoclinic solutions derived with a generalized Lindstedt–Poincaré method, we develop a method to initialize the continuation of the homoclinic bifurcation curves emanating from these points. The normal form transformation is derived in the functional analytic perturbation framework for dual semigroups (sun-star calculus) using a normalization technique based on the Fredholm alternative.

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 505-552, March 2024. \n Abstract. Traditional sensitivity analysis methods fail for chaotic systems due to the unstable characteristics of the linearized equations. To overcome these issues two methods have been developed in the literature, one being the shadowing approach, which results in a minimization problem, and the other being numerical viscosity, where a damping term is added to the linearized equations to suppress the instability. The shadowing approach is computationally expensive but produces accurate sensitivities, while numerical viscosity can produce less accurate sensitivities but with significantly reduced computational cost. However, it is not fully clear how the solutions generated by these two approaches compare to each other. In this work we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a control term, found with optimal control theory techniques, to prevent the exponential growth of solution of the linearized equations. We will refer to this method as optimal control shadowing. We investigate the computational aspects and performance of this new method on the Lorenz and Kuramoto–Sivashinsky systems and compare its performance with simple numerical viscosity schemes. We show that the tangent solution generated by the proposed approach is similar to that generated by shadowing methods, suggesting that optimal control attempts to stabilize the unstable shadowing direction. Further, for the spatially extended system, we examine the energy budget of the tangent equation and show that the control term found via the solution of the optimal control problem acts only at length scales where production of tangent energy dominates dissipation, which is not necessarily the case for the numerical viscosity methods.",

We propose a general strategy for reduced order modeling of systems that display highly nonlinear oscillations. By considering a continuous family of forced periodic orbits defined in relation to a stable fixed point and subsequently leveraging phase-amplitude-based reduction strategies, we arrive at a low order model capable of accurately capturing nonlinear oscillations resulting from arbitrary external inputs. In the limit that oscillations are small, the system dynamics relax to those obtained from local linearization, i.e., that can be fully described using linear eigenmodes. For larger amplitude oscillations, the behavior can be understood in terms of the dynamics of a small number of nonlinear modes. We illustrate the proposed strategy in a variety of examples yielding results that are substantially better than those obtained using standard linearization-based techniques.",

This paper is mainly concerned with limiting behaviors of invariant measures for neural field lattice models in a random environment. First of all, we consider the convergence relation of invariant measures between the stochastic neural field lattice model and the corresponding deterministic model in weighted spaces, and prove any limit of a sequence of invariant measures of such a lattice model must be an invariant measure of its limiting system as the noise intensity tends to zero. Then we are devoted to studying the numerical approximation of invariant measures of such a stochastic neural lattice model. To this end, we first consider convergence of invariant measures between such a neural lattice model and the system with neurons only interacting with its n-neighborhood; then we further prove the convergence relation of invariant measures between the system with an n-neighborhood and its finite dimensional truncated system. By this procedure, the invariant measure of the stochastic neural lattice models can be approximated by the numerical invariant measure of a finite dimensional truncated system based on the backward Euler–Maruyama (BEM) scheme. Therefore, the invariant measure of a deterministic neural field lattice model can be observed by the invariant measure of the BEM scheme when the noise is not negligible.",

Generalized mass-action systems are power-law dynamical systems arising from chemical reaction networks. Essentially, every nonnegative ODE model used in chemistry and biology (for example, in ecology and epidemiology) and even in economics and engineering can be written in this form. Previous results have focused on existence and uniqueness of special steady states (complex-balanced equilibria) for all rate constants, thereby ruling out multiple (special) steady states. Recently, necessary conditions for linear stability have been obtained. In this work, we provide sufficient conditions for the linear stability of complex-balanced equilibria for all rate constants (and also for the nonexistence of other steady states). In particular, via sign vector conditions (on the stoichiometric coefficients and kinetic orders), we guarantee that the Jacobian matrix is a [math]-matrix. Technically, we use a new decomposition of the graph Laplacian which allows us to consider orders of (generalized) monomials. Alternatively, we use cycle decomposition which allows a linear parametrization of all Jacobian matrices. In any case, we guarantee stability without explicit computation of steady states. We illustrate our results in examples from chemistry and biology: generalized Lotka–Volterra systems and SIR models, a two-component signaling system, and an enzymatic futile cycle.",

To overcome some limits of classical neuronal models, we propose a Markovian generalization of the classical model based on Jacobi processes by introducing downwards jumps to describe the activity of a single neuron. The statistical analysis of interspike intervals is performed by studying the first passage times of the proposed Markovian Jacobi process with jumps through a constant boundary. In particular, we characterize its Laplace transform, which is expressed in terms of some generalization of hypergeometric functions that we introduce, and deduce a closed-form expression for its expectation. Our approach, which is original in the context of first-passage-time problems, relies on intertwining relations between the semigroups of the classical Jacobi process and its generalization, which have been recently established in [P. Cheridito et al., J. Ec. Polytech. - Math., 8 (2021), pp. 331–378].

The mechanism of seed dispersal mutualism is fundamental to understanding vegetation diversity and its conservation. In this study, we propose a stochastic model that extends the classical framework of seed dispersal mutualism to explore the effects of environmental stochasticity on mutualistic interactions between seed dispersers and plants. We first provide a comprehensive picture of the long-term dynamics of seed dispersal mutualism in deterministic and stochastic environments. We then analyze the relationship between stochasticity and the probability and time that seed dispersal mutualism tips between stable states. Additionally, we evaluate the extinction risk of seed dispersal mutualism for different population values and accordingly assign extinction warning levels to these values. The analysis reveals that the impact of environmental stochasticity on tipping phenomena is scenario-dependent but follows some interpretable trends. The probability (resp., time) of tipping towards the extinction state typically increases (resp., decreases) monotonically with noise intensity, while the probability of tipping towards the coexistence state typically peaks at intermediate noise intensity. Noise in animal populations contributes to tipping toward the coexistence state, whereas noise in plant populations slows down the tipping toward the coexistence state. Noise-induced changes in warning levels of initial population values are most pronounced near the boundaries of the basin of attraction, but sufficiently loud noise (especially for plant populations) may alter the risk far from these boundaries. These findings provide a theoretical explanation for the effect of environmental stochasticity on multistability transitions in seed dispersal mutualism and can be utilized to study the interplay between other population systems and environmental stochasticity.",

If microbes are also distributed in space, then those resources are subject to transport limitations (encoded in a PDE) and so microbial strategies at one location influence resources and, hence, microbial strategies, at another.
