          "description": "Abstract\nWe study numerical algorithms for solving Biot’s model. Based on a three-field reformulation, we present some algorithms that are inspired by the work of Chaabane et al. (Comput Math Appl 75(7):2328–2337) and Lee (Unconditionally stable second order convergent partitioned methods for multiple-network poroelasticity arXiv:1901.06078, 2019) for decoupling the computation of Biot’s model. A new theoretical framework is developed to analyze the algorithms. Considering a uniform temporal discretization, these algorithms solve the coupled model on the first time level. On the remaining time levels, one algorithm solves a reaction-diffusion subproblem first and then solves a generalized Stokes subproblem. Another algorithm reverses the order of solving the two subproblems. Our algorithms manage to decouple the numerical computation of the coupled system while retaining the convergence properties of the original coupled algorithm. Theoretical analysis is conducted to show that these algorithms are unconditionally stable and optimally convergent. Numerical experiments are also carried out to validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithms.",

          "description": "Abstract\nSeismic data is contaminated by noise due to a variety of factors including wind, ocean currents, vehicular traffic, and construction. Further receiver malfunction and limitations in acquisition geometry may lead to missing data. Seismic data naturally contains redundancies because surveys repeatedly sample the same region of the subsurface. If this data is organized into a high-dimensional data structure (a tensor), then the incomplete noisy data will have higher rank than the ground truth data. Direct rank reduction for tensors is an NP-hard problem. Thus one instead minimizes an approximation to rank such as the tensor nuclear norm (TNN), which sums the tensor’s singular values. This TNN model together with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization method is denoted TNN-ADMM. While convergence of ADMM has been shown previously for general minimization of functions, here we formulate tensor properties which allow us to prove a sufficient condition: by bounding the step size to be greater than one, the Lagrangian function is strictly decreasing and bounded. Therefore, ADMM applied to the TNN model converges. This condition reduces the computational burden of tuning the step size parameter. We demonstrate the performance of denoising and reconstruction on two synthetic seismic datasets and on a real dataset from offshore Western Australia. In the case of the linear synthetic data, TNN-ADMM out-performs another popular method by giving four times less error in half the computational time. We also illustrate that TNN-ADMM can effectively remove the majority of artificially added noise to real data.",

          "description": "Abstract\nBalanced truncation is a well-established model order reduction method which has been applied to a variety of problems. Recently, a connection between linear Gaussian Bayesian inference problems and the system-theoretic concept of balanced truncation has been drawn (Qian et al in Sci Comput 91:29, 2022). Although this connection is new, the application of balanced truncation to data assimilation is not a novel idea: it has already been used in four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var). This paper discusses the application of balanced truncation to linear Gaussian Bayesian inference, and, in particular, the 4D-Var method, thereby strengthening the link between systems theory and data assimilation further. Similarities between both types of data assimilation problems enable a generalisation of the state-of-the-art approach to the use of arbitrary prior covariances as reachability Gramians. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced approach using time-limited balanced truncation that allows to balance Bayesian inference for unstable systems and in addition improves the numerical results for short observation periods.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe solution of nonlinear inverse problems is a challenging task in numerical analysis. In most cases, this kind of problems is solved by iterative procedures that, at each iteration, linearize the problem in a neighborhood of the currently available approximation of the solution. The linearized problem is then solved by a direct or iterative method. Among this class of solution methods, the Gauss–Newton method is one of the most popular ones. We propose an efficient implementation of this method for large-scale problems. Our implementation is based on projecting the nonlinear problem into a sequence of nested subspaces, referred to as Generalized Krylov Subspaces, whose dimension increases with the number of iterations, except for when restarts are carried out. When the computation of the Jacobian matrix is expensive, we combine our iterative method with secant (Broyden) updates to further reduce the computational cost. We show convergence of the proposed solution methods and provide a few numerical examples that illustrate their performance.",

Firstly, the well-posedness and regularities of the model are studied by using the bivariate Mittag-Leffler function. Theoretical results show that after introducing the first-order derivative operator, the regularity of the solution can be improved in substance. Then, a numerical scheme with high-precision is developed no matter the initial value is smooth or non-smooth. More specifically, we use the contour integral method (CIM) with parameterized hyperbolic contour to approximate the temporal local and non-local operators, and employ the standard Galerkin finite element method for spatial discretization. Rigorous error estimates show that the proposed numerical scheme has spectral accuracy in time and optimal convergence order in space. Besides, we further improve the algorithm and reduce the computational cost by using the barycentric Lagrange interpolation. Finally, the obtained theoretical results as well as the acceleration algorithm are verified by several 1-D and 2-D numerical experiments, which also show that the numerical scheme developed in this paper is effective and robust.",

The new framework is highly versatile. First, it not only covers many existing algorithms such as PDHG, Chambolle–Pock, GDA, OGDA and linearized ALM, but also guides us to design a new efficient algorithm called Semi-OGDA (SOGDA). Second, it enables us to study the role of the augmented penalty term in the convergence analysis. Interestingly, a properly selected penalty not only improves the numerical performance of the above methods, but also theoretically enables the convergence of algorithms like PDHG and SOGDA. Under properly designed step sizes and penalty term, our unified framework preserves the \n                      \n                      \\({\\mathcal {O}}(1/N)\\)\n                      \n                     ergodic convergence while not requiring any prior knowledge about the magnitude of the optimal Lagrangian multiplier.

This becomes the obstacle to the development of fast and stable algorithms for computing partial quaternion eigenpairs. To overcome this difficulty, a new inverse quaternion iteration with quaternion shift is derived for solving general right quaternion eigenvalue problem. Fixed and updated quaternion shift techniques are developed to speed up the convergence. The advantage of quaternion shifts is explained geometrically, as well as the fact that real shifts may lead to wrong results. The convergence theory is built in a different way to that in real and complex cases. Numerical experiments on simulated data and color face database demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the newly proposed method over the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

High entropy alloys (HEAs) are a class of novel materials that exhibit superb engineering properties. It has been demonstrated by extensive experiments and first principles/atomistic simulations that short-range order in the atomic level randomness strongly influences the properties of HEAs. In this paper, we derive stochastic continuum models for HEAs with short-range order from atomistic models. A proper continuum limit is obtained such that the mean and variance of the atomic level randomness together with the short-range order described by a characteristic length are kept in the process from the atomistic interaction model to the continuum equation. The obtained continuum model with short-range order is in the form of an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process. This validates the continuum model based on the OU process adopted phenomenologically by Zhang et al. [Acta Mater., 166 (2019), pp. 424–434] for HEAs with short-range order. We derive such stochastic continuum models with short-range order for both (i) the elastic deformation in HEAs without defects and (ii) HEAs with dislocations (line defects). The obtained stochastic continuum models are based on the energy formulations, whose variations lead to stochastic partial differential equations.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems, Volume 22, Issue 4, Page 2693-2731, December 2023. \n Abstract. A wide variety of stationary or moving spatially localized structures is present in evolution problems on unbounded domains, governed by higher-than-second-order reversible spatial interactions. This work provides a generic unfolding in one spatial dimension of a certain codimension-three singularity that explains the organization of bifurcation diagrams of such localized states in a variety of contexts, ranging from nonlinear optics to fluid mechanics, mathematical biology, and beyond. The singularity occurs when a cusp bifurcation associated with the onset of bistability between homogeneous steady states encounters a pattern-forming, or Turing, bifurcation. The latter corresponds to a Hamiltonian-Hopf point of the corresponding spatial dynamics problem. Such codimension-three points are sometimes called Lifshitz points in the physics literature. In the simplest case where the spatial system conserves a first integral, the system is described by a canonical fourth-order scalar system. The problem contains three small parameters: two that unfold the cusp bifurcation and one that unfolds the Turing bifurcation. Several cases are revealed, depending on open conditions on the signs of the lowest-order nonlinear terms. Taking the case in which the Turing bifurcation is subcritical, various parameter regimes are considered and the bifurcation diagrams of localized structures are elucidated. A rich bifurcation structure is revealed which involves transitions between regions of localized periodic patterns generated by standard homoclinic snaking, and regions of stationary domains of one homogeneous solution embedded in the other organized in a collapsed snaking structure. The theory is shown to unify previous numerical results obtained in models arising in nonlinear optics, fluid mechanics, and excitable media more generally.",

A function with finite asymptotic limits gives rise to a transition equation between a “past system” and a “future system.” This question is analyzed in the case of nonautonomous coercive nonlinear scalar ordinary differential equations with concave derivative with respect to the state variable. The fundamental hypothesis is the existence of three hyperbolic solutions for the limit systems, in which case the upper and lower ones are attractive. All the global dynamical possibilities are described in terms of the internal dynamics of the pullback attractor: cases of tracking of the two hyperbolic attractive solutions or lack of it (tipping) may arise. This analysis, made in the language of processes and also in terms of the skewproduct formulation of the problem, includes cases of rate-induced critical transitions, as well as cases of phase-induced and size-induced tipping. The conclusions are applied in models of mathematical biology and population dynamics. Rate-induced tracking phenomena causing extinction of a native species or invasion of a nonnative one are described, as well as population models affected by a Holling type III functional response to predation where tipping due to the changes in the size of the transition may occur. In all these cases, the appearance of a critical transition can be understood as a consequence of the strength of the Allee effect.",

Recent work by public health experts suggests that incorporating human behavior is crucial in faithfully modeling an epidemic. We present a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation SIR-type population model for an epidemic including behavioral concerns. In our model, the disease spreads via mass action, as is customary in compartmental models. However, drawing from social contagion theory, we assume that as the disease spreads and prevention measures are enacted, noncompliance with prevention measures also spreads throughout the population. We prove global existence of classical solutions of our model, and then perform [math]-type analysis and determine asymptotic behavior of the model in different parameter regimes. Finally, we simulate the model and discuss the new facets which distinguish our model from basic SIR-type models.",

In the dynamic minimum set cover problem, the challenge is to minimize the update time while guaranteeing a close-to-optimal [math] approximation factor. (Throughout, [math], [math], [math], and [math] are parameters denoting the maximum number of elements, the number of sets, the frequency, and the cost range.) In the high-frequency range, when [math], this was achieved by a deterministic [math]-approximation algorithm with [math] amortized update time by Gupta et al. [Online and dynamic algorithms for set cover, in Proceedings STOC 2017, ACM, pp. 537–550]. In this paper we consider the low-frequency range, when [math], and obtain deterministic algorithms with a [math]-approximation ratio and the foll…",

We create a novel connection between Boltzmann sampling methods and Devroye’s algorithm to develop highly efficient sampling procedures that generate objects from important combinatorial classes with a given size [math] in expected time [math]. This performance is best possible and significantly improves the state of the art for samplers of subcritical graph classes (such as cactus graphs, outerplanar graphs, and series-parallel graphs), subcritical substitution-closed classes of permutations, Bienaymé–Galton–Watson trees conditioned on their number of leaves, and several further examples. Our approach allows for this high level of universality, as it applies in general to classes admitting bijective encodings by so-called enriched trees, which are rooted trees with additional structures on the offspring of each node.",
