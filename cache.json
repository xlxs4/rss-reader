          "description": "Abstract\nIn this article, a Fast Linear Elastic Eigenvalue Problem Solver (FLEEPS) is developed to calculate the band structures of three-dimensional (3D) isotropic phononic crystals (PnCs). In brief, FLEEPS solves in linear time complexity the smallest few eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of the linear elastic eigenvalue problem originating from the finite difference discretization of the frequency-domain linear elastic wave equation. Notably, FLEEPS employs the weighted singular value decomposition based preconditioner to greatly improve the convergence rate of the conjugate gradient iteration, and uses the fast Fourier transform algorithm to accelerate this preconditioner times a vector, based on the structured decomposition of the dense unitary factor T of this preconditioner. Band structure calculations of several 3D isotropic PnCs are presented to showcase the capabilities of FLEEPS. The preliminary MATLAB implementation of FLEEPS is available at https://github.com/FAME-GPU/FLEEPS-MATLAB.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose a reduced-order modeling strategy for two-way Dirichlet–Neumann parametric coupled problems solved with domain-decomposition (DD) sub-structuring methods. We split the original coupled differential problem into two sub-problems with Dirichlet and Neumann interface conditions, respectively. After discretization by, e.g., the finite element method, the full-order model (FOM) is solved by Dirichlet–Neumann iterations between the two sub-problems until interface convergence is reached. We then apply the reduced basis (RB) method to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the solution of each sub-problem. Furthermore, we apply the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) at the interface level to achieve a fully reduced-order representation of the DD techniques implemented. To deal with non-conforming FE interface discretizations, we employ the INTERNODES method combined with the interface DEIM reduction. The reduced-order model (ROM) is then solved by sub-iterating between the two reduced-order sub-problems until the convergence of the approximated high-fidelity interface solutions. The ROM scheme is numerically verified on both steady and unsteady coupled problems, in the case of non-conforming FE interfaces.",

          "description": "Abstract\nAn auxiliary optimal control problem is formulated that provides with its unique solution, a continuous representation of the global error of a numerical approximation to the solution of a linear quadratic optimal control problem. The resulting error functions are characterized as the unique solutions to an optimality system that is reformulated as a boundary value problem. With this formulation, reliable pointwise error estimates can be generated utilizing well-established techniques of defect control. A novel algorithm based on defect correction and defect control is presented that generates pointwise approximations to the global error of numerical optimal control solutions on a uniform grid. It is proven and numerically validated that this algorithm can generate pointwise estimates that approximate the true global error with a prescribed accuracy.",

The design of the “narrow-stencil-based” reconstruction operator can preserve the local data structure property of the high-order DG methods. With the RDG space, we apply the local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method with the implicit-explicit time marching for the nonlinear unsteady convection–diffusion–reaction equation, where the reduction of the number of DoFs allows us to achieve higher efficiency. In terms of theoretical analysis, we give the well-posedness and approximation properties for the reconstruction operator and the \n                      \n                      \\(L^2\\)\n                      \n                     error estimate for the semi-discrete LDG scheme.

          "description": "Abstract\nThis paper considers the regularization continuation method and the trust-region updating strategy for the nonlinearly equality-constrained optimization problem. Namely, it uses the inverse of the regularization quasi-Newton matrix as the pre-conditioner and the Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula to improve its computational efficiency in the well-posed phase, and it adopts the inverse of the regularization two-sided projection of the Hessian as the pre-conditioner to improve its robustness in the ill-conditioned phase. Since it only solves a linear system of equations and the Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula significantly saves the computational time at every iteration, and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method needs to solve a quadratic programming subproblem at every iteration, it is faster than SQP. Numerical results also show that it is more robust and faster than SQP (the built-in subroutine fmincon.m of the MATLAB2020a environment and the subroutine SNOPT executed in GAMS v28.2 (GAMS Corporation, 2019) environment). The computational time of the new method is about one third of that of fmincon.m for the large-scale problem. Finally, the global convergence analysis of the new method is also given.",

          "description": "Abstract\nThe Active Flux method is a third order accurate finite volume method for hyperbolic conservation laws, which is based on the use of point values as well as cell average values of the conserved quantities. The resulting method is fully discrete and has a compact stencil in space and time. An important component of Active Flux methods is the evolution formula for the update of the point values. A previously proposed exact evolution formula for acoustics is reviewed and used to construct an Active Flux method for the two-dimensional Maxwell’s equation. Furthermore, the method of bicharacteristics is discussed as a methodology for the derivation of truly multidimensional approximative evolution operators that can be used for the evolution of point values in Active Flux methods. We study accuracy and stability of the resulting methods for acoustics and compare with the Active Flux method that uses the exact evolution operator. Finally, we used the method of bicharacteristics to derive Cartesian grid Active Flux methods for the linearised and nonlinear Euler equations. Numerous test computations illustrate the performance of these new Active Flux methods.",

Nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations play a major role in modeling large systems of interacting particles with a proved effectiveness in describing real world phenomena ranging from classical fields such as fluids and plasma to social and biological dynamics. Their mathematical formulation often has to face physical forces having a significant random component or with particles living in a random environment whose characterization may be deduced through experimental data and leading consequently to uncertainty-dependent equilibrium states. In this work, to address the problem of effectively solving stochastic Fokker–Planck systems, we will construct a new equilibrium preserving scheme through a micro-macro approach based on stochastic Galerkin methods. The resulting numerical method, contrarily to the direct application of a stochastic Galerkin projection in the parameter space of the unknowns of the underlying Fokker–Planck model, leads to a highly accurate description of the uncertainty-dependent large time behavior. Several numerical tests in the context of collective behavior for social and life sciences are presented to assess the validity of the present methodology against standard ones.",

We are interested in the resonant electromagnetic scattering by all-dielectric metasurfaces made of a two-dimensional lattice of nanoparticles with high refractive indices. In [Ammari, Li, and Zou, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 376 (2023), pp. 39–90], it has been shown that a single high-index nanoresonator can couple with the incident wave and exhibit a strong magnetic dipole response. Recent physics experiments reveal that when the particles are arranged in certain periodic configurations, they may have different anomalous scattering effects in the macroscopic scale, compared to the single-particle case. In this work, we shall develop a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the resonant behaviors of all-dielectric metasurfaces. We start with the characterization of subwavelength scattering resonances in such a periodic setting and their asymptotic expansions in terms of the refractive index of the nanoparticles. Then we show that real resonances always exist below the essential spectrum of the periodic Maxwell operator and that they are the simple poles of the scattering resolvent with the exponentially decaying resonant modes. By using group theory, we discuss the implications of the symmetry of the metasurface on the subwavelength band functions and their associated eigenfunctions. For the symmetric metasurfaces with the normal incidence, we use a variational method to show the existence of embedded eigenvalues (i.e., real subwavelength resonances embedded in the continuous radiation spectrum). Furthermore, we break the configuration symmetry either by introducing a small deformation of particles or by slightly deviating from the normal incidence and prove that Fano-type reflection and transmission anomalies can arise in both of these scenarios.",

Competitive threshold-linear networks have long been known to exhibit multistability, where the activity of the network settles into one of potentially many steady states. In this work, we find conditions that guarantee the absence of steady states, while maintaining bounded activity. These conditions lead us to define a combinatorial family of competitive threshold-linear networks, parametrized by a simple directed graph. By exploring this family, we discover that threshold-linear networks are capable of displaying a surprisingly rich variety of nonlinear dynamics, including limit cycles, quasi-periodic attractors, and chaos. In particular, several types of nonlinear behaviors can co-exist in the same network. Our mathematical results also enable us to engineer networks with multiple dynamic patterns. Taken together, these theoretical and computational findings suggest that threshold-linear networks may be a valuable tool for understanding the relationship between network connectivity and emergent dynamics.",

For fast-slow systems, truncated ODEs describe the fast dynamics. We define compatibility classes as subsets of the state space, obtained by equating the conservation laws to constants. A set of conservation laws is complete when the corresponding compatibility classes contain a finite number of steady states. Complete sets of conservation laws can be used for model order reduction and for studying the multistationarity of the model. We provide algorithmic methods for computing linear, monomial, and polynomial conservation laws of polynomial ODE models and for testing their completeness. The resulting conservation laws and their completeness are either independent or dependent on the parameters. In the latter case, we provide parametric case distinctions.

Since moment systems consist of a high or even infinite number of coupled equations, an indispensable step in obtaining a low-dimensional representation that is amenable to further analysis is, in many cases, to select a moment closure. A moment closure consists of a set of approximations that express certain higher-order moments in terms of lower-order ones, so that applying those leads to a closed system of equations for only the lower-order moments. Closures are frequently found drawing on intuition and heuristics to come up with quantitatively good approximations. In contrast to that, we propose an alternative approach where we instead focus on closures giving rise to certain qualitative features, such as bifurcations. Importantly, this fundamental change of perspective provides one with the possibility of classifying moment closures rigorously in regard to these features. This makes the design and selection of closures more algorithmic, precise, and reliable. In this work, we carefully study the moment systems that arise in the mean-field descriptions of two widely known network dynamical systems, the SIS epidemic and the adaptive voter model. We derive conditions that any moment closure has to satisfy so that the corresponding closed systems exhibit the transcritical bifurcation that one expects in these systems coming from the stochastic particle model.",

The Kuramoto model is a classical mathematical model in the field of nonlinear dynamical systems that describes the evolution of coupled oscillators in a network that may reach a synchronous state. The relationship between the network’s topology and whether the oscillators synchronize is a central question in the field of synchronization, and random graphs are often employed as a proxy for complex networks. On the other hand, the random graphs on which the Kuramoto model is rigorously analyzed in the literature are homogeneous models and fail to capture the underlying geometric structure that appears in several examples. In this work, we leverage tools from random matrix theory, random graphs, and mathematical statistics to prove that the Kuramoto model on a random geometric graph on the sphere synchronizes with probability tending to one as the number of nodes tends to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous result for the Kuramoto model on random geometric graphs.",

A weakly nonlinear stability analysis of isothermal Poiseuille flow in a fluid overlying porous domain is proposed and investigated in this article. The nonlinear interactions are studied by imposing finite amplitude disturbances to the classical model deliberated in Chang, Chen, and Straughan [J. Fluid Mech., 564 (2006), pp. 287–303]. The order parameter theory is used to ascertain the cubic Landau equation, and the regimes of instability for the bifurcations are determined henceforth. The well-established controlling parameters viz. the depth ratio [math] depth of fluid domain/depth of porous domain), the Beavers–Joseph constant [math], and the Darcy number [math] are inquired upon for the bifurcation phenomena. The imposed finite amplitude disturbances are viewed for bifurcations along the neutral stability curves and away from the critical point as a function of the wave number [math] and the Reynolds number [math]. The even-fluid-layer (porous) mode along the neutral stability curves correlates to the subcritical (supercritical) bifurcation phenomena. On perceiving the bifurcations as a function of [math] and [math] by moving away from the bifurcation/critical point, subcritical bifurcation is observed for increasing [math] and decreasing [math]. In contrast to only fluid flow through a channel, it is found that the inclusion of porous domain aids in the early appearance of subcritical bifurcation when [math].

The Wigner quasi-density function allows a phase-space formulation of statistical quantum mechanics that is of fundamental importance in theoretical investigation and in applications. This work contributes to these tasks with the formulation and analysis of an optimal control problem for the Wigner equation, which describes the time evolution of the quasi-density function. For this purpose, two possible control mechanisms are considered, and, correspondingly, a detailed analysis in weighted Sobolev spaces for the controlled nonhomogeneous Wigner equation is presented. Further theoretical results are reported concerning existence of optimal controls and differentiability of the control-to-state map and of the ensemble cost functional, which allows the derivation of the optimality system that characterizes the optimal controls sought.",

A lubrication model can be used to describe the dynamics of a weakly volatile viscous fluid layer on a hydrophobic substrate. Thin layers of the fluid are unstable to perturbations and break up into slowly evolving interacting droplets. A reduced-order dynamical system is derived from the lubrication model based on the nearest-neighbor droplet interactions in the weak condensation limit. Dynamics for periodic arrays of identical drops and pairwise droplet interactions are investigated, providing insights into the coarsening dynamics of a large droplet system. Weak condensation is shown to be a singular perturbation, fundamentally changing the long-time coarsening dynamics for the droplets and the overall mass of the fluid in two additional regimes of long-time dynamics.",

In this paper, a study is carried out on the spatiotemporal dynamics of a Lengyel–Epstein model describing the chlorite-iodine-malonic-acid (CIMA) reaction with time delay and the Neumann boundary condition in a two-dimensional region. The existences for Turing, Hopf, Turing–Turing, Turing–Hopf, and Bogdanov–Takens bifurcations are derived by analyzing the dispersion relation between eigenvalues and wave numbers. In particular, to study the dynamics around a Turing–Hopf bifurcation singularity, the amplitude equations near a codimension-two bifurcation point are derived by employing the weakly nonlinear analysis method. Different spatiotemporal patterns for the system in parameter space are classified and various patterns identified, including spatially homogeneous periodic solutions, mixed mode, coexistence mode, bistable phenomenon, square, hexagon, black eye, two-phase oscillating staggered hexagon lattice, and other complex spatiotemporal patterns. The theoretical predictions are verified by numerical simulations showing an excellent agreement with many reported experiment results not only in chemistry but also in physics and biology. Results presented in this article reveal the mechanism of generating the spatiotemporal patterns of the CIMA reaction.",

A method for computing the Riesz [math]-capacity, [math], of a general set [math] is given. The method is based on simulations of isotropic [math]-stable motion paths in [math]-dimensions. The familiar walk-on-spheres method, often utilized for simulating Brownian motion, is modified to a novel walk-in-and-out-of-balls method adapted for modeling the stable path process on the exterior of regions “probed” by this type of generalized random walk. It accounts for the propensity of this class of random walk to jump through boundaries because of the path discontinuity. This method allows for the computationally efficient simulation of hitting locations of stable paths launched from the exterior of probed sets. Reliable methods of computing capacity from these locations are given, along with non-standard confidence intervals. Illustrative calculations are performed for representative types of sets [math], where both [math] and [math] are varied.",

We define and study reachability preservers, a graph-theoretic primitive that has been implicit in prior work on network design. Given a directed graph [math] and a set of demand pairs [math], a reachability preserver is a sparse subgraph [math] that preserves reachability between all demand pairs Our first contribution is a series of extremal bounds on the size of reachability preservers. Our main result states that, for an [math]-node graph and demand pairs of the form [math] for a small node subset [math], there is always a reachability preserver on [math] edges. We additionally give a lower bound construction demonstrating that this upper bound characterizes the settings in which [math] size reachability preservers are generally possible, in a large range of parameters. The second contribution of this paper is a new connection between extremal graph sparsification results and classical Steiner Network Design problems. Surprisingly, prior to this work, the osmosis of techniques between these two fields had been superficial. This allows us to improve the state of the art approximation algorithms for the most basic Steiner-type problem in directed graphs from the [math] of Chlamtáč et al. [Approximating spanners and directed steiner forest: Upper and lower bounds, in Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, SIAM, Philadelphia, 2017, pp. 534–553] to [math].",

We study the problem of approximating the distances in an undirected weighted graph [math] by the distances in trees based on the notion of stretch. Focusing on decentralized models of computation such as the [math], [math], and semi-streaming models, our main results are as follows: (1) We develop a simple randomized algorithm that constructs a spanning tree such that the expected stretch of every edge is [math], where [math] is the number of nodes in [math].

The Kneser graph [math] is defined for integers [math] and [math] with [math] as the graph whose vertices are all the [math]-subsets of [math] where two such sets are adjacent if they are disjoint. The Schrijver graph [math] is defined as the subgraph of [math] induced by the collection of all [math]-subsets of [math] that do not include two consecutive elements modulo [math]. It is known that the chromatic number of both [math] and [math] is [math]. In the computational Kneser and Schrijver problems, we are given access to a coloring with [math] colors of the vertices of [math] and [math], respectively, and the goal is to find a monochromatic edge. We prove that the problems admit randomized algorithms with running time [math], hence they are fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the parameter [math]. The analysis involves structural results on intersecting families and on induced subgraphs of Kneser and Schrijver graphs. We also study the Agreeable-Set problem of assigning a small subset of a set of [math] items to a group of [math] agents, so that all agents value the subset at least as much as its complement. As an application of our algorithm for the Kneser problem, we obtain a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for the Agreeable-Set problem for instances with [math]. We further show that the Agreeable-Set problem is at least as hard as a variant of the Kneser problem with extended access to the input coloring.",

We study the computational complexity of the problem [math] of counting [math]-vertex induced subgraphs of a graph [math] that satisfy a graph property [math]. Our main result establishes an exhaustive and explicit classification for all hereditary properties, including tight conditional lower bounds under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH): If a hereditary property [math] is true for all graphs, or if it is true only for finitely many graphs, then [math] is solvable in polynomial time. Otherwise, [math] is [math]-complete when parameterized by [math], and, assuming ETH, it cannot be solved in time [math] for any function [math]. This classification features a wide range of properties for which the corresponding detection problem (as classified by Khot and Raman [Theoret. Comput. Sci., 289 (2002), pp. 997–1008]) is tractable but counting is hard. Moreover, even for properties which are already intractable in their decision version, our results yield significantly stronger lower bounds for the counting problem. As an additional result, we also present an exhaustive and explicit parameterized complexity classification for all properties that are invariant under homomorphic equivalence. By covering one of the most natural and general notions of closure, namely, closure under vertex-deletion (hereditary), we generalize some of the earlier results on this problem. For instance, our results fully subsume and strengthen the existing classification of [math] for monotone (subgraph-closed) properties due to Roth, Schmitt, and Wellnitz [SIAM J. Comput., (2022), pp. FOCS20-139–FOCS20-174].",
