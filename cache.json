In this first part, we will introduce a simple interpolation method named Spherical Interpolation of orDER n (SIDER-n) that gives a \n                      \n                      \\(C^{n}\\)\n                      \n                     interpolant given \n                      \n                      \\(n \\ge 2\\)\n                      \n                    . The idea generalizes the construction of the Bézier curves developed for \n                      \n                      \\(\\mathbb {R}\\)\n                      \n                    . The second part incorporates the ENO philosophy and develops a new Spherical Essentially Non-Oscillatory (SENO) interpolation method. When the underlying curve on \n                      \n                      \\(\\mathbb {S}^2\\)\n                      \n                     has kinks or sharp discontinuity in the higher derivatives, our proposed approach can reduce spurious oscillations in the high-order reconstruction.

In particular, we establish a series of new quadrature rules for this transform and carry out rigorous analysis, including the cases that the oscillator g(x) has either zeros or stationary points. The error analysis shows the advantages that this approach exhibits high asymptotic order, and the accuracy improves significantly as either the frequency \n                      \n                      \\(\\omega \\)\n                      \n                     or the number of nodes n increases.

In the latter case, we take advantage of the natural adjoint-like properties of generative models and the ability to simulate forwards and backwards in time. GANs have received much attention recently, after achieving excellent results for their generation of realistic-looking images. We wish to explore how this property translates to new applications in computational modelling and to exploit the adjoint-like properties for efficient data assimilation. We apply these methods to a compartmental model in epidemiology that is able to model space and time variations, and that mimics the spread of COVID-19 in an idealised town. To do this, the GAN is set within a reduced-order model, which uses a low-dimensional space for the spatial distribution of the simulation states. Then the GAN learns the evolution of the low-dimensional states over time. The results show that the proposed methods can accurately predict the evolution of the high-fidelity numerical simulation, and can efficiently assimilate observed data and determine the corresponding model parameters.",

          "description": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we present a pressure-based semi-implicit numerical scheme for a first order hyperbolic formulation of compressible two-phase flow with surface tension and viscosity. The numerical method addresses several complexities presented by the PDE system in consideration: (i) The presence of involution constraints of curl type in the governing equations requires explicit enforcement of the zero-curl property of certain vector fields (an interface field and a distortion field); the problem is solved by adopting a set of compatible discrete curl and gradient operators on a staggered grid, allowing to preserve the Schwarz identity of cross-derivatives exactly at the discrete level. (ii) Since the complexity of the studied PDE system does not allow the explicit computation of its exact eigenvalues, reliable and precise analytical estimates are provided. (iii) The evolution equations feature highly nonlinear stiff algebraic source terms which are used for the description of viscous interactions as emergent behaviour of an elasto-plastic solid in the stiff strain relaxation limit; such source terms are reliably integrated with a novel and very efficient semi-analytical technique proposed for the first time in this paper. (iv) In the low-Mach number regime, standard explicit density-based Godunov-type schemes lose efficiency and accuracy; the issue is addressed by means of a simple semi-implicit, pressure-based, split treatment of acoustic and non-acoustic waves, again using staggered grids that recover the implicit solution for a single scalar field (the pressure) through a sequence of symmetric-positive definite linear systems that can be efficiently solved via the conjugate gradient method.",

However, when dealing with large-scale machine learning issues, the computation of the full gradient of the differentiable term can be prohibitively expensive by making these algorithms unsuitable.

          "description": "Abstract\nA posteriori upper and lower bounds are derived for the linear finite element method (FEM) for the Helmholtz equation with large wavenumber. It is proved rigorously that the standard residual type error estimator seriously underestimates the true error of the FE solution for the mesh size h in the preasymptotic regime, which is first observed by Babuška et al. (Int J Numer Methods Eng 40:3443–3462, 1997) for a one dimensional problem. By establishing an equivalence relationship between the error estimators for the FE solution and the corresponding elliptic projection of the exact solution, an adaptive algorithm is proposed and its convergence and quasi-optimality are proved under the condition that \n                      \n                      \\(k^3h_0^{1+\\alpha }\\)\n                      \n                     is sufficiently small, where k is the wavenumber, \n                      \n                      \\(h_0\\)\n                      \n                     is the initial mesh size, and \n                      \n                      \\(\\frac{1}{2}<\\alpha \\le 1\\)\n                      \n                     is a regularity constant depending on the maximum reentrant angle of the domain. Numerical tests are given to verify the theoretical findings and to show that the adaptive continuous interior penalty finite element method (CIP-FEM) with appropriately selected penalty parameters can greatly reduce the pollution error and hence the residual type error estimator for this CIP-FEM is reliable and efficient even in the preasymptotic regime.",

Load balancing is a well-studied problem, with balls-in-bins being the primary framework. The greedy algorithm [math] of Azar et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 29 (1999), pp. 180–200] places each ball by probing [math] random bins and placing the ball in the least loaded of them. With high probability, the maximum load under [math] is exponentially lower than the result when balls are placed uniformly randomly. Vöcking [J. ACM, 50 (2003), pp. 568–589] showed that a slightly asymmetric variant, [math], provides a further significant improvement. However, this improvement comes at the additional computational cost of imposing structure on the bins. Here, we present a fully decentralized and easy-to-implement algorithm called [math] that combines the simplicity of [math] and the improved balance of [math]. The key idea in [math] is to probe until a different bin size from the first observation is located and then place the ball. Although the number of probes could be quite large for some of the balls, we show that [math] requires only at most [math] probes on average per ball (in both the standard and the heavily loaded settings). Thus the number of probes is no greater than that of either [math] or [math]. More importantly, we show that [math] closely matches the improved maximum load ensured by [math] in both the standard and heavily loaded settings. We further provide a tight lower bound on the maximum load up to [math] terms. We additionally give experimental data that [math] is indeed as good as [math], if not better, in practice.",

Given a planar graph [math] and an integer [math], it is possible in polynomial time to randomly sample a subset [math] of vertices of [math] with the following properties: [math] induces a subgraph of [math] of treewidth [math], and for every connected subgraph [math] of [math] on at most [math] vertices, the probability that [math] covers the whole vertex set of [math] is at least [math], where [math] is the number of vertices of [math]. Together with standard dynamic programming techniques for graphs of bounded treewidth, this result gives a versatile technique for obtaining (randomized) subexponential-time parameterized algorithms for problems on planar graphs, usually with running time bound [math]. The technique can be applied to problems expressible as searching for a small, connected pattern with a prescribed property in a large host graph; examples of such problems include Directed [math]-Path, Weighted [math]-Path, Vertex Cover Local Search, and Subgraph Isomorphism, among others. Up to this point, it was open whether these problems could be solved in subexponential parameterized time on planar graphs, because they are not amenable to the classic technique of bidimensionality. Furthermore, all our results hold in fact on any class of graphs that exclude a fixed apex graph as a minor, in particular on graphs embeddable in any fixed surface.",

Graph sparsification underlies a large number of algorithms, ranging from approximation algorithms for cut problems to solvers for linear systems in the graph Laplacian. In its strongest form, “spectral sparsification” reduces the number of edges to near-linear in the number of nodes, while approximately preserving the cut and spectral structure of the graph. In this work we demonstrate a polynomial quantum speedup for spectral sparsification and many of its applications. In particular, we give a quantum algorithm that, given a weighted graph with [math] nodes and [math] edges, outputs a classical description of an [math]-spectral sparsifier in sublinear time [math]. This contrasts with the optimal classical complexity [math]. We also prove that our quantum algorithm is optimal up to polylog-factors. The algorithm builds on a string of existing results on sparsification, graph spanners, quantum algorithms for shortest paths, and efficient constructions for [math]-wise independent random strings. Our algorithm implies a quantum speedup for solving Laplacian systems and for approximating a range of cut problems such as min cut and sparsest cut.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 51, Issue 6, Page 1796-1838, December 2022. \n Abstract. We present a general framework for designing approximately revenue-optimal mechanisms for multi-item additive auctions, which applies to both truthful and nontruthful auctions. Given a (not necessarily truthful) single-item auction format [math] satisfying certain technical conditions, we run simultaneous item auctions augmented with a personalized entry fee for each bidder that must be paid before the auction can be accessed. These entry fees depend only on the prior distribution of bidder types and in particular are independent of realized bids. We bound the revenue of the resulting two-part tariff mechanism using a novel geometric technique that enables revenue guarantees for many common nontruthful auctions that previously had none. Our approach adapts and extends the duality framework of Cai, Devanur, and Weinberg [SIAM J. Comput., 50 (2021), pp. STOC16-160–STOC16-200] beyond truthful auctions. Our framework can be used with many common auction formats, such as simultaneous first-price, simultaneous second-price, and simultaneous all-pay auctions. Our results for first-price and all-pay are the first revenue guarantees of nontruthful mechanisms in multidimensional environments, addressing an open question in the literature [T. Roughgarden, V. Syrgkanis, and E. Tardos, J. Artificial Intelligence Res., 59 (2017), pp. 59–101]. If all-pay auctions are used, we prove that the resulting mechanism is also credible in the sense that the auctioneer cannot benefit by deviating from the stated mechanism after observing agent bids. This is the first static credible mechanism for multi-item additive auctions that achieves a constant factor of the optimal revenue. If second-price auctions are used, we obtain a truthful [math]-approximate mechanism with fixed entry fees that are amenable to tuning via online learning techniques.",
