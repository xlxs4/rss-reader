The time-fractional term is discretized using the well-known non-uniform L1-method, as the integer-order temporal derivatives of the solution blow up at the initial point. For the spatial discretization, a dimensional-splitting weak Galerkin finite element method is used in both x and y directions over a uniform mesh. The stability and the optimal error estimate of the proposed scheme are addressed in the \n                      \n                      \\(L^2\\)\n                      \n                    -norm.

          "description": "Abstract\nThe growing availability and usage of low precision floating point formats attracts many interests of developing lower or mixed precision algorithms for scientific computing problems. In this paper we investigate the possibility of exploiting mixed precision computing in LSQR for solving discrete linear ill-posed problems. Based on the commonly used regularization model for linear inverse problems, we analyze the choice of proper computing precision in the two main parts of LSQR, including the construction of Krylov subspace and updating procedure of iterative solutions. We show that, under some mild conditions, the Lanczos vectors can be computed using single precision without loss of any accuracy of the final regularized solution as long as the noise level is not extremely small. We also show that the most time consuming part for updating iterative solutions can be performed using single precision without sacrificing any accuracy. The results indicate that several highly time consuming parts of the algorithm can be implemented using lower precisions, and provide a theoretical guideline for implementing a robust and efficient mixed precision variant of LSQR for solving discrete linear ill-posed problems. Numerical experiments are made to test two mixed precision variants of LSQR and confirming our results.",

Different from the existing multigrid methods for multilevel block Toeplitz systems, we aggregate a given multilevel block Toeplitz matrix to a new multilevel Toeplitz matrix in such a way that a very sparse coarse grid matrix is constructed in practice. Then, we give an asymptotically tight bound of the convergence rate and provide an algorithm for selecting the optimal prolongation vector and the relaxation factor for our method. Numerical experiments on artificial examples are provided for visualizing the correctness of our analysis, while experiments associated with practical examples show the efficiency of our method in terms of computing time.",

At every cell interface we approximate the solution by a polynomial in time. This allows to evolve the point values using characteristics and to update the cell averages using fluxes obtained by integrating this polynomial.

The formulation of the time–dependent poroelasticity equations uses displacement, fluid pressure and total pressure, and the elasticity equations are written in displacement-pressure formulation. The construction of the virtual element scheme does not require Lagrange multipliers to impose the transmission conditions (continuity of displacement and total traction, and no-flux for the fluid) on the interface. We show the stability and convergence of the virtual element method for different polynomial degrees, and the error bounds are robust with respect to delicate model parameters (such as Lamé constants, permeability, and storativity coefficient). Finally we provide some simple numerical examples that illustrate the properties of the scheme.",

          "description": "Multiscale Modeling & Simulation, Volume 22, Issue 1, Page 230-255, March 2024. \n Abstract. Sea ice profoundly influences the polar environment and the global climate. Traditionally, sea ice has been modeled as a continuum under Eulerian coordinates to describe its large-scale features, using, for instance, viscous-plastic rheology. Recently, Lagrangian particle models, also known as the discrete element method models, have been utilized for characterizing the motion of individual sea ice fragments (called floes) at scales of 10 km and smaller, especially in marginal ice zones. This paper develops a multiscale model that couples the particle and the continuum systems to facilitate an effective representation of the dynamical and statistical features of sea ice across different scales. The multiscale model exploits a Boltzmann-type system that links the particle movement with the continuum equations. For the small-scale dynamics, it describes the motion of each sea ice floe. Then, as the large-scale continuum component, it treats the statistical moments of mass density and linear and angular velocities. The evolution of these statistics affects the motion of individual floes, which in turn provides bulk feedback that adjusts the large-scale dynamics. Notably, the particle model characterizing the sea ice floes is localized and fully parallelized in a framework that is sometimes called superparameterization, which significantly improves computational efficiency. Numerical examples demonstrate the effective performance of the multiscale model. Additionally, the study demonstrates that the multiscale model has a linear-order approximation to the truth model.",

Traditional sensitivity analysis methods fail for chaotic systems due to the unstable characteristics of the linearized equations. To overcome these issues two methods have been developed in the literature, one being the shadowing approach, which results in a minimization problem, and the other being numerical viscosity, where a damping term is added to the linearized equations to suppress the instability. The shadowing approach is computationally expensive but produces accurate sensitivities, while numerical viscosity can produce less accurate sensitivities but with significantly reduced computational cost. However, it is not fully clear how the solutions generated by these two approaches compare to each other. In this work we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a control term, found with optimal control theory techniques, to prevent the exponential growth of solution of the linearized equations. We will refer to this method as optimal control shadowing. We investigate the computational aspects and performance of this new method on the Lorenz and Kuramoto–Sivashinsky systems and compare its performance with simple numerical viscosity schemes. We show that the tangent solution generated by the proposed approach is similar to that generated by shadowing methods, suggesting that optimal control attempts to stabilize the unstable shadowing direction. Further, for the spatially extended system, we examine the energy budget of the tangent equation and show that the control term found via the solution of the optimal control problem acts only at length scales where production of tangent energy dominates dissipation, which is not necessarily the case for the numerical viscosity methods.",

We propose a general strategy for reduced order modeling of systems that display highly nonlinear oscillations. By considering a continuous family of forced periodic orbits defined in relation to a stable fixed point and subsequently leveraging phase-amplitude-based reduction strategies, we arrive at a low order model capable of accurately capturing nonlinear oscillations resulting from arbitrary external inputs. In the limit that oscillations are small, the system dynamics relax to those obtained from local linearization, i.e., that can be fully described using linear eigenmodes. For larger amplitude oscillations, the behavior can be understood in terms of the dynamics of a small number of nonlinear modes. We illustrate the proposed strategy in a variety of examples yielding results that are substantially better than those obtained using standard linearization-based techniques.",

The dynamics of the surrogate model is interrogated using combinatorial methods and characterized using algebraic topological invariants (Conley index). The GP predictive distribution provides a lower bound on the confidence that these topological invariants, and hence the characterized dynamics, apply to the unknown dynamical system (assumed to be a sample path of the GP).

This paper is mainly concerned with limiting behaviors of invariant measures for neural field lattice models in a random environment. First of all, we consider the convergence relation of invariant measures between the stochastic neural field lattice model and the corresponding deterministic model in weighted spaces, and prove any limit of a sequence of invariant measures of such a lattice model must be an invariant measure of its limiting system as the noise intensity tends to zero. Then we are devoted to studying the numerical approximation of invariant measures of such a stochastic neural lattice model. To this end, we first consider convergence of invariant measures between such a neural lattice model and the system with neurons only interacting with its n-neighborhood; then we further prove the convergence relation of invariant measures between the system with an n-neighborhood and its finite dimensional truncated system. By this procedure, the invariant measure of the stochastic neural lattice models can be approximated by the numerical invariant measure of a finite dimensional truncated system based on the backward Euler–Maruyama (BEM) scheme. Therefore, the invariant measure of a deterministic neural field lattice model can be observed by the invariant measure of the BEM scheme when the noise is not negligible.",

Generalized mass-action systems are power-law dynamical systems arising from chemical reaction networks. Essentially, every nonnegative ODE model used in chemistry and biology (for example, in ecology and epidemiology) and even in economics and engineering can be written in this form. Previous results have focused on existence and uniqueness of special steady states (complex-balanced equilibria) for all rate constants, thereby ruling out multiple (special) steady states. Recently, necessary conditions for linear stability have been obtained. In this work, we provide sufficient conditions for the linear stability of complex-balanced equilibria for all rate constants (and also for the nonexistence of other steady states). In particular, via sign vector conditions (on the stoichiometric coefficients and kinetic orders), we guarantee that the Jacobian matrix is a [math]-matrix. Technically, we use a new decomposition of the graph Laplacian which allows us to consider orders of (generalized) monomials. Alternatively, we use cycle decomposition which allows a linear parametrization of all Jacobian matrices. In any case, we guarantee stability without explicit computation of steady states. We illustrate our results in examples from chemistry and biology: generalized Lotka–Volterra systems and SIR models, a two-component signaling system, and an enzymatic futile cycle.",

Model reduction of fast-slow chemical reaction networks based on the quasi-steady state approximation fails when the fast subsystem has first integrals. We call these first integrals approximate conservation laws. In order to define fast subsystems and identify approximate conservation laws, we use ideas from tropical geometry. We prove that any approximate conservation law evolves more slowly than all the species involved in it and therefore represents a supplementary slow variable in an extended system. By elimination of some variables of the extended system, we obtain networks without approximate conservation laws, which can be reduced by standard singular perturbation methods. The field of applications of approximate conservation laws covers the quasi-equilibrium approximation, which is well known in biochemistry. We discuss reductions of slow-fast as well as multiple timescale systems. Networks with multiple timescales have hierarchical relaxation. At a given timescale, our multiple timescale reduction method defines three subsystems composed of (i) slaved fast variables satisfying algebraic equations, (ii) slow driving variables satisfying reduced ordinary differential equations, and (iii) quenched much slower variables that are constant. The algebraic equations satisfied by fast variables define chains of nested normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds. In such chains, faster manifolds are of higher dimension and contain the slower manifolds. Our reduction methods are introduced algorithmically for networks with monomial reaction rates and linear, monomial, or polynomial approximate conservation laws. We propose symbolic algorithms to reshape and rescale the networks such that geometric singular perturbation theory can be applied to them, test the applicability of the theory, and finally reduce the networks. As a proof of concept, we apply this method to a model of the TGF-beta signaling pathway.",

The mechanism of seed dispersal mutualism is fundamental to understanding vegetation diversity and its conservation. In this study, we propose a stochastic model that extends the classical framework of seed dispersal mutualism to explore the effects of environmental stochasticity on mutualistic interactions between seed dispersers and plants. We first provide a comprehensive picture of the long-term dynamics of seed dispersal mutualism in deterministic and stochastic environments. We then analyze the relationship between stochasticity and the probability and time that seed dispersal mutualism tips between stable states. Additionally, we evaluate the extinction risk of seed dispersal mutualism for different population values and accordingly assign extinction warning levels to these values. The analysis reveals that the impact of environmental stochasticity on tipping phenomena is scenario-dependent but follows some interpretable trends. The probability (resp., time) of tipping towards the extinction state typically increases (resp., decreases) monotonically with noise intensity, while the probability of tipping towards the coexistence state typically peaks at intermediate noise intensity. Noise in animal populations contributes to tipping toward the coexistence state, whereas noise in plant populations slows down the tipping toward the coexistence state. Noise-induced changes in warning levels of initial population values are most pronounced near the boundaries of the basin of attraction, but sufficiently loud noise (especially for plant populations) may alter the risk far from these boundaries. These findings provide a theoretical explanation for the effect of environmental stochasticity on multistability transitions in seed dispersal mutualism and can be utilized to study the interplay between other population systems and environmental stochasticity.",

Starting from a nonlocal version of the Prigogine–Herman traffic model, we derive a natural hierarchy of kinetic discrete-velocity models for traffic flow consisting of systems of quasi-linear hyperbolic equations with relaxation terms. The hyperbolic main part of these models turns out to have several favorable features. In particular, we determine Riemann invariants and prove richness and total linear degeneracy of the hyperbolic systems. Moreover, a physically reasonable invariant domain is obtained for all equations of the hierarchy. Additionally, we investigate the full relaxation system with respect to stability and persistence of periodic (stop-and-go-type) solutions and derive a condition for the appearance of such solutions. Finally, numerical results for various situations are presented, illustrating the analytical findings.",

Microbes are able to deploy different strategies in response to, and depending upon, local environmental conditions. In the setting of a microbial community, this property induces a Nash equilibrium problem because access to environmental resources is bounded. If microbes are also distributed in space, then those resources are subject to transport limitations (encoded in a PDE) and so microbial strategies at one location influence resources and, hence, microbial strategies, at another. Here we formulate the resulting PDE-coupled generalized Nash equilibrium problem for a multispecies biofilm community, and propose a domain-decomposition-based method for its solution. An example consisting of a model with two microbial species biofilm with 33 externally transported chemical concentrations is presented.",

This article presents a new method to reconstruct slowly varying width defects in two-dimensional waveguides using one-side section measurements at locally resonant frequencies. At these frequencies, locally resonant modes propagate in the waveguide up to a “cut-off” position. In this particular point, the local width of the waveguide can be recovered. Given multifrequency data measured on a section of the waveguide, we perform an efficient layer stripping approach to recover, section by section, the shape variations. It provides an L infinity-stable method to reconstruct the width of a slowly monotonous varying waveguide. We validate this method on numerical data and discuss its limits.",
