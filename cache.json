          "description": "Abstract\nIn this study, we present a second-order time-accurate unconditionally stable numerical method for a gradient flow for the Modica–Mortola functional with an equispaced multiple well potential. The proposed second-order time-accurate unconditionally stable numerical method is based on the operator splitting method. The nonlinear and linear terms in the gradient flow are solved analytically and using the Fourier spectral method, respectively. The numerical solutions in each step are bounded for any time step size and the overall scheme is temporally second-order accurate. We prove theoretically the unconditional stability and boundedness of the numerical solutions. In addition, several numerical tests are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.",

The approach is centered around the efficient solution of linear or nonlinear optimization problems in every timestep as a correction to the basic discontinuous Galerkin scheme. The thereby enforced Dafermos criterion results in improved stability compared to the basic method while retaining a high order of accuracy in numerical experiments for scalar conservation laws. Further modification of the optimization problem allows also to enforce classical entropy inequalities for the scheme. The proposed stabilization is therefore an alternative to flux-differencing to enforce entropy inequalities. As the shock-capturing abilities of the scheme are also enhanced is the method also an alternative to finite-volume subcells, artificial viscosity, modal filtering, and other shock capturing procedures in one space dimension. Tests are carried out for Burgers’ equation.",

This paper investigates the inverse source problem with a single propagating mode at multiple frequencies in an acoustic waveguide. The goal is to provide both theoretical justification and efficient algorithms for imaging extended sources using the sampling methods. In contrast to the existing far/near-field operator based on the integral over the space variable in the sampling methods, a multi-frequency far-field operator is introduced based on the integral over the frequency variable. This far-field operator is defined in a way to incorporate the possibly nonlinear dispersion relation, a unique feature in waveguides. The factorization method is deployed to establish a rigorous characterization of the range support, which is the support of source in the direction of wave propagation. A related factorization-based sampling method is also discussed. These sampling methods are shown to be capable of imaging the range support of the source. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the sampling methods, including an example to image a complete sound-soft block.",

Online learning algorithms, widely used to power search and content optimization on the web, must balance exploration and exploitation, potentially sacrificing the experience of current users in order to gain information that will lead to better decisions in the future. While necessary in the worst case, explicit exploration has a number of disadvantages compared to the greedy algorithm that always “exploits” by choosing an action that currently looks optimal. We determine under what conditions inherent diversity in the data makes explicit exploration unnecessary. We build on a recent line of work on the smoothed analysis of the greedy algorithm in the linear contextual bandits model. We improve on prior results to show that the greedy algorithm almost matches the best possible Bayesian regret rate of any other algorithm on the same problem instance whenever the diversity conditions hold. The key technical finding is that data collected by the greedy algorithm suffices to simulate a run of any other algorithm. Further, we prove that under a particular smoothness assumption, the Bayesian regret of the greedy algorithm is at most [math] in the worst case, where [math] is the time horizon.",

Isomanifolds are the generalization of isosurfaces to arbitrary dimension and codimension, i.e., submanifolds of [math] defined as the zero set of some multivariate multivalued smooth function [math], where [math] is the intrinsic dimension of the manifold. A natural way to approximate a smooth isomanifold [math] is to consider its piecewise linear (PL) approximation [math] based on a triangulation [math] of the ambient space [math]. In this paper, we describe a simple algorithm to trace isomanifolds from a given starting point. The algorithm works for arbitrary dimensions [math] and [math], and any precision [math]. Our main result is that, when [math] (or [math]) has bounded complexity, the complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in [math] and [math] (and unavoidably exponential in [math]). Since it is known that for [math], [math] is [math]-close and isotopic to [math], our algorithm produces a faithful PL-approximation of isomanifolds of bounded complexity in time polynomial in [math]. Combining this algorithm with dimensionality reduction techniques, the dependency on [math] in the size of [math] can be completely removed with high probability. We also show that the algorithm can handle isomanifolds with boundary and, more generally, isostratifolds. The algorithm for isomanifolds with boundary has been implemented and experimental results are reported, showing that it is practical and can handle cases that are far ahead of the state-of-the-art.",

More precisely, given a [math]-edge-connected graph [math] and a set of extra edges, the task is to find a minimum cardinality subset of extra edges whose addition to [math] makes the graph [math]-edge-connected. If [math] is odd, the problem is known to reduce to the tree augmentation problem (TAP)—i.e., [math] is a spanning tree—for which significant progress has been achieved recently, leading to approximation factors below 1.5 (the current best factor is 1.458).

In the [math]-Consensus-Halving problem, a fundamental problem in fair division, there are [math] agents with valuations over the interval [0,1], and the goal is to divide the interval into pieces and assign a label “[math]” or “[math]” to each piece, such that every agent values the total amount of “[math]” and the total amount of “[math]” almost equally. The problem was recently proven by Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg [Proceedings of the 50th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2018, pp. 51–64; Proceedings of the 51st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2019, pp. 638–649] to be the first “natural” complete problem for the computational class PPA, answering a decade-old open question. In this paper, we examine the extent to which the problem becomes easy to solve if one restricts the class of valuation functions. To this end, we provide the following contributions. First, we obtain a strengthening of the PPA-hardness result of Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg [Proceedings of the 51st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2019, pp. 638–649] to the case when agents have piecewise uniform valuations with only two blocks. We obtain this result via a new reduction, which is in fact conceptually much simpler than the corresponding one in Filos-Ratsikas and Goldberg [Proceedings of the 51st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2019, pp. 638–649]. Then, we consider the case of single-block (uniform) valuations and provide a parameterized polynomial-time algorithm for solving [math]-Consensus-Halving for any [math], as well as a polynomial-time algorithm for [math]. Finally, an important application of our new techniques is the first hardness result for a generalization of Consensus-Halving, the Consensus-[math]-Division problem [F. W. Simmons and F. E. Su, Math. Social Sci., 45 (2003), pp. 15–25]. In particular, we prove that [math]-Consensus-[math]-Division is PPAD-hard.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. A tensor network is a diagram that specifies a way to “multiply” a collection of tensors together to produce another tensor (or matrix). Many existing algorithms for tensor problems (such as tensor decomposition and tensor PCA), although they are not presented this way, can be viewed as spectral methods on matrices built from simple tensor networks. In this work we leverage the full power of this abstraction to design new algorithms for certain continuous tensor decomposition problems. An important and challenging family of tensor problems comes from orbit recovery, a class of inference problems involving group actions (inspired by applications such as cryo-electron microscopy). Orbit recovery problems over finite groups can often be solved via standard tensor methods. However, for infinite groups, no general algorithms are known. We give a new spectral algorithm based on tensor networks for one such problem: continuous multi-reference alignment over the infinite group SO(2). Our algorithm extends to the more general heterogeneous case.",

          "description": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Ahead of Print. \n Abstract. We introduce a new technique for proving membership of problems in FIXP: the class capturing the complexity of computing a fixed point of an algebraic circuit. Our technique constructs a “pseudogate,” which can be used as a black box when building FIXP circuits. This pseudogate, which we term the “OPT-gate,” can solve most convex optimization problems. Using the OPT-gate, we prove new FIXP-membership results, and we generalize and simplify several known results from the literature on fair division, game theory, and competitive markets. In particular, we prove complexity results for two classic problems: Computing a market equilibrium in the Arrow–Debreu model with general concave utilities is in FIXP, and computing an envy-free division of a cake with very general valuations is FIXP-complete. We further showcase the wide applicability of our technique by using it to obtain simplified proofs and extensions of known FIXP-membership results for equilibrium computation for various types of strategic games as well as the pseudomarket mechanism of Hylland and Zeckhauser.",
