 Abstract. We consider random wave coupling along a flat boundary in dimension three, where the coupling is between surface and body modes and is induced by scattering by a randomly heterogeneous medium. In an appropriate scaling regime we obtain a system of radiative transfer equations which are satisfied by the mean Wigner transform of the mode amplitudes. We provide a rigorous probabilistic framework for describing solutions to this system using that it has the form of a Kolmogorov equation for some Markov process. We then prove statistical stability of the smoothed Wigner transform under the Gaussian approximation. We conclude with analyzing the nonlinear inverse problem for the radiative transfer equations and establish the unique recovery of phase and group velocities as well as power spectral information for the medium fluctuations from the observed smoothed Wigner transform. The mentioned statistical stability is essential in monitoring applications where the realization of the random medium may change.</span>

 Abstract. Two competing types of interactions often play an important part in shaping system behavior, such as activatory and inhibitory functions in biological systems. Hence, signed networks, where each connection can be either positive or negative, have become popular models over recent years. However, the primary focus of the literature is on the unweighted and structurally balanced ones, where all cycles have an even number of negative edges. Hence here, we first introduce a classification of signed networks into balanced, antibalanced, or strictly unbalanced ones, and then characterize each type of signed networks in terms of the spectral properties of the signed weighted adjacency matrix. In particular, we show that the spectral radius of the matrix with signs is smaller than that without if and only if the signed network is strictly unbalanced. These properties are important to understand the dynamics on signed networks, both linear and nonlinear ones. Specifically, we find consistent patterns in a linear and a nonlinear dynamics theoretically, depending on their type of balance. We also propose two measures to further characterize strictly unbalanced networks, motivated by perturbation theory. Finally, we numerically verify these properties through experiments on both synthetic and real networks.</span>

 Abstract. This paper presents a methodology for the computation of whole sets of heteroclinic connections between isoenergetic slices of center manifolds of center [math] center [math] saddle fixed points of autonomous Hamiltonian systems. It involves (a) computing Taylor expansions of the center-unstable and center-stable manifolds of the departing and arriving fixed points through the parameterization method, using a new style that uncouples the center part from the hyperbolic one, thus making the fibered structure of the manifolds explicit; (b) uniformly meshing isoenergetic slices of the center manifolds, using a novel strategy that avoids numerical integration of the reduced differential equations and makes an explicit three-dimensional representation of these slices as deformed solid ellipsoids; (c) matching the center-stable and center-unstable manifolds of the departing and arriving points in a Poincaré section. The methodology is applied to obtain the whole set of isoenergetic heteroclinic connections from the center manifold of [math] to the center manifold of [math] in the Earth-Moon circular, spatial restricted three-body problem, for nine increasing energy levels that reach the appearance of halo orbits in both [math] and [math]. Some comments are made on possible applications to space mission design.</span>

 Abstract. Connection matrices are a generalization of Morse boundary operators from the classical Morse theory for gradient vector fields. Developing an efficient computational framework for connection matrices is particularly important in the context of a rapidly growing data science that requires new mathematical tools for discrete data. Toward this goal, the classical theory for connection matrices has been adapted to combinatorial frameworks that facilitate computation. We develop an efficient persistence-like algorithm to compute a connection matrix from a given combinatorial (multi) vector field on a simplicial complex. This algorithm requires a single pass, improving upon a known algorithm that runs an implicit recursion executing two passes at each level. Overall, the new algorithm is more simple, direct, and efficient than the state-of-the-art. Because of the algorithm’s similarity to the persistence algorithm, one may take advantage of various software optimizations from topological data analysis.</span>

In this work, we present an alternative formulation of the higher eigenvalue problem associated to the infinity Laplacian, which opens the door for numerical approximation of eigenfunctions. A rigorous analysis is performed to show the equivalence of the new formulation to the traditional one. Subsequently, we present consistent monotone schemes to approximate infinity ground states and higher eigenfunctions on grids. We prove that our method converges (up to a subsequence) to a viscosity solution of the eigenvalue problem, and perform numerical experiments which investigate theoretical conjectures and compute eigenfunctions on a variety of different domains.</span>

We describe novel numerical methods for solving a class of high-order time-dependent PDEs on general geometries, which involve second-order derivatives in time and up-to fourth-order derivatives in space. This type of PDEs are widely used in applications such as the Boussinesq equation and in modeling thin-walled elastic structures such as beams, plates and shells, etc. High-order spatial derivatives together with general geometries bring a number of challenges for many numerical methods. In this paper, we resolve these challenges by discretizing the spatial derivatives in domains with general geometries using the composite overlapping grid method. The discretization on overlapping grids requires numerical interpolations to couple solutions on different component grids. However, the presence of interpolation equations breaks the symmetry of the overall spatial discretization, causing numerical instability in time-stepping schemes. To address this, a fourth-order hyper-dissipation term is included for stabilization. Investigation of incorporating the hyper-dissipation term into several time-stepping schemes for solving the semi-discrete system leads to the development of a series of algorithms. Accurate and stable numerical boundary conditions for Dirichlet and Neumann type boundaries are also developed for general geometries. Quadratic eigenvalue problems for a simplified model problem on 1D overlapping grids are considered to reveal the weak instability caused by interpolation between component grids. This model problem is also investigated for the stabilization effects of the proposed algorithms. Carefully designed numerical experiments and two benchmark problems concerning the Kirchhoff–Love plate model are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our approaches. This work shows that finite difference methods on overlapping grids are well-suited for solving high-order PDEs in complex domains for realistic applications.</span>

 Abstract. In this work we study time-domain sound-soft scattering by small circles. Our goal is to derive an asymptotic model for this problem that is valid when the size of the particles tends to zero. We present a systematic approach to constructing such models based on a well-chosen Galerkin discretization of a boundary integral equation. The convergence of the method is achieved by decreasing the asymptotic parameter rather than increasing the number of basis functions. We prove the second-order convergence of the field error with respect to the particle size. Our findings are illustrated with numerical experiments.</span>

 Abstract. In this paper, we analyze the celebrated Haken–Kelso–Bunz model, describing the dynamics of bimanual coordination, in the presence of delay. We study the linear dynamics, stability, nonlinear behavior, and bifurcations of this model by both theoretical and numerical analysis. We calculate in-phase and antiphase limit cycles as well as quasi-periodic solutions via double Hopf bifurcation analysis and center manifold reduction. Moreover, we uncover further details on the global dynamic behavior by numerical continuation, including the occurrence of limit cycles in phase quadrature and 1-1 locking of quasi-periodic solutions.</span>

 Abstract. Contact defects are time-periodic patterns in one space dimension that resemble spatially homogeneous oscillations with a defect embedded in their core region. For theoretical and numerical purposes, it is important to understand whether these defects persist when the domain is truncated to large spatial intervals, supplemented by appropriate boundary conditions. The present work shows that truncated contact defects exist and are unique on sufficiently large spatial intervals.</span>

The HLLC approximate Riemann solver improves upon the HLL Riemann solver by resolving contact discontinuities. This is a particularly desirable property for multi-material codes in which problems usually contain material interfaces. However, the HLLC solver is known to suffer from the carbuncle phenomenon, a numerical instability most apparent at grid-aligned shocks in multi-dimensional simulations. Many problems of interest, including high energy-density physics applications, require the accurate resolution of both material interfaces and hydrodynamic shocks. A variety of methods have been developed to cure this instability, with varying degrees of complexity. The objective of this work is to describe a simple approach to modify the HLLC Riemann solver and prevent the carbuncle instability. The method is then demonstrated for assorted two-dimensional test problems known to exhibit the shock instability. The performance of the new solver is compared with that of the standard HLL and HLLC Riemann solvers.</span>

We present a family of novel explicit numerical methods for the diffusion or heat equation with Fisher, Huxley and Nagumo-type reaction terms. After discretizing the space variables as in conventional method of lines, our methods do not apply a finite difference approximation for the time derivatives, they instead combine constant- linear- and quadratic-neighbour approximations, which decouple the ordinary differential equations. In the obtained methods, the time step size appears in exponential form in the final expression with negative coefficients. In the case of the pure heat equation, the new values of the variable are convex combinations of the old values, which guarantees unconditional positivity and stability. We analytically prove that the convergence of the methods is fourth order in the time step size for linear ODE systems. We also prove that the concentration values in the case of Fisher’s and Nagumo’s equations lie within the unit interval regardless of the time step size. We construct an adaptive time step size time integrator with an extremely cheap embedded error control method. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that the proposed methods work for nonlinear equations in stiff cases as well. According to the comparisons with other solvers, the new methods can have a significant advantage.</span>

Improving the quality of low-light images is a fundamental task with vast applications in computer vision. Retinex-based methods which decompose the images into reflectance and illumination components have been actively studied over the past years. In this paper, we propose a Retinex-based method with dual reflectance estimation. To be precise, we start with a simple reflectance estimation based on the HSV color space, which is then accompanied by another variational-based estimation of both the reflectance and illumination. Finally, we bring a new perspective to the Retinex model by reconstructing the normal-light image with a novel transformation map given by the estimated reflectance and illumination, which we call radiance mapping. Extensive experiments show that our method obtains outstanding results, both numerically and visually, compared to state-of-the-art methods.</span>

Finite volume methods are introduced to solve a class of variational inequality of the second kind, which is governed by the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations under nonlinear slip boundary conditions of friction type. The numerical schemes are derived with the use of a proper numerical integration formula (e.g., trapezoidal rule) to approximate the subdifferential term due to the nonlinear constraints. For two particular finite volume schemes, existence and uniqueness of the numerical solutions are proved and optimal order error estimates are derived for solving the Navier–Stokes variational inequality. Numerical results are reported, focusing on the numerical convergence orders and illustrations of the tangential velocity components characterizing the potential slip phenomena.</span>

We propose a second-order accurate semi-implicit and well-balanced finite volume scheme for the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics including gravitational source terms. The scheme treats all terms associated with the acoustic pressure implicitly while keeping the remaining terms part of the explicit sub-system. This semi-implicit approach makes the method particularly well suited for problems in the low Mach regime. We combine the semi-implicit scheme with the deviation well-balancing technique and prove that it maintains equilibrium solutions for the magnetohydrostatic case up to rounding errors. In order to preserve the divergence-free property of the magnetic field enforced by the solenoidal constraint, we incorporate a constrained transport method in the semi-implicit framework. Second order of accuracy is achieved by means of a standard spatial reconstruction technique with total variation diminishing property, and by an asymptotic preserving time stepping algorithm built upon the implicit-explicit Runge–Kutta time integrators. Numerical tests in the low Mach regime and near magnetohydrostatic equilibria support the low Mach and well-balanced properties of the numerical method.</span>

Exponential integrators have been applied successfully in several physics-related differential equations. However, their application in hyperbolic systems with absorbing boundaries, like the ones arising in seismic imaging, still lacks theoretical and experimental investigations. The present work conducts an in-depth study of exponential integration using Faber polynomials, consisting of a generalization of a well-known exponential method that uses Chebyshev polynomials. This allows solving non-symmetric operators that emerge from classic seismic wave propagation problems with absorbing boundaries. Theoretical as well as numerical results are presented for Faber approximations. One of the theoretical contributions is the proposal of a sharp bound for the approximation error of the exponential of a normal matrix. We also show the practical importance of determining an optimal ellipse encompassing the full spectrum of the discrete operator to ensure and enhance the convergence of the Faber exponential series. Furthermore, based on estimates of the spectrum of the discrete operator of the wave equations with a widely used absorbing boundary method, we numerically investigate the stability, dispersion, convergence, and computational efficiency of the Faber exponential scheme. Overall, we conclude that the method is suitable for seismic wave problems and can provide accurate results with large time step sizes, with computational efficiency increasing with the increase of the approximation degree.</span>

In this paper, we derive a novel recovery type a posteriori error estimation of the Crank–Nicolson finite element method for the Cahn–Hilliard equation. To achieve this, we employ both the elliptic reconstruction technique and a time reconstruction technique based on three time-level approximations, resulting in an optimal a posteriori error estimator. We propose a time-space adaptive algorithm that utilizes the derived a posteriori error estimator as error indicators. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical findings, including comparing with an adaptive finite element method based on a residual type a posteriori error estimator.</span>

We present a two-dimensional conforming virtual element method for the fourth-order phase-field equation. Our proposed numerical approach to the solution of this high-order phase-field (HOPF) equation relies on the design of an arbitrary-order accurate, virtual element space with 
                      
                      \(C^{1}\)
                      
                     global regularity. Such regularity is guaranteed by taking the values of the virtual element functions and their full gradient at the mesh vertices as degrees of freedom. Attaining high-order accuracy requires also edge polynomial moments of the trace of the virtual element functions and their normal derivatives. In this work, we detail the scheme construction, and prove its convergence by deriving error estimates in different norms. A set of representative test cases allows us to assess the behavior of the method.</span>

We propose here a convergence analysis for virtual element discretizations of the cardiac Bidomain model, a degenerate system of parabolic reaction-diffusion equations that models the propagation of the electric signal in the cardiac tissue. The virtual element method is a recent numerical technology that generalizes finite elements by considering polytopal computational grids, thus allowing more flexibility and accuracy in approximating complex computational domains. This can be an advantage when modeling for instance damaged cardiac tissues or structural heterogeneities. A previous similar study was performed in Anaya et al. (IMA J Numer Anal 40(2):1544–1576, 2020), where the propagation was modeled by means of a scalar nonlocal FitzHugh-Nagumo reaction-diffusion model. In the present work, we extend this analysis to the full semi-discrete Bidomain system, providing extensive numerical tests that validate the theoretical result on several structured and unstructured meshes.</span>

Radial basis function methods are powerful tools in numerical analysis and have demonstrated good properties in many different simulations. However, for time-dependent partial differential equations, only a few stability results are known. In particular, if boundary conditions are included, stability issues frequently occur. The question we address in this paper is how provable stability for RBF methods can be obtained. We develop a stability theory for global radial basis function methods using the general framework of summation-by-parts operators often used in the Finite Difference and Finite Element communities. Although we address their practical construction, we restrict the discussion to basic numerical simulations and focus on providing a proof of concept.</span>

In this paper, we first derive a theoretical basis for spherical conformal parameterizations between a simply connected closed surface 
                      
                      \(\mathcal {S}\)
                      
                     and a unit sphere 
                      
                      \(\mathbb {S}^2\)
                      
                     by minimizing the Dirichlet energy on 
                      
                      \(\overline{\mathbb {C}}\)
                      
                     with stereographic projection. The Dirichlet energy can be rewritten as the sum of the energies associated with the southern and northern hemispheres and can be decreased under an equivalence relation by alternatingly solving the corresponding Laplacian equations. Based on this theoretical foundation, we develop a modified Dirichlet energy minimization with nonequivalence deflation for the computation of the spherical conformal parameterization between 
                      
                      \(\mathcal {S}\)
                      
                     and 
                      
                      \(\mathbb {S}^2\)
                      
                    . In addition, under some mild conditions, we verify the asymptotically R-linear convergence of the proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments on various benchmarks confirm that the assumptions for convergence always hold and demonstrate the efficiency, reliability and robustness of the developed modified Dirichlet energy minimization.</span>

In this paper, we locally construct a conservative flux for finite element solutions of elliptic interface problems with discontinuous coefficients. Since the Discontinuous Galerkin method has built-in conservative flux, we consider in this paper the conforming finite element method and a special type of nonconforming method with arbitrary orders. We also perform our analysis based on Nitsche’s method, which imposes the Dirichlet boundary condition weakly. The construction method is derived based on a mixed problem with one solution coinciding with the finite element solution and with the other solution being naturally used to obtain a conservative flux. We then apply the recovered flux to the a posteriori error estimation and prove the robust reliability and efficiency for conforming elements, under the assumption that the diffusion coefficient is quasi-monotone. Numerical experiments are provided to verify the theoretical results.</span>
