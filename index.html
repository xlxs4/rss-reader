 Abstract. While a common trend in disease modeling is to develop models of increasing complexity, it was recently pointed out that outbreaks appear remarkably simple when viewed in the incidence vs. cumulative cases (ICC) plane. This article details the theory behind this phenomenon by analyzing the stochastic Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model in the cumulative cases domain. We prove that the Markov chain associated with this model reduces, in the ICC plane, to a pure birth chain for the cumulative number of cases, whose limit leads to an independent increments Gaussian process that fluctuates about a deterministic ICC curve. We calculate the associated variance and quantify the additional variability due to estimating incidence over a finite period of time. We also illustrate the universality brought forth by the ICC concept on real-world data for Influenza A and for the COVID-19 outbreak in Arizona.</span>

 Abstract. We consider a small stochastic perturbation of an optimal velocity car-following model. We give a detailed analysis of behavior near a collision singularity. We show that collision is impossible in a simplified model without noise and then show that collision is asymptotically unlikely over large time intervals in the presence of small noise, with the large time interval scaling like the square of the reciprocal of the strength of the noise.

 Abstract. We introduce a new type of object characterization, which is capable of accurately describing small isolated inclusions for potential field inverse problems such as in electrostatics, magnetostatics, and related low frequency Maxwell problems. Relevant applications include characterizing ferrous unexploded ordnance from magnetostatic field measurements in magnetometry, describing small conducting inclusions for medical imaging using electrical impedance tomography, performing geological ground surveys using electrical resistivity imaging, characterizing objects by electrosensing fish to navigate and identify food, and describing the effective properties of dilute composites. Our object characterization builds on the generalized polarizability tensor (GPT) object characterization concept and provides an alternative to the contracted GPT. We call the new characterizations harmonic GPTs (HGPTs) as their coefficients correspond to products of harmonic polynomials. Then, we show that the number of independent coefficients of HGPTs needed to characterize objects can be significantly reduced by considering the symmetry group of the object and propose a systematic approach for determining the subspace of symmetric harmonic polynomials that is fixed by the group and its dimension. This enables us to determine the independent HGPT coefficients for different symmetry groups.</span>

 Abstract. Production of blood cells is a complex and tightly regulated process. Its quantitative understanding is highly relevant for the treatment of various diseases, including blood cancers. White blood cells (WBCs) originate from the so-called hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population. HSCs give rise to immature WBCs that divide and further differentiate into mature cells. It is still a matter of debate whether cell differentiation resembles a discrete or a continuous process. We propose a novel continuous integral model (CIM) to describe WBC production. In agreement with recent experimental results, the maturity level of cells is described by a one-dimensional continuous variable. The process of maturation is modeled by an integral term that accounts for the influx of cells of maturity level [math] from the differentiation of cells with lower maturity levels. In the model, cell proliferation and differentiation are controlled by a feedback signal which is a function of the mature cell population. We investigate the relationships between the proposed CIM, the multicompartment ordinary differential equations model introduced in [A. Marciniak-Czochra et al., Stem Cells Dev., 18 (2009), pp. 377–385] which treats differentiation as a discrete process, and the partial differential equations model of transport type studied by Doumic et al. [SIAM J. Appl. Math., 71 (2011), pp. 1918–1940] which describes differentiation as a continuous process. We show that both models can be derived from the CIM and we perform numerical simulations to compare them qualitatively.</span>

 Abstract. A program obfuscator takes a program and outputs a “scrambled” version of it, where the goal is that the obfuscated program will not reveal much about its structure beyond what is apparent from executing it. There are several ways of formalizing this goal. Specifically, in indistinguishability obfuscation, first defined by Barak et al. [Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO, 2001, Lect. Notes Comput. Sci. 2139, Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, pp. 1–18], the requirement is that the results of obfuscating any two functionally equivalent programs (circuits) will be computationally indistinguishable. In 2013, a fascinating candidate construction for indistinguishability obfuscation was proposed by Garg et al. [Pr…</span>

 Abstract. Load balancing is a well-studied problem, with balls-in-bins being the primary framework. The greedy algorithm [math] of Azar et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 29 (1999), pp. 180–200] places each ball by probing [math] random bins and placing the ball in the least loaded of them. With high probability, the maximum load under [math] is exponentially lower than the result when balls are placed uniformly randomly. Vöcking [J. ACM, 50 (2003), pp. 568–589] showed that a slightly asymmetric variant, [math], provides a further significant improvement. However, this improvement comes at the additional computational cost of imposing structure on the bins. Here, we present a fully decentralized and easy-to-implement algorithm called [math] that combines the simplicity of [math] and the improved balance of [math]. The key idea in [math] is to probe until a different bin size from the first observation is located and then place the ball. Although the number of probes could be quite large for some of the balls, we show that [math] requires only at most [math] probes on average per ball (in both the standard and the heavily loaded settings). Thus the number of probes is no greater than that of either [math] or [math]. More importantly, we show that [math] closely matches the improved maximum load ensured by [math] in both the standard and heavily loaded settings. We further provide a tight lower bound on the maximum load up to [math] terms. We additionally give experimental data that [math] is indeed as good as [math], if not better, in practice.</span>

 Abstract. Locally correctable codes (LCCs) are error correcting codes [math] which admit local algorithms that correct any individual symbol of a corrupted codeword via a minuscule number of queries. For systematic codes, this notion is stronger than that of locally decodable codes (LDCs), where the goal is to only recover individual symbols of the message. One of the central problems in algorithmic coding theory is to construct [math]-query LCCs and LDCs with minimal block length. Alas, state-of-the-art of such codes requires super-polynomial block length to admit [math]-query algorithms for local correction and decoding, despite much attention during the last two decades. The study of relaxed LCCs and LDCs, which allow the correction algorithm to abort (but not err) on a small fraction of the locations, provides a way to circumvent this barrier. This relaxation turned out to allow constant-query correcting and decoding algorithms for codes with polynomial block length. Focusing on local correction, Gur, Ramnarayan, and Rothblum [Proceedings of the 9th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference, ITCS’18, 2018, pp. 1–27] showed that there exist [math]-query relaxed LCCs that achieve nearly-quartic block length [math], for an arbitrarily small constant [math]. We construct an [math]-query relaxed LCC with nearly-linear block length [math], for an arbitrarily small constant [math]. This significantly narrows the gap between the lower bound which states that there are no [math]-query relaxed LCCs with block length [math]. In particular, our construction matches the parameters achieved by Ben-Sasson et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 36 (2006), pp. 889–974], who constructed relaxed LDCs with the same parameters. This resolves an open problem raised by Gur, Ramnarayan, and Rothblum [Proceedings of the 9th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference, ITCS’18, 2018, pp. 1–27].</span>

 Abstract. Graph sparsification underlies a large number of algorithms, ranging from approximation algorithms for cut problems to solvers for linear systems in the graph Laplacian. In its strongest form, “spectral sparsification” reduces the number of edges to near-linear in the number of nodes, while approximately preserving the cut and spectral structure of the graph. In this work we demonstrate a polynomial quantum speedup for spectral sparsification and many of its applications. In particular, we give a quantum algorithm that, given a weighted graph with [math] nodes and [math] edges, outputs a classical description of an [math]-spectral sparsifier in sublinear time [math]. This contrasts with the optimal classical complexity [math]. We also prove that our quantum algorithm is optimal up to polylog-factors. The algorithm builds on a string of existing results on sparsification, graph spanners, quantum algorithms for shortest paths, and efficient constructions for [math]-wise independent random strings. Our algorithm implies a quantum speedup for solving Laplacian systems and for approximating a range of cut problems such as min cut and sparsest cut.</span>

 Abstract. We present a general framework for designing approximately revenue-optimal mechanisms for multi-item additive auctions, which applies to both truthful and nontruthful auctions. Given a (not necessarily truthful) single-item auction format [math] satisfying certain technical conditions, we run simultaneous item auctions augmented with a personalized entry fee for each bidder that must be paid before the auction can be accessed. These entry fees depend only on the prior distribution of bidder types and in particular are independent of realized bids. We bound the revenue of the resulting two-part tariff mechanism using a novel geometric technique that enables revenue guarantees for many common nontruthful auctions that previously had none. Our approach adapts and extends the duality framework of Cai, Devanur, and Weinberg [SIAM J. Comput., 50 (2021), pp. STOC16-160–STOC16-200] beyond truthful auctions. Our framework can be used with many common auction formats, such as simultaneous first-price, simultaneous second-price, and simultaneous all-pay auctions. Our results for first-price and all-pay are the first revenue guarantees of nontruthful mechanisms in multidimensional environments, addressing an open question in the literature [T. Roughgarden, V. Syrgkanis, and E. Tardos, J. Artificial Intelligence Res., 59 (2017), pp. 59–101]. If all-pay auctions are used, we prove that the resulting mechanism is also credible in the sense that the auctioneer cannot benefit by deviating from the stated mechanism after observing agent bids. This is the first static credible mechanism for multi-item additive auctions that achieves a constant factor of the optimal revenue. If second-price auctions are used, we obtain a truthful [math]-approximate mechanism with fixed entry fees that are amenable to tuning via online learning techniques.</span>

In this paper, we extend the positivity-preserving, entropy stable first-order scheme developed for the one-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes equations in Upperman et al. (J Comput Phys 466, 2022) to three spatial dimensions. The new first-order scheme is provably entropy stable, design-order accurate for smooth solutions, and guarantees the pointwise positivity of thermodynamic variables for 3-D compressible viscous flows. Similar to the 1-D counterpart, the proposed scheme for the 3-D Navier–Stokes equations is discretized on Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto grids used for high-order spectral collocation methods. The positivity of density is achieved by adding an artificial dissipation in the form of the first-order Brenner–Navier–Stokes diffusion operator. Another distinctive feature of the proposed scheme is that the Navier–Stokes viscous terms are discretized by high-order spectral collocation summation-by-parts operators. To eliminate time step stiffness caused by the high-order approximation of the viscous terms and the temperature positivity constraint, the velocity and temperature limiters developed for the 1-D compressible Navier–Stokes equations in Upperman et al. (J. Comput. Phys., 466, 2022) are generalized to three spatial dimensions. These limiters bound the magnitude of velocity and temperature gradients and preserve the entropy stability and positivity properties of the baseline scheme. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate design-order accuracy and positivity-preserving properties of the new first-order scheme for 2-D and 3-D inviscid and viscous flows with strong shocks and contact discontinuities.</span>

                              <span>Accelerating the development of synthetic biology applications requires reproducible experimental findings. Different standards and repositories exist to exchange experimental data and metadata. However, the associated software tools often do not support a uniform data capture, encoding, and exchange of information. A connection between digital repositories is required to prevent siloing and loss of information. To this end, we developed the Experimental Data Connector (XDC). It captures experimental data and related metadata by encoding it in standard formats and storing the converted data in digital repositories. Experimental data is then uploaded to Flapjack and the metadata to SynBioHub in a consistent manner linking these repositories. This produces complete connected experimental datasets that are exchangeable. The information is captured using a single template ExcelWorkbook, which can be integrated into existing experimental workflow automation processes.</span>

                              <span>Bio-computation is the implementation of computational operations using biological substrates, such as cells engineered with synthetic genetic circuits. These genetic circuits can be composed of DNA parts with specific functions, such as promoters that initiate transcription, ribosome binding sites that initiate translation, and coding sequences that are translated into proteins. Compositions of such parts can encode genetic circuits in which the proteins produced by genes regulate each other in different ways. The expression level of each gene may be considered as a signal which may be high or low, encoding binary logic, and the combinations of genes can then encode logic circuits. This is equivalent to the level-based logic used in modern electronic computers in which the voltage forms the logical high or low states.

A different approach to binary logic is to encode the high and low states in the phase of an oscillating signal. In this approach a signal in phase with a reference represents high, and a signal antiphase with the reference represents the logical low state. We present here designs and models for phase-based genetic NOT, OR, AND, MAJORITY and complementary MAJORITY gates, which together form multiple complete logical sets. We derive analytical expressions for the optimal model parameters for circuit function. Our simulation results suggest that this approach to genetic logic is feasible and could be less sensitive to gate input-output mismatch than level-based genetic logic. To demonstrate the scaleability of phase-based genetic logic, we used our complementary MAJORITY and NOT gates to design and simulate a fully functional 4-bit ripple adder circuit, and showed that it was robust to molecular noise.</span>

                              <span>Optimization of the metabolic flux through heterologous pathways to improve bioproduction or utilization of alternative substrates requires both fine-tuning of non-native gene expression levels and improvement of the host genome. The SCRaMbLE system incorporated into synthetic Sc2.0 yeast strains enables a rapid approach to rearrange the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in order to create optimized chassis. Here, we show that the light-inducible Cre recombinase L-SCRaMbLE can efficiently generate diverse recombination events when applied to Sc2.0 strains containing a linear or circular synthetic chromosome III. We present an efficient and straightforward workflow for the identification of complex rearranged synthetic chromosomes from SCRaMbLEd isolates without selection pressure. The screening method is based on novel genotyping primers, the loxPsym tags, which indicate not only deletions but also inversions and translocations. Long-read Nanopore sequencing is used to decode the selected genotypes and shows in conjunction with flow cytometry that large-scale karyotype alterations can be a consequence of SCRaMbLE.</span>

 Abstract. Circadian oscillations have been reported in major renal functions such as renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary excretion. These oscillations can be explained, in part, by the rhythmic variations in renal transporter expressions. However, given that a multitude of renal transporters are regulated by the circadian clock, and that the functions of some of these transporters are coupled, the underlying mechanisms that link variations in transporter expression to the observed changes in kidney function have yet to be fully elucidated. To better understand the impact of the circadian clock on renal solute and water transport, we have developed a computational model of the epithelial transport of the rat kidney that represents the observed rhythmic variations in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and in the activities of Na+/H+ exchanger 3, sodium-gLucose cotransporter 1, epithelial Na+ channels, pendrin, and renal outer-medullary K+ channels. The model predicts the rhythmic oscillations in GFR and key renal transporter activities give rise to a significant shift in transport loads among different nephron segments. Together, these oscillations yield 3-4-fold daily fluctuations in urine output and urinary electrolyte excretion rates.</span>

                              <span>An overview of the computational infrastructure available for genomic research in Japan highlights the importance of establishing hybrid cloud computing platforms. The enormous growth of genomic data necessitates a corresponding increase in computational infrastructure for analyses. A review by Osamu Ogasawara of Japan’s National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka, Japan, highlights the strengths and challenges in the country’s computational infrastructure. Several powerful supercomputers are linked to universities by a high-speed network for transferring large data sets. Commercial cloud services also provide on-demand availability, easy international collaboration, and reproducible workflows. However, the cloud market is dominated by three vendors, and there are concerns about privacy and data security. Ogasawara advocates a hybrid cloud approach allowing for on-premise analyses and movement between vendors, and notes that the government is developing a multi-cloud environment for domestic institutes.</span>

Sequences of weak electrical pulses are considered a promising alternative for terminating ventricular and atrial fibrillations while avoiding strong defibrillation shocks with adverse side effects. In this study, using numerical simulations of four different 2D excitable media, we show that pulse trains with increasing temporal intervals between successive pulses (deceleration pacing) provide high success rates at low energies. Furthermore, we propose a simple and robust approach to calculate inter-pulse spacing directly from the frequency spectrum of the dynamics (for instance, computed based on the electrocardiogram), which can be practically used in experiments and clinical applications.</span>

Noakes and Stoyanov [Mathematics 9, 2434 (2021)] introduced a method of recovering strictly convex planar obstacles from their set of traveling times. We provide an extension of this construction for obstacles on Riemannian surfaces under some general curvature conditions. It is required that no smooth geodesic intersects more than two obstacles.</span>

Advanced numerical models used for climate prediction are known to exhibit biases in their simulated climate response to variable concentrations of the atmospheric greenhouse gases and aerosols that force a non-uniform, in space and time, secular global warming. We argue here that these biases can be particularly pronounced due to misrepresentation, in these models, of the multidecadal internal climate variability characterized by large-scale, hemispheric-to-global patterns. This point is illustrated through the development and analysis of a prototype climate model comprised of two damped linear oscillators, which mimic interannual and multidecadal internal climate dynamics and are set into motion via a combination of stochastic driving, representing weather noise, and deterministic external forcing inducing a secular climate change. The model time series are paired with pre-specified patterns in the physical space and form, conceptually, a spatially extended time series of the zonal-mean near-surface temperature, which is further contaminated by a spatiotemporal noise simulating the rest of climate variability. The choices of patterns and model parameters were informed by observations and climate-model simulations of the 20th century near-surface air temperature. Our main finding is that the intensity and spatial patterns of the internal multidecadal variability associated with the slow-oscillator model component greatly affect (i) the ability of modern pattern-recognition/fingerprinting methods to isolate the forced response of the climate system in the 20th century ensemble simulations and (ii) climate-system predictability, especially decadal predictability, as well as the estimates of this predictability using climate models in which the internal multidecadal variability is underestimated or otherwise misrepresented.</span>

                              <span>Biosensors can accelerate the engineering of new biosynthetic pathways. Phloroglucinol is a platform chemical of wide utility that can be produced at limited titers in Escherichia coli. Starting from the TetR family repressor RolR that is responsive to the related compound resorcinol, we were able to employ a combined selection and screen to identify variants that had greatly improved activities with phloroglucinol (EC50 for phloroglucinol of 131 uM, relative to an estimated 42 mM for wild-type RolR). The variants obtained were further screened with a panel of similar single ring aromatics, and several were found to be generalists, consistent with the hypothesis that both natural and directed evolution tend to first create semi-specific pockets prior to further optimization for new function</span>

                              <span>Abstract
Cellular senescence can induce dual effects (promotion or inhibition) on cancer progression. While immune cells naturally respond and migrate toward various chemotactic sources from the tumor mass, various factors including senescent tumor cells (STCs) in the tumor microenvironment may affect this chemotactic movement. In this work, we investigate the mutual interactions between the tumor cells and the immune cells that either inhibit or facilitate tumor growth by developing a mathematical model that consists of taxis–reaction–diffusion equations and receptor kinetics for the key players in the interaction network. We apply a mathematical model to a transwell Boyden chamber invasion assay used in the experiments to illustrate that STCs can play a pivotal role in negating immune attack through tight regulation of intra- and extra-cellular signaling molecules. In particular, we show that senescent tumor cells in cell cycle arrest can block intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ T cells by secreting a high level of CXCL12, which leads to significant reduction its receptors, CXCR4, on T cells, and thus impaired chemotaxis. The predictions of nonlinear responses to CXCL12 were in good agreement with experimental data. We tested several hypotheses on immune-tumor interactions under various biochemical conditions in the tumor microenvironment and developed new concepts for anti-tumor strategies targeting senescence induced immune impairment.</span>

We study the linear stability properties of spatially localized single- and multi-peak states generated in a subcritical Turing bifurcation in the Meinhardt model of branching. In one spatial dimension, these states are organized in a foliated snaking structure owing to peak–peak repulsion but are shown to be all linearly unstable, with the number of unstable modes increasing with the number of peaks present. Despite this, in two spatial dimensions, direct numerical simulations reveal the presence of stable single- and multi-spot states whose properties depend on the repulsion from nearby spots as well as the shape of the domain and the boundary conditions imposed thereon. Front propagation is shown to trigger the growth of new spots while destabilizing others. The results indicate that multi-variable models may support new types of behavior that are absent from typical two-variable models.</span>

                              <span>Recently, a new subset of fluorescent proteins has been identified from the Aequorea species of jellyfish. These fluorescent proteins were characterized in vivo; however, there has not been validation of these proteins within cell-free systems. Cell-free systems and technology development is a rapidly expanding field, encompassing foundational research, synthetic cells, bioengineering, biomanufacturing and drug development. Cell-free systems rely heavily on fluorescent proteins as reporters. Here we characterize and validate this new set of Aequorea proteins for use in a variety of cell-free and synthetic cell expression platforms.

Accurate simulations of the Stokes–Darcy system face many difficulties including the coupling of flows in two different subdomains via interface conditions, the incompressibility constraint for the free flow and uncertainties in model parameters. In this report, we propose and study efficient, decoupled, artificial compressibility (AC) ensemble schemes based on a recently developed SAV approach for fast computation of Stokes–Darcy flow ensembles. The proposed algorithms (1) do not require any time step condition and (2) decouple the computation of the velocity and pressure in the free flow region, and (3) result in a common coefficient matrix for all realizations after spatial discretization for which efficient iterative linear solvers such as block CG or block GMRES can be used to greatly reduce the computational cost. We prove the long time stability under two parameter conditions, without any timestep constraints. In particular, for one single simulation, they are unconditionally stable schemes. Several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithms and illustrate their applications in realistic flow problems.</span>

The quantized neural network is a common way to improve inference and memory efficiency for deep learning methods. However, it is challenging to solve this optimization problem with good generalization due to its high nonlinearity and nonconvexity. This paper proposes an algorithm to train one-bit quantization neural networks based on sharpness-aware minimization Foret et al. (Sharpness-aware minimization for efficiently improving generalization, 2021) with two types of gradient approximation. The idea is to improve the generalization by finding a local minimum of a flat landscape of both continuous and quantized neural network loss. The convergence theory is partially established under a one-bit quantization setting. Experiments on the CIFAR-10 Krizhevsky (Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images, 2009) and SVHN Netzer et al. (Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning, 2011) datasets show improvement in generalization with the proposed algorithm compared to other state-of-the-art quantized training methods.</span>

                              <span>Many clinically used drugs are derived from or inspired by bacterial natural products that often are biosynthesised via non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), giant megasynthases that activate and join individual amino acids in an assembly line fashion. Since NRPS are not limited to the incorporation of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, their efficient manipulation would allow the biotechnological generation of complex peptides including linear, cyclic and further modified natural product analogues, e.g. to optimise natural product leads. Here we describe a detailed phylogenetic analysis of several bacterial NRPS that led to the identification of a new recombination breakpoint within the thiolation (T) domain that is important for natural NRPS evolution. From this, an evolution-inspired eXchange Unit between T domains (XUT) approach was developed which allows the assembly of NRPS fragments over a broad range of GC contents, protein similarities, and extender unit specificities, as demonstrated for the specific production of a proteasome inhibitor designed and assembled from five different NRPS fragments.</span>

 Abstract. We present a geometric Melnikov method to analyze a two-dimensional stable or unstable manifold associated with a saddle point in three-dimensional nonvolume preserving autonomous flows. The time-varying perturbed location of such a manifold is obtained under very general, nonvolume preserving and with arbitrary time-dependence, perturbations. We demonstrate the explicit computability of the leading-order spatio-temporal location of the manifold using our formulas. In unperturbed situations with a two-dimensional heteroclinic manifold, we adapt our theory to quantify the splitting into a stable and unstable manifold, and thereby obtain an instantaneous flux quantification in terms of a Melnikov function. The time-varying instantaneous flux theory does not require any intersections between perturbed manifolds, nor rely on descriptions of lobe dynamics. Our theory has specific application to transport in fluid mechanics, where the flow is in three dimensions and flow separators in forward/backward time are two-dimensional stable/unstable manifolds. We demonstrate our theory using both the classical and swirling versions of Hill’s spherical vortex.</span>

 Abstract. In this paper, we extend a recently established subgradient method for the computation of Riemannian metrics that optimizes certain singular value functions associated with dynamical systems. This extension is threefold. First, we introduce a projected subgradient method which results in Riemannian metrics whose parameters are confined to a compact convex set and we can thus prove that a minimizer exists; second, we allow inexact subgradients and study the effect of the errors on the computed metrics; and third, we analyze the subgradient algorithm for three different choices of step sizes: constant, exogenous, and Polyak. The new methods are illustrated by application to dimension and entropy estimation of the Hénon map.</span>

 Abstract. We typically interact in groups, not just in pairs. For this reason, it has recently been proposed that the spread of information, opinion, or disease should be modeled over a hypergraph rather than a standard graph. The use of hyperedges naturally allows for a nonlinear rate of transmission, in terms of both the group size and the number of infected group members, as is the case, for example, when social distancing is encouraged. We consider a general class of individual-level, stochastic, susceptible-infected-susceptible models on a hypergraph, and focus on a mean field approximation proposed in [G. F. de Arruda, G. Petri, and Y. Moreno, Phys. Rev. Res., 2 (2020), 023032]. We derive spectral conditions under which the mean field model predicts local or global stability of the infection-free state. We also compare these results with (a) a new condition that we derive for decay to zero in mean for the exact process, (b) conditions for a different mean field approximation in [D. J. Higham and H.-L. de Kergorlay, Proc. A, 477 (2021), 20210232], and (c) numerical simulations of the microscale model.</span>

 Abstract. In a general stochastic multistate promoter model of dynamic messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)/protein interactions, we identify the stationary joint distribution of the promoter state, mRNA, and protein levels through an explicit “stick-breaking&quot; construction perhaps of interest in itself. This derivation is a constructive advance over previous work where the stationary distribution is solved only in restricted cases. Moreover, the stick-breaking construction allows us to sample directly from the stationary distribution, permitting inference procedures and model selection. In this context, we discuss numerical Bayesian experiments to illustrate the results.</span>

 Abstract. We consider a jump-diffusion process on a bounded domain with reflection at the boundary and establish long-term results for a general additive process of its path. This includes the long-term behavior of its occupation time in the interior and on the boundaries. We derive a characterization of the large deviation rate function which quantifies the rate of exponential decay of probabilities of rare events for paths of the process. The characterization relies on a solution of a partial integro-differential equation with boundary constraints. We develop a practical implementation of our results in terms of a numerical solution for the PIDE. We illustrate the method on a few standard examples (Brownian motion, birth-death processes) and on a particular jump-diffusion model arising from applications to biochemical reactions.</span>

In recent times, the fractional-order dynamical networks have gained lots of interest across various scientific communities because it admits some important properties like infinite memory, genetic characteristics, and more degrees of freedom than an integer-order system. Because of these potential applications, the study of the collective behaviors of fractional-order complex networks has been investigated in the literature. In this work, we investigate the influence of higher-order interactions in fractional-order complex systems. We consider both two-body and three-body diffusive interactions. To elucidate the role of higher-order interaction, we show how the network of oscillators is synchronized for different values of fractional-order. The stability of synchronization is studied with a master stability function analysis. Our results show that higher-order interactions among complex networks help the earlier synchronization of networks with a lesser value of first-order coupling strengths in fractional-order complex simplices. Besides that, the fractional-order also shows a notable impact on synchronization of complex simplices. For the lower value of fractional-order, the systems get synchronized earlier, with lesser coupling strengths in both two-body and three-body interactions. To show the generality in the outcome, two neuron models, namely, Hindmarsh–Rose and Morris–Leccar, and a nonlinear Rössler oscillator are considered for our analysis.</span>

Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a leading tool for equation-free analysis of high-dimensional dynamical systems from observations. In this work, we focus on a combination of DMD and delay-coordinates embedding, which is termed delay-coordinates DMD and is based on augmenting observations from current and past time steps, accommodating the analysis of a broad family of observations. An important utility of DMD is the compact and reduced-order spectral representation of observations in terms of the DMD eigenvalues and modes, where the temporal information is separated from the spatial information. From a spatiotemporal viewpoint, we show that when DMD is applied to delay-coordinates embedding, temporal information is intertwined with spatial information, inducing a particular spectral structure on the DMD components. We formulate and analyze this structure, which we term the spatiotemporal coupling in delay-coordinates DMD. Based on this spatiotemporal coupling, we propose a new method for DMD components selection. When using delay-coordinates DMD that comprises redundant modes, this selection is an essential step for obtaining a compact and reduced-order representation of the observations. We demonstrate our method on noisy simulated signals and various dynamical systems and show superior component selection compared to a commonly used method that relies on the amplitudes of the modes.</span>

The Lyapunov exponent method is generally used for classifying hyperchaotic, chaotic, and regular dynamics based on the equations modeling the system. However, several systems do not benefit from appropriate modeling underlying their dynamic behaviors. Therefore, having methods for classifying hyperchaotic, chaotic, and regular dynamics using only the observational data generated either by the theoretical or the experimental systems is crucial. In this paper, we use single nonlinear node delay-based reservoir computers to separate hyperchaotic, chaotic, and regular dynamics. We show that their classification capabilities are robust with an accuracy of up to 99.61% and 99.03% using the Mackey–Glass and the optoelectronic oscillator delay-based reservoir computers, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that the reservoir computers trained with the two-dimensional Hénon-logistic map can classify the dynamical state of another system (for instance, the two-dimensional sine-logistic modulation map). Our solution extends the state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning approaches for chaos detection by introducing the detection of hyperchaotic signals.</span>

A natural circulation system (NCS) has a broad application in the sector of thermal engineering, for example, in nuclear reactors due to its capability in transferring heat without any support of external power or a mechanical device. NCSs, although designed for steady operation, have been found to exhibit dynamical behavior, such as periodic oscillations, depending on the input heater power. The heater power, otherwise assumed to be steady, can be fluctuating in practice. The present study focuses on the dynamics of a single-phase square NCS, which exhibits periodic dynamics and is subjected to an external harmonic perturbation (chosen as the simplest form of fluctuation) over the steady heater power. The objective of the study is to study the dynamics of NCS under external (harmonic) disturbances using the framework of forced synchronization. Toward that, a 1D transient model of a square-shaped NCS is simulated with harmonically forced input power. The transition in the nature of synchronization between mass flux oscillations and the external forcing has been characterized by varying the frequency and amplitude of external perturbation independently. We find different nonlinear effects of the harmonic forcing, such as exhibition of quasiperiodic dynamics, frequency pulling/pushing, and frequency locking or forced synchronization. The aforementioned characterization techniques open up an avenue for detailed analysis of the more complex type of fluctuating input heat in real systems.</span>

While it is well known that the probability density for conventional stochastic differential equations can be obtained by numerically solving the corresponding Fokker–Planck equations, no feasible approaches have been reported to compute the probability density for stochastic differential equations with time delays. Lacking efficient algorithms to compute the probability density has greatly restricted the application of stochastic differential equations with time delays. A numerical method is developed in this paper to compute the probability density for stochastic differential equations with multiple time delays. It is shown that the proposed numerical method is of first order convergence with respect to time step. Numerical examples are presented to verify and illustrate the proposed method.</span>

A fractional order susceptible–exposed–infected–quarantined–recovered model is established on the complex networks. We calculate a specific expression for the basic reproduction number [math], prove the existence and uniqueness with respect to the solution, and prove the Ulam–Hyers stability of the model. Using the Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient method, the influence of parameters on the [math] is analyzed. Based on the results of the analysis, the optimal control of the model is investigated as the control variables with vaccination rate and quarantine rate applying Pontryagin’s minimum principle. The effects of [math], degree of nodes, and network size on the model dynamics are simulated separately by the prediction correction method.</span>

We present and validate simple and efficient methods to estimate the chaoticity of orbits in low-dimensional conservative dynamical systems, namely, autonomous Hamiltonian systems and area-preserving symplectic maps, from computations of Lagrangian descriptors (LDs) on short time scales. Two quantities are proposed for determining the chaotic or regular nature of orbits in a system’s phase space, which are based on the values of the LDs of these orbits and of nearby ones: The difference and ratio of neighboring orbits’ LDs. Using as generic test models the prototypical two degree of freedom Hénon–Heiles system and the two-dimensional standard map, we find that these indicators are able to correctly characterize the chaotic or regular nature of orbits to better than 90% agreement with results obtained by implementing the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI) method, which is a well-established chaos detection technique. Further investigating the performance of the two introduced quantities, we discuss the effects of the total integration time and of the spacing between the used neighboring orbits on the accuracy of the methods, finding that even typical short time, coarse-grid LD computations are sufficient to provide reliable quantification of the systems’ chaotic component, using less CPU time than the SALI. In addition to quantifying chaos, the introduced indicators have the ability to reveal details about the systems’ local and global chaotic phase space structure. Our findings clearly suggest that LDs can also be used to quantify and investigate chaos in continuous and discrete low-dimensional conservative dynamical systems.</span>

In this paper, an origami structure of period-1 motions to spiral homoclinic orbits in parameter space is presented for the Rössler system. The edge folds of the origami structure are generated by the saddle-node bifurcations. For each edge, there are two layers to form the origami structure. On one layer of the origami structure, there is a pair of period-doubling bifurcations inducing periodic motions from period-1 to period-2n motions [math]. On such a layer, the unstable period-1 motion goes to the homoclinic orbits with a mapping eigenvalue approaching negative infinity. However, on the corresponding adjacent layers, no period-doubling bifurcations exist, and the unstable period-1 motion goes to the homoclinic orbit with a mapping eigenvalue approaching positive infinity. To determine the origami structure of the period-1 motions to homoclinic orbits, the implicit map of the Rössler system is developed through the discretization of the corresponding differential equations. The Poincaré mapping section can be selected arbitrarily. Before construction of the origami structure, the bifurcation diagram of periodic motions varying with one parameter is developed, and trajectories of stable periodic motions on the bifurcation diagram to homoclinic orbits are illustrated. Finally, the origami structures of period-1 motions to homoclinic orbits are developed through a few layers. This study provides the mathematical mechanisms of period-1 motions to homoclinic orbits, which help one better understand the complexity of periodic motions near the corresponding homoclinic orbit. There are two types of infinitely many homoclinic orbits in the Rössler system, and the corresponding mapping structures of the homoclinic orbits possess positive and negative infinity large eigenvalues. Such infinitely many homoclinic orbits are induced through unstable periodic motions with positive and negative eigenvalues accordingly.</span>

Macroscopic magnets can easily be manipulated and positioned so that interactions between themselves and with external fields induce interesting dynamics and equilibrium configurations. In this work, we use rotating magnets positioned in a line or at the vertices of a regular polygon. The rotation planes of the magnets can be modified at will. The rich structure of stable and unstable configurations is dictated by symmetry and the side of the polygon. We show that both symmetric solutions and their symmetry-breaking bifurcations can be explained with group theory. Our results suggest that the predicted magnetic textures should emerge at any length scale as long as the interaction is polar, and the system is endowed with the same symmetries.</span>

The average value of a system variable determines the position of its attractor. When the offset parameters come together and get disappeared after an algebraic operation, the location of the attractor is then governed by an initial condition only. In this case, parameter-dominated offset control turns out to be the initial condition-defined coexisting attractors. In this Letter, a special mechanism for generating countless coexisting attractors is disclosed. Furthermore, a new regime of multistability is revealed, which explains where and how countless coexisting attractors are born and arranged.</span>

The role of topological heterogeneity in the origin of extreme events in a network is investigated here. The dynamics of the oscillators associated with the nodes are assumed to be identical and influenced by mean-field repulsive interactions. An interplay of topological heterogeneity and the repulsive interaction between the dynamical units of the network triggers extreme events in the nodes when each node succumbs to such events for discretely different ranges of repulsive coupling. A high degree node is vulnerable to weaker repulsive interactions, while a low degree node is susceptible to stronger interactions. As a result, the formation of extreme events changes position with increasing strength of repulsive interaction from high to low degree nodes. Extreme events at any node are identified with the appearance of occasional large-amplitude events (amplitude of the temporal dynamics) that are larger than a threshold height and rare in occurrence, which we confirm by estimating the probability distribution of all events. Extreme events appear at any oscillator near the boundary of transition from rotation to libration at a critical value of the repulsive coupling strength. To explore the phenomenon, a paradigmatic second-order phase model is used to represent the dynamics of the oscillator associated with each node. We make an annealed network approximation to reduce our original model and, thereby, confirm the dual role of the repulsive interaction and the degree of a node in the origin of extreme events in any oscillator associated with a node.</span>

Phylogenetic diversity indices such as the Fair Proportion (FP) index are frequently discussed as prioritization criteria in biodiversity conservation. They rank species according to their contribution to overall diversity by taking into account the unique and shared evolutionary history of each species as indicated by its placement in an underlying phylogenetic tree. Traditionally, phylogenetic trees were inferred from single genes and the resulting gene trees were assumed to be a valid estimate for the species tree, i.e., the “true” evolutionary history of the species under consideration. However, nowadays it is common to sequence whole genomes of hundreds or thousands of genes, and it is often the case that conflicting genealogical histories exist in different genes throughout the genome, resulting in discordance between individual gene trees and the species tree. Here, we analyze the effects of gene and species tree discordance on prioritization decisions based on the FP index. In particular, we consider the ranking order of taxa induced by (i) The FP index on a species tree, and (ii) The expected FP index across all gene tree histories associated with the species tree. On the one hand, we show that for particular tree shapes, the two rankings always coincide. On the other hand, we show that for all leaf numbers greater than or equal to five, there exist species trees for which the two rankings differ. Finally, we illustrate the variability in the rankings obtained from the FP index across different gene tree and species tree estimates for an empirical multilocus mammal data set.</span>

Phylogenetic networks extend phylogenetic trees to model non-vertical inheritance, by which a lineage inherits material from multiple parents. The computational complexity of estimating phylogenetic networks from genome-wide data with likelihood-based methods limits the size of networks that can be handled. Methods based on pairwise distances could offer faster alternatives. We study here the information that average pairwise distances contain on the underlying phylogenetic network, by characterizing local and global features that can or cannot be identified. For general networks, we clarify that the root and edge lengths adjacent to reticulations are not identifiable, and then focus on the class of zipped-up semidirected networks. We provide a criterion to swap subgraphs locally, such as 3-cycles, resulting in indistinguishable networks. We propose the “distance split tree”, which can be constructed from pairwise distances, and prove that it is a refinement of the network’s tree of blobs, capturing the tree-like features of the network. For level-1 networks, this distance split tree is equal to the tree of blobs refined to separate polytomies from blobs, and we prove that the mixed representation of the network is identifiable. The information loss is localized around 4-cycles, for which the placement of the reticulation is unidentifiable. The mixed representation combines split edges for 4-cycles, regular tree and hybrid edges from the semidirected network, and edge parameters that encode all information identifiable from average pairwise distances.</span>

The finite difference multi-resolution alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (MR-AWENO) scheme has been designed to solve hyperbolic conservation laws (Wang et al. in Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 382:113853, 2021). However, the scheme is not scale-invariant and generates numerical oscillations near strong shocks. To overcome this issue, we design the scale-invariant Si-weights and the MR-AWENO-Si operator by including the new global smoothness indicator and the descaler. The resulting scale-invariant MR-AWENO-Si scheme captures discontinuity of any scale in the essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) way efficiently and robustly. We also demonstrate an interesting application of the scale-invariant scheme to achieve the well-balanced property for the compressible Euler equations under a gravitational potential field by modifying the numerical fluxes, reformulating the source terms, and enforcing the MR-AWENO-Si operator. A theoretical proof is given, and extensive one- and two-dimensional classical examples are used to verify the performance of the MR-AWENO-Si scheme in terms of accuracy, robustness, and well-balanced property.</span>

                              <span>Genome editing requires precision to broadly move on to industrial and clinical applications. For this reason, homologous directed repair (HDR) is one of the preferred methods for small edits, other than knock-outs. However, HDR has low efficiency. Current investigations to enhance HDR have mainly gone in the direction of finding non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) inhibitors. NHEJ is crucial for cellular integrity, then the inhibition of this pathway is detrimental for the correct survival of living entities. In other studies, a second opportunity is given to HDR by targeting the byproducts of NHEJ, using an extra gRNA. In this study, we propose the use of a meiotic factor, PRDM9, to directly enhance homology recombination. Through the exploration of combinatorial factors and donor design, we have established an optimized protocol for HDR. PRDM9-Cas9 fusion combined with CtIP improves HDR/NHEJ ratio. In addition, we have validated this combinatorial approach for small edits through a traffic light reporter system, as well as for longer edits with a split-GFP reporter system.</span>

                              <span>To probe signal propagation and genetic actuation in microbial consortia, we have coopted the components of both redox and quorum sensing (QS) signaling into a communication network for guiding composition by &quot;programming&quot; cell lysis. Here, we use an electrode to generate hydrogen peroxide as a redox cue that determines consortia composition. The oxidative stress regulon of Escherichia coli, OxyR, is employed to receive and transform this signal into a QS signal that coordinates the lysis of a subpopulation of cells. We examine a suite of information transfer modalities including &quot;monoculture&quot; and &quot;transmitter-receiver&quot; models, as well as a series of genetic circuits that introduce time-delays for altering information relay, thereby expanding design space. A simple mathematical model aids in developing communication schemes that accommodate the transient nature of redox signals and the &quot;collective&quot; attributes of QS signals. We suggest this platform methodology will be useful in understanding and controlling synthetic microbial consortia for a variety of applications, including biomanufacturing and biocontainment.</span>

                              <span>Membrane abscission, the final cut of the last connection between emerging daughter cells, is an indispensable event in the last stage of cell division, as well as in other cellular processes such as endocytosis, virus release, or bacterial sporulation. However, its mechanism remains poorly understood, which also impedes its application as a cell-division machinery for synthetic cells. Here, we use fluorescence microscopy and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) to study the in vitro reconstitution of the bacterial protein Dynamin A (DynA) inside liposomes. Upon external reshaping of the liposomes into dumbbells, DynA self-assembles at the membrane neck, resulting in membrane hemi-scission and even full scission. DynA proteins constitute a simple one-component division machinery that is capable of splitting dumbbell-shaped liposomes, marking an important step towards building a synthetic cell.</span>

Recent progress in nanotechnology-enabled sensors that can be placed inside of living plants has shown that it is possible to relay and record real-time chemical signaling stimulated by various abiotic and biotic stresses. The mathematical form of the resulting local reactive oxygen species (ROS) wave released upon mechanical perturbation of plant leaves appears to be conserved across a large number of species, and produces a distinct waveform from other stresses including light, heat and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-induced stresses. Herein, we develop a quantitative theory of the local ROS signaling waveform resulting from mechanical stress in planta. We show that nonlinear, autocatalytic production and Fickian diffusion of H2O2 followed by first order decay well describes the spatial and temporal properties of the waveform. The reaction–diffusion system is analyzed in terms of a new approximate solution that we introduce for such problems based on a single term logistic function ansatz. The theory is able to describe experimental ROS waveforms and degradation dynamics such that species-dependent dimensionless wave velocities are revealed, corresponding to subtle changes in higher moments of the waveform through an apparently conserved signaling mechanism overall. This theory has utility in potentially decoding other stress signaling waveforms for light, heat and PAMP-induced stresses that are similarly under investigation. The approximate solution may also find use in applied agricultural sensing, facilitating the connection between measured waveform and plant physiology.</span>

                              <span>In resource-limited settings, it can be difficult to safely deliver sensitive biologic medicines to patients due to cold chain and infrastructure constraints. Point-of-care drug manufacturing could circumvent these challenges because medicines could be produced locally and used on-demand. Towards this vision, we combine cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) and a 2-in-1 affinity purification and enzymatic cleavage scheme to develop a platform for point-of-care drug manufacturing. As a model, we use this platform to synthesize a panel of peptide hormones, an important class of medications that can be used to treat a wide variety of diseases including diabetes, osteoporosis, and growth disorders. With this approach, temperature-stable lyophilized CFPS reaction components can be rehydrated with DNA encoding a SUMOylated peptide hormone of interest when needed. Strep-Tactin(R) affinity purification and on-bead SUMO protease cleavage yields peptide hormones in their native form that are recognized by ELISA antibodies and that can bind their respective receptors. With further development to ensure proper biologic activity and patient safety, we envision this platform could be used to manufacture valuable peptide hormone drugs at the point-of-care in resource-limited settings.</span>

Inference of species networks from genomic data under the Network Multispecies Coalescent Model is currently severely limited by heavy computational demands. It also remains unclear how complicated networks can be for consistent inference to be possible. As a step toward inferring a general species network, this work considers its tree of blobs, in which non-cut edges are contracted to nodes, so only tree-like relationships between the taxa are shown. An identifiability theorem, that most features of the unrooted tree of blobs can be determined from the distribution of gene quartet topologies, is established. This depends upon an analysis of gene quartet concordance factors under the model, together with a new combinatorial inference rule. The arguments for this theoretical result suggest a practical algorithm for tree of blobs inference, to be fully developed in a subsequent work.</span>

 Abstract. In this paper, we study the generalized multiscale finite element method (GMsFEM) for single phase compressible flow in highly heterogeneous porous media. We follow the major steps of the GMsFEM to construct a permeability dependent offline basis for fast coarse-grid simulation. The offline coarse space is efficiently constructed only once based on the initial permeability field with parallel computing. A rigorous convergence analysis is performed for two types of snapshot spaces. The analysis indicates that the convergence rates of the proposed multiscale method depend on the coarse meshsize and the eigenvalue decay of the local spectral problem. To further increase the accuracy of the multiscale method, a residual driven online multiscale basis is added to the offline space. The construction of an online multiscale basis is based on a carefully designed error indicator motivated by the analysis. We find that an online basis is particularly important for the singular source. Rich numerical tests on typical 3D highly heterogeneous media are presented to demonstrate the impressive computational advantages of the proposed multiscale method.</span>

 Abstract. Small-scale features of shallow water flow obtained from direct numerical simulation (DNS) with two different computational codes for the shallow water equations are gathered offline and subsequently employed with the aim of constructing a reduced-order correction. This is used to facilitate high-fidelity online flow predictions at much reduced costs on coarse meshes. The resolved small-scale features at high resolution represent subgrid properties for the coarse representation. Measurements of the subgrid dynamics are obtained as the difference between the evolution of a coarse grid solution and the corresponding DNS result. The measurements are sensitive to the particular numerical methods used for the simulation on coarse computational grids and can be used to approximately correct the associated discretization errors. The subgrid features are decomposed into empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), after which a corresponding correction term is constructed. By increasing the number of EOFs in the approximation of the measured values the correction term can in principle be made arbitrarily accurate. Both computational methods investigated here show a significant decrease in the simulation error already when applying the correction based on the dominant EOFs only. The error reduction accounts for the particular discretization errors that are incurred and are hence specific to the particular simulation method that is adopted. This improvement is also observed for very coarse grids, which may be used for computational model reduction in geophysical and turbulent flow problems.</span>

 Abstract. Triadic closure describes the tendency for new friendships to form between individuals who already have friends in common. It has been argued heuristically that the triadic closure effect can lead to bistability in the formation of large-scale social interaction networks. Here, depending on the initial state and the transient dynamics, the system may evolve towards either of two long-time states. In this work, we propose and study a hierarchy of network evolution models that incorporate triadic closure, building on the work of Grindrod, Higham, and Parsons [Internet Math., 8 (2012), pp. 402–423]. We use a chemical kinetics framework, paying careful attention to the reaction rate scaling with respect to the system size. In a macroscale regime, we show rigorously that a bimodal steady state distribution is admitted. This behavior corresponds to the existence of two distinct stable fixed points in a deterministic mean-field ODE. The macroscale model is also seen to capture an apparent metastability property of the microscale system. Computational simulations are used to support the analysis.</span>

 Abstract. This article examines the homogenization issue for the Stokes system in a domain with an oscillating boundary portion. On the oscillating boundary, we impose inhomogeneous oscillating Dirichlet boundary data. The proposed method is an attempt to develop the homogenization technique for the nonstationary Stokes system on noncylindrical domains. To resolve the uniform bound of solutions with respect to heterogeneous parameters, we transform the system into a reference domain and demonstrate its existence and uniqueness in the reference domain. In order to homogenize the velocity and pressure in the reference domain, two-scale convergence is employed. In contrast to all other available homogenization techniques, the one presented in this work is easily adaptable to evolving domains. We also establish error estimates for the homogenized system approximation by transforming the system into its initial configuration.</span>

 Abstract. This study constructs a new diffuse-domain (DD) lattice Boltzmann (LB) method for two-phase flows in complex geometries. We first coupled the DD method with the consistent and conservative phase-field (CCPF) method which can be described by the DD-CC Navier–Stokes–Cahn–Hilliard (NSCH) equations with the consistency of reduction, the consistency of mass and momentum transport, and the consistency of mass conservation. Then we conducted a matched asymptotic analysis and found that the DD-CCNSCH equations would converge to the CCNSCH equations as the thickness of the DD interface approaches to zero. Since the boundary conditions imposed on the complex geometries are incorporated into the DD-CCNSCH equations as the source terms, the system can be implemented more readily in a large and regular domain, and there is no need to treat the complex boundary conditions specially. We further developed a DD-CCPFLB method, and through the Chapman–Enskog analysis, the DD-CCPFLB method can correctly recover the DD-CCNSCH equations for two-phase flows in complex geometries. To quantitatively validate the DD-CCPFLB method, three benchmark problems are considered, and the numerical results are in agreement with those obtained through directly solving the CCNSCH equations combined with the original boundary conditions, the analytical solution, or the reported data. Finally, the present method is used to study the problems of two-phase flows in complex geometries, including the droplet dynamics in the Y-shaped channel and a droplet passing through cylindrical obstacles. The effects of the wettability and viscosity ratio are mainly investigated, and it is found that these two factors have significant impacts on the droplet dynamics.</span>

 Abstract. We develop a mathematical model that describes concentration dynamics of PrP[math] (Prion Protein Cellular) and PrP[math] (Prion Protein Scrapie) prion proteins at the neuron scale and includes the effect of the unfolded protein response (UPR). We first introduce a single neuron model taking the UPR mechanism into account. We investigate it and propose a stability study among which a bifurcation analysis with respect to three of its parameters. Then, we generalize it to two neurons showing PrP[math] proteins interaction. Stability results are given when neurons exhibit identical parameters but interact differently (strong, weak, or no interaction).</span>

 Abstract. Koopman operator theory has gained interest in the past decade as a framework for rigorously transforming nonlinear dynamics on the state space into linear dynamics on Koopman-invariant function spaces. These Koopman-invariant spaces can be approximated purely through data-driven methodologies, which then enables future state prediction and the application of classical linear control to strongly nonlinear systems. Recently in literature, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) was developed for systems represented through eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator. However, the controller was limited to using real-valued eigenfunctions for conservative systems. In this paper, we extend the Koopman LQR framework to use multiple complex eigenfunctions. We illustrate in several examples that our proposed extension enables Koopman LQR to control dissipative systems and to drive different nonlinear oscillators to stabilize at nonequilibrium points and follow arbitrarily prescribed targets, which was not possible using a single real-valued Koopman eigenfunction.</span>

 Abstract. Periodic waves of the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation are identified in the context of a new variational problem with two constraints. The advantage of this variational problem is that its nondegenerate local minimizers are stable in the time evolution of the mKdV equation, whereas the saddle points are unstable. We explore the analytical representation of periodic waves given by Jacobi elliptic functions and compute numerically critical points of the constrained variational problem. A broken pitchfork bifurcation of three smooth solution families is found. Two families represent (stable) minimizers of the constrained variational problem and one family represents (unstable) saddle points.</span>

 Abstract. We analyze a family of clustered excitatory-inhibitory neural networks and the underlying bifurcation structures that arise because of permutation symmetries in the network as the global coupling strength [math] is varied. We primarily consider two network topologies: an all-to-all connected network which excludes self-connections, and a network in which the excitatory cells are broken into clusters of equal size. Although in both cases the bifurcation structure is determined by symmetries in the system, the behavior of the two systems is qualitatively different. In the all-to-all connected network, the system undergoes Hopf bifurcations leading to periodic orbit solutions; notably, for large [math], there is a single, stable periodic orbit solution and no stable fixed points. By contrast, in the clustered network, there are no Hopf bifurcations, and there is a family of stable fixed points for large [math].</span>

 Abstract. Localized persistent cortical neural activity is a validated neural substrate of parametric working memory. Such activity “bumps” represent the continuous location of a cue over several seconds. Pyramidal (excitatory (E)) and interneuronal (inhibitory (I)) subpopulations exhibit tuned bumps of activity, linking neural dynamics to behavioral inaccuracies observed in memory recall. However, many bump attractor models collapse these subpopulations into a single joint E/I(lateral inhibitory) population and do not consider the role of interpopulation neural architecture and noise correlations. Both factors have a high potential to impinge upon the stochastic dynamics of these bumps, ultimately shaping behavioral response variance. In our study, we consider a neural field model with separate E/I populations and leverage asymptotic analysis to derive a nonlinear Langevin system describing E/I bump interactions. While the E bump attracts the I bump, the I bump stabilizes but can also repel the E bump, which can result in prolonged relaxation dynamics when both bumps are perturbed. Furthermore, the structure of noise correlations within and between subpopulations strongly shapes the variance in bump position. Surprisingly, higher interpopulation correlations reduce variance.</span>

Nonlinear complex network-coupled systems typically have multiple stable equilibrium states. Following perturbations or due to ambient noise, the system is pushed away from its initial equilibrium, and, depending on the direction and the amplitude of the excursion, it might undergo a transition to another equilibrium. It was recently demonstrated [M. Tyloo, J. Phys. Complex. 3 03LT01 (2022)] that layered complex networks may exhibit amplified fluctuations. Here, I investigate how noise with system-specific correlations impacts the first escape time of nonlinearly coupled oscillators. Interestingly, I show that, not only the strong amplification of the fluctuations is a threat to the good functioning of the network but also the spatial and temporal correlations of the noise along the lowest-lying eigenmodes of the Laplacian matrix. I analyze first escape times on synthetic networks and compare noise originating from layered dynamics to uncorrelated noise.</span>

The box-covering method plays a fundamental role in the fractal property recognition and renormalization analysis of complex networks. This study proposes the hub-collision avoidance and leaf-node options (HALO) algorithm. In the box sampling process, a forward sampling rule (for avoiding hub collisions) and a reverse sampling rule (for preferentially selecting leaf nodes) are determined for bidirectional network traversal to reduce the randomness of sampling. In the box selection process, the larger necessary boxes are preferentially selected to join the solution by continuously removing small boxes. The compact-box-burning (CBB) algorithm, the maximum-excluded-mass-burning (MEMB) algorithm, the overlapping-box-covering (OBCA) algorithm, and the algorithm for combining small-box-removal strategy and maximum box sampling with a sampling density of 30 (SM30)  are compared with HALO in experiments. Results on nine real networks show that HALO achieves the highest performance score and obtains 11.40%, 7.67%, 2.18%, and 8.19% fewer boxes than the compared algorithms, respectively. The algorithm determinism is significantly improved. The fractal dimensions estimated by covering four standard networks are more accurate. Moreover, different from MEMB or OBCA, HALO is not affected by the tightness of the hubs and exhibits a stable performance in different networks. Finally, the time complexities of HALO and the compared algorithms are all [math], which is reasonable and acceptable.</span>

The aim of this study is to formulate a new methodology based upon informational tools to detect patients with cardiac arrhythmias. As it is known, sudden death is the consequence of a final arrhythmia, and here lies the relevance of the efforts aimed at the early detection of arrhythmias. The information content in the time series from an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is conveyed in the form of a probability distribution function, to compute the permutation entropy proposed by Bandt and Pompe. This selection was made seeking its remarkable conceptual simplicity, computational speed, and robustness to noise. In this work, two well-known databases were used, one containing normal sinus rhythms an…</span>

Robotic tasks often exceed the scope of steady-state or periodic behavior, which necessitates generally-applicable models of actuators intended to generate transient or aperiodic motion. However, existing electromechanical models of servomotors typically omit consideration of the switching power converter circuits required for directional, speed, or torque control. In this study, a multi-domain framework is established for switched electromechanical dynamics in servomotor systems for their analysis and control in general aperiodic tasks including transient phases. The switched electromechanical dynamics is derived from the individual models of the internal DC motor, gear train, and H-bridge circuit. The coupled models comprehensively integrate all possible distinct switching configurations of on-state, off-state, and dead time. A combination of cycle averaging with piecewise analytical solutions of the non-smooth dynamics is introduced to handle different temporal scales from high-frequency electrical to low-frequency mechanical variables. System parameters were estimated from experimental data using a dual-servomotor test platform. The model was validated for predictive accuracy against measured data in two distinct tasks—dynamic braking of a pendulum system and sinusoidal trajectory following. The model was also used to formulate the servomotor power consumption, which was implemented for optimal control demonstration and energy analysis. In particular, the servomotor power consumption model provided true optimality (minimization) when compared with the squared rotor torque and the positive rotor mechanical power that are commonly used as proxy models. While the focus of this work is on permanent-magnet, armature-controlled brushed DC servomotors, the approach is applicable to general electromechanical systems with switching-based control.</span>

During the second half of October 2019, Chile, especially the capital city, Santiago, suffered from widespread violence and public and private infrastructure destruction. This work aims to expand an epidemiological non-local model that successfully described the French riots of 2005 to incorporate the topology of Santiago’s subway network and explain the reported distribution of rioting activity in the city. Although the model reproduced the disorders’ aggregated temporal evolution, it could not deliver results resembling the observed spatial distribution of activity on Santiago. The main reason for this failure can be attributed to the fact that the model lacks a population displacement mechanism, which seems vital to explain Santiago’s unrest episodes.</span>

The Watts–Strogatz networks are important models that interpolate between regular lattices and random graphs, and Barabási–Albert networks are famous models that explain the origin of the scale-free networks. Here, we consider the first encounters between two particles (e.g., prey A and predator B) embedded in the Watts–Strogatz networks and the Barabási–Albert networks. We address numerically the mean first-encounter time (MFET) while the two particles are moving and the mean first-passage time (MFPT) while the prey is fixed, aiming at uncovering the impact of the prey’s motion on the encounter time, and the conditions where the motion of the prey would accelerate (or slow) the encounter between the two particles. Different initial conditions are considered. In the case where the two particles start independently from sites that are selected randomly from the stationary distribution, on the Barabási–Albert networks, the MFET is far less than the MFPT, and the impact of prey’s motion on the encounter time is enormous, whereas, on the Watts–Strogatz networks (including Erdős-Rényi random networks), the MFET is about 0.5–1 times the MFPT, and the impact of prey’s motion on the encounter time is relatively small. We also consider the case where prey A starts from a fixed site and the predator starts from a randomly drawn site and present the conditions where the motion of the prey would accelerate (or slow) the encounter between the two particles. The relation between the MFET (or MFPT) and the average path length is also discussed.</span>

Predictive states for stochastic processes are a nonparametric and interpretable construct with relevance across a multitude of modeling paradigms. Recent progress on the self-supervised reconstruction of predictive states from time-series data focused on the use of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Here, we examine how Wasserstein distances may be used to detect predictive equivalences in symbolic data. We compute Wasserstein distances between distributions over sequences (“predictions”) using a finite-dimensional embedding of sequences based on the Cantor set for the underlying geometry. We show that exploratory data analysis using the resulting geometry via hierarchical clustering and dimension reduction provides insight into the temporal structure of processes ranging from the relatively simple (e.g., generated by finite-state hidden Markov models) to the very complex (e.g., generated by infinite-state indexed grammars).</span>

We study the extreme transient dynamics of four self-excited pendula coupled via the movable beam. A slight difference in the pendula lengths induces the appearance of traveling phase behavior, within which the oscillators synchronize, but the phases between the nodes change in time. We discuss various scenarios of traveling states (involving different pendula) and their properties, comparing them with classical synchronization patterns of phase-locking. The research investigates the problem of transient dynamics preceding the stabilization of the network on a final synchronous attractor, showing that the width of transient windows can become extremely long. The relation between the behavior of the system within the transient regime and its initial conditions is examined and described. Our results include both identical and non-identical pendula masses, showing that the distribution of the latter ones is related to the transients. The research performed in this paper underlines possible transient problems occurring during the analysis of the systems when the slow evolution of the dynamics can be misinterpreted as the final behavior.</span>

Splay states of the amplitude envelope are stably observed as a heterogenous node is introduced into the globally coupled identical oscillators with repulsive coupling. With the increment of the frequency mismatches between the heterogenous nodes and the rest identical globally coupled oscillators, the formal stable splay state based on the time series becomes unstable, while a splay state based on the new-born amplitude envelopes of time series is stably observed among the rest identical oscillators. The characteristics of the splay state based on the amplitude envelope are numerically and theoretically presented for different parameters of the coupling strength [math] and the frequency mismatches [math] for small coupling strength and large frequency mismatches. We expect that all these results could reveal the generality of splay states in coupled nonidentical oscillators and help to understand the rich dynamics of amplitude envelopes in multidisciplinary fields.</span>

Population dynamics and evolutionary genetics underly the structure of ecosystems, changing on the same timescale for interacting species with rapid turnover, such as virus (e.g. HIV) and immune response. Thus, an important problem in mathematical modeling is to connect ecology, evolution and genetics, which often have been treated separately. Here, extending analysis of multiple virus and immune response populations in a resource—prey (consumer)—predator model from Browne and Smith (2018), we show that long term dynamics of viral mutants evolving resistance at distinct epitopes (viral proteins targeted by immune responses) are governed by epistasis in the virus fitness landscape. In particular, the stability of persistent equilibrium virus-immune (prey-predator) network structures, such as nested and one-to-one, and bifurcations are determined by a collection of circuits defined by combinations of viral fitnesses that are minimally additive within a hypercube of binary sequences representing all possible viral epitope sequences ordered according to immunodominance hierarchy. Numerical solutions of our ordinary differential equation system, along with an extended stochastic version including random mutation, demonstrate how pairwise or multiplicative epistatic interactions shape viral evolution against concurrent immune responses and convergence to the multi-variant steady state predicted by theoretical results. Furthermore, simulations illustrate how periodic infusions of subdominant immune responses can induce a bifurcation in the persistent viral strains, offering superior host outcome over an alternative strategy of immunotherapy with strongest immune response.</span>

The interferential current (IFC) therapy is a noninvasive electrical neurostimulation technique intended to activate deep neurons using surface electrodes. In IFC, two independent kilohertz-frequency currents purportedly intersect where an interference field is generated. However, the effects of IFC on neurons within and outside the interference field are not completely understood, and it is unclear whether this technique can reliable activate deep target neurons without side effects. In recent years, realistic computational models of IFC have been introduced to quantify the effects of IFC on brain cells, but they are often complex and computationally costly. Here, we introduce a simplified model of IFC based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model of a neuron. By considering a modified averaging method, we obtain a non-autonomous approximated system, with explicit representation of relevant IFC parameters. For this approximated system we determine conditions under which it reliably approximates the complete FHN system under IFC stimulation, and we mathematically prove its ability to predict nonspiking states. In addition, we perform numerical simulations that show that the interference effect is observed only for a narrow set of IFC parameters and, in particular, for a beat frequency no higher than about 100 [Hz]. Our novel model tailored to the IFC technique contributes to the understanding of neurostimulation modalities using this type of signals, and can have implications in the design of noninvasive electrical stimulation therapies.</span>

In this paper, we consider numerical analysis for a fully discrete scheme for the stochastic Stokes–Darcy equations with multiplicative noise. Implicit Euler scheme is used for the time discretization, and interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG) scheme based on the BDM

                     finite element space is used for the space discretization. Physical interface conditions are imposed to couple the fluid equations in free fluid and porous media regions. It is proved that the implicit Euler scheme for the stochastic Stokes–Darcy equations is unconditionally stable. Under usual assumptions for the multiplicative noise and regularity of the velocity, we present the optimal convergence analysis in both time and space discretizations. Moreover, our stability result and error estimates for the velocity are independent of pressure. Numerical results are given to verify the theoretical analysis.</span>

In this paper, we solve nonlinear conservation laws using the radial basis function generated finite difference (RBF-FD) method. Nonlinear conservation laws have solutions that entail strong discontinuities and shocks, which give rise to numerical instabilities when the solution is approximated by a numerical method. We introduce a residual-based artificial viscosity (RV) stabilization framework adjusted to the RBF-FD method, where the residual of the conservation law adaptively locates discontinuities and shocks. The RV stabilization framework is applied to the collocation RBF-FD method and the oversampled RBF-FD method. Computational tests confirm that the stabilized methods are reliable and accurate in solving scalar conservation laws and conservation law systems such as compressible Euler equations.</span>

 Abstract. Significant past work has characterized properties of canard solutions, which spend unexpectedly long times near dynamically unstable manifolds in the phase space of an underlying dynamical system. We have recently introduced techniques to identify and analyze rivers, which are a class of trajectories that can serve as transient attractors in phase space. In this work, after generalizing the concept of rivers to arbitrary dimensions and introducing a classification of rivers, we show that maximal canards in systems with one fast and two slow variables are rivers of infinite order, or river canards. We use this relationship to provide new insights about how nearby trajectories behave and about how river canards organize the flow near the fold of a critical manifold. This analysis includes the calculation of the way-in way-out function, which provides an estimate for the extent of the delay in escape that trajectories experience when passing near the fold of a critical manifold with canard dynamics, without the need for complexification of time. We also illustrate our results for the well-known autocatalator system.</span>

 Abstract. We study a system of ordinary differential equations in [math] that is used as a model both in population dynamics and in game theory and is known to exhibit a heteroclinic network consisting in the union of four types of elementary heteroclinic cycles. We show the asymptotic stability of the network for parameter values in a range compatible with both population and game dynamics. We obtain estimates of the relative attractiveness of each one of the cycles by computing their stability indices. For the parameter values ensuring the asymptotic stability of the network we relate the attractiveness properties of each cycle to the others. In particular, for three of the cycles we show that if one of them has a weak form of attractiveness, then the other two are completely unstable. We also show the existence of an open region in parameter space where all four cycles are completely unstable and the network is asymptotically stable, giving rise to intricate dynamics that has been observed numerically by other authors.</span>

 Abstract. Particles suspended in fluid flow through a curved duct focus to stable equilibrium positions in the duct cross-section due to the balance of two dominant forces: (i) inertial lift force, arising from the inertia of the fluid, and (ii) secondary drag force, resulting from cross-sectional vortices induced by the curvature of the duct. Such particle focusing is exploited in various medical and industrial technologies aimed at separating particles by size. Using the theoretical model developed by Harding, Stokes, and Bertozzi [J. Fluid Mech., 875 (2019), pp. 1–43], we numerically investigate the dynamics of neutrally buoyant particles in fluid flow through curved ducts with rectangular cross-sections at low flow rates. We explore the rich bifurcations that take place in the particle equilibria as a function of three system parameters—particle size, duct bend radius, and aspect ratio of the cross-section. We also explore the transient dynamics of particles as they focus to their equilibria by delineating the effects of these three parameters, as well as the initial location of the particle inside the cross-section, on the focusing dynamics.</span>

 Abstract. We develop a simple financial market model in which a market maker adjusts the price with respect to orders placed by chartists and fundamentalists. A novel feature of our model is that fundamentalists optimistically (pessimistically) believe in a relatively high (low) fundamental value when the financial market is increasing (decreasing). As it turns out, the dynamics of our model is driven by a two-dimensional discontinuous piecewise linear map for which we provide an in-depth analytical and numerical investigation. Among other things, we obtain in explicit form the boundaries of the periodicity regions associated with attracting cycles with rotation number [math], [math] These boundaries correspond to border collision bifurcations of the related cycles. We show that the periodicity regions are organized in a specific period adding structure, and some of the regions may overlap. Several examples of coexisting cycles and their basins of attraction are also presented. Economically, our results offer a new explanation for the boom-bust behavior of actual financial markets.</span>

 Abstract. We study the problem of parameter estimation for large exchangeable interacting particle systems when a sample of discrete observations from a single particle is known. We propose a novel method based on martingale estimating functions constructed by employing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the generator of the mean field limit, where the law of the process is replaced by the (unique) invariant measure of the mean field dynamics. We then prove that our estimator is asymptotically unbiased and asymptotically normal when the number of observations and the number of particles tend to infinity, and we provide a rate of convergence toward the exact value of the parameters. Finally, we present several numerical experiments which show the accuracy of our estimator and corroborate our theoretical findings, even in the case that the mean field dynamics exhibit more than one steady state.</span>

 Abstract. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of circumstances under which wave dynamics can be fully reconstructed from sensor networks. We prove that, in many cases, wave dynamics can be fully reconstructed from a single sensor, but that such reconstructions can be sensitive to small perturbations in sensor placement. In general, multiple sensors are necessary, and we outline a procedure for reconstructing the dynamics from them. We also show that if a network of [math] sensors suffers from Gaussian noise, then the reconstruction error decreases as [math]. We illustrate and verify these results numerically by simulating wave dynamics and then reconstructing from sensor data the initial state of the system and time series of the system at randomly chosen locations.</span>

 Abstract. Networks are a widely used tool for investigating the large-scale connectivity structure in complex systems and graphons have been proposed as an infinite-size limit of dense networks. The detection of communities or other meso-scale structures is a prominent topic in network science as it allows the identification of functional building blocks in complex systems. Similarly, we may want to simplify graphons in terms of communities, in order to gain a comprehensible description of their meso-scale structure. This raises the question of how communities in graphons can be identified. In this paper, we define a graphon modularity and demonstrate that it can be maximized to detect communities in graphons. We then investigate specific synthetic graphons and show that they may show a wide range of different community structures. We also reformulate the graphon-modularity maximization as a continuous optimization problem and so prove the optimal community structure or lack thereof for some graphons, something that is usually not possible for networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that estimating a graphon from network data as an intermediate step can improve the detection of communities, in comparison with exclusively maximizing the modularity of the network. While the choice of graphon estimator may strongly influence the accord between the community structure of a network and its estimated graphon, we find that there is a substantial overlap if an appropriate estimator is used. Our study demonstrates that community detection for graphons is possible and may serve as a privacy-preserving way to cluster network data.</span>

Cancer progression can be described by continuous-time Markov chains whose state space grows exponentially in the number of somatic mutations. The age of a tumor at diagnosis is typically unknown. Therefore, the quantity of interest is the time-marginal distribution over all possible genotypes of tumors, defined as the transient distribution integrated over an exponentially distributed observation time. It can be obtained as the solution of a large linear system. However, the sheer size of this system renders classical solvers infeasible. We consider Markov chains whose transition rates are separable functions, allowing for an efficient low-rank tensor representation of the linear system’s operator. Thus we can reduce the computational complexity from exponential to linear. We derive a convergent iterative method using low-rank formats whose result satisfies the normalization constraint of a distribution. We also perform numerical experiments illustrating that the marginal distribution is well approximated with low rank.</span>

Nonlinear dynamics of discontinuous oscillators with unilateral constraints and non-random parametric uncertainties are investigated. Nonlinear oscillators considering single- and double-sided constraints are carefully constructed to exhibit rich bifurcations, such as period-doubling and Neimark–Sacker bifurcations. In deterministic amplitude–frequency responses, both hardening and softening effects are induced by non-smooth contact-type nonlinearities. Stabilities of the solutions are determined by the shooting method and the monodromy matrix. To effectively quantify the behaviors of nonlinear oscillators in the presence of parametric uncertainties, a non-intrusive surrogate function aided by arc-length ratio interpolation is constructed. Simulation results demonstrate variabilities of nonlinear responses under different non-random uncertainties. Moreover, an accuracy verification is provided to verify the effectiveness of the non-intrusive uncertainty propagation method. It is found that the surrogate function in combination with the arc-length ratio technique has high accuracy and evolutions of turning points are captured satisfactorily regardless of complex interactions of nonlinearities and uncertainties. The findings and methodologies reported are meaningful to general nonlinear systems having complex motions, paving the road for more in-depth investigations into uncertain nonlinear dynamics.</span>

This paper clarifies the mechanism of the dynamic characteristics of the water-lubricated bearing-rotor coupling system at different operating stages. Dynamic models of the water-lubricated bearing-rotor system under fluid lubrication are developed. The influences of different operating modules on the dynamic characteristics are investigated. The effects of different speeds, different loads, and different impacts are analyzed. The time domain responses, axis orbits, and phase diagram are gained. Velocity has impacts on the vibration performance of the shaft. The external load has slight effects on the vibration characteristics. Different forms of transient impacts have different effects on the vibration characteristics. The validity of the new-built models is verified by experiments. Results provide theoretical foundations for the optimum design for such bearing-rotor systems.</span>

In this paper, using the algorithm due to Ablowitz et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 184101 (2022); J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 55, 384010 (2022)], we explore the anomalous dispersive relations, inverse scattering transform, and fractional [math]-soliton solutions of the integrable fractional higher-order nonlinear Schrödinger (fHONLS) equations, containing the fractional third-order NLS (fTONLS), fractional complex mKdV (fcmKdV), and fractional fourth-order nonlinear Schrödinger (fFONLS) equations, etc. The inverse scattering problem can be solved exactly by means of the matrix Riemann–Hilbert problem with simple poles. As a consequence, an explicit formula is found for the fractional [math]-soliton solutions of the fHONLS equations in the reflectionless case. In particular, we analyze the fractional one-, two-, and three-soliton solutions with anomalous dispersions of fTONLS and fcmKdV equations. The wave, group, and phase velocities of these envelope fractional one-soliton solutions are related to the power laws of their amplitudes. Moreover, we also deduce the formula for the fractional [math]-soliton solutions of all fHONLS equations and analyze some velocities of the one-soliton solution. These obtained fractional [math]-soliton solutions may be useful to explain the related super-dispersion transports of nonlinear waves in fractional nonlinear media.</span>

The phenomenon of slow passage through a Hopf bifurcation is ubiquitous in multiple-timescale dynamical systems, where a slowly varying quantity replacing a static parameter induces the solutions of the resulting slow–fast system to feel the effect of the Hopf bifurcation with a delay. This phenomenon is well understood in the context of smooth slow–fast dynamical systems; in the present work, we study it for the first time in piecewise linear (PWL) slow–fast systems. This special class of systems is indeed known to reproduce all features of their smooth counterpart while being more amenable to quantitative analysis and offering some level of simplification, in particular, through the existence of canonical (linear) slow manifolds. We provide conditions for a PWL slow–fast system to exhibit a slow passage through a Hopf-like bifurcation, in link with possible connections between canonical attracting and repelling slow manifolds. In doing so, we fully describe the so-called way-in/way-out function. Finally, we investigate this slow passage effect in the Doi–Kumagai model, a neuronal PWL model exhibiting elliptic bursting oscillations.</span>

A method for controlling the coupling strength is proposed for pulsed coupled active chemical micro-cells. The method is consistent with Hebb’s rules. The effect of various system parameters on this “spike-timing-dependent plasticity” is studied. In addition to networks of two and three coupled active cells, the effect of this “plasticity” on the dynamic modes of a network of four pulse-coupled chemical micro-cells unidirectionally coupled in a circle is studied. It is shown that the proposed adjustment of the coupling strengths leads to spontaneous switching between network eigenmodes.</span>

We study the time-dependent behavior of dissipative solitons (DSs) stabilized by nonlinear gradient terms. Two cases are investigated: first, the case of the presence of a Raman term, and second, the simultaneous presence of two nonlinear gradient terms, the Raman term and the dispersion of nonlinear gain. As possible types of time-dependence, we find a number of different possibilities including periodic behavior, quasi-periodic behavior, and also chaos. These different types of time-dependence are found to form quite frequently from a window structure of alternating behavior, for example, of periodic and quasi-periodic behaviors. To analyze the time dependence, we exploit extensively time series and Fourier transforms. We discuss in detail quantitatively the question whether all the DSs found for the cubic complex Ginzburg–Landau equation with nonlinear gradient terms are generic, meaning whether they are stable against structural perturbations, for example, to the additions of a small quintic perturbation as it arises naturally in an envelope equation framework. Finally, we examine to what extent it is possible to have different types of DSs for fixed parameter values in the equation by just varying the initial conditions, for example, by using narrow and high vs broad and low amplitudes. These results indicate an overlapping multi-basin structure in parameter space.</span>

We propose an image recognition approach using a single physical node based optical reservoir computing. Specifically, an optically injected semiconductor laser with self-delayed feedback is used as the reservoir. We perform a handwritten-digit recognition task by greatly increasing the number of virtual nodes in delayed feedback using outputs from multiple delay times. Final simulation results confirm that the recognition accuracy can reach 99% after systematically optimizing the reservoir hyperparameters. Due to its simple architecture, this scheme may provide a resource-efficient alternative approach to image recognition.</span>

We study the relationship between the structures of the nonlinear localized waves and the distribution characteristics of the modulation stability regime in a nonlinear fiber with both third-order and fourth-order effects. On the background frequency and background amplitude plane, the modulation stability region consists of two symmetric curves on the left and right and a point on the symmetry axis. We find that the higher-order excitation characteristics are obviously different at different positions in the modulation stability region. Their excitation characteristics are closely related to the modulation instability distribution characteristics of the system. It is shown that asymmetric high-order rational solitons are excited at the left and right stable curves, and the symmetric one is excited at the stable points. Interestingly, the asymmetric higher-order rational solitons on the left and right sides are mirror-symmetrical to each other, which coincides with the symmetry of the modulation instability distribution. These results can deepen our understanding of the relationship between nonlinear excitation and modulation instability and enrich our knowledge about higher-order nonlinear excitations.</span>

A platform-vibrator with shock is a low-frequency machine used in the construction industry for compaction and molding of large concrete products. Its mathematical model is a two-degree-of-freedom two-body vibro-impact system with a soft impact. Some changes in its parameters can increase the machine performance and improve the product quality, but these same changes may lead to the emergence of critical states, such as coexisting regimes in hysteresis zone, chaotic motion, intermittency and crisis-induced intermittency, crises, and transient chaos. Some of them can be undesirable and dangerous. This article shows their diagnostics and recognition, the possibility of their prediction, as well as the criterion determining the set of parameter ranges where critical states can occur. Diagnostics is carried out both by traditional tools and by the less common ones, such as the construction of fractal structures and wavelet characteristics.</span>

A concrete example beyond the usual grading of tests occurs with recommendation letters, where a recommender assigns a score to a candidate, but the reliability of the recommender must be assessed as well. Here, we present a statistical procedure, based on Bayesian inference and Jaynes’ maximum entropy principle, that can be used to estimate the most probable and expected score given the available information in the form of a credible interval. Our results may provide insights on how to properly state and analyze problems related to the uncertain evaluation of performance in learning applied to several contexts, beyond the case study of the recommendation letters presented here.</span>

Key features of biological activity can often be captured by transitions between a finite number of semi-stable states that correspond to behaviors or decisions. We present here a broad class of dynamical systems that are ideal for modeling such activity. The models we propose are chaotic heteroclinic networks with nontrivial intersections of stable and unstable manifolds. Due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, transitions between states are seemingly random. Dwell times, exit distributions, and other transition statistics can be built into the model through geometric design and can be controlled by tunable parameters. To test our model’s ability to simulate realistic biological phenomena, we turned to one of the most studied organisms, C. elegans, well known for its limited behavioral states. We reconstructed experimental data from two laboratories, demonstrating the model’s ability to quantitatively reproduce dwell times and transition statistics under a variety of conditions. Stochastic switching between dominant states in complex dynamical systems has been extensively studied and is often modeled as Markov chains. As an alternative, we propose here a new paradigm, namely, chaotic heteroclinic networks generated by deterministic rules (without the necessity for noise). Chaotic heteroclinic networks can be used to model systems with arbitrary architecture and size without a commensurate increase in phase dimension. They are highly flexible and able to capture a wide range of transition characteristics that can be adjusted through control parameters.</span>

Biological neurons can exhibit complex coexisting multiple firing patterns dependent on initial conditions. To this end, this paper presents a novel adaptive synapse-based neuron (ASN) model with sine activation function. The ASN model has time-varying equilibria with the variation of externally applied current and its equilibrium stability involves transitions between stable and unstable points through fold and Hopf bifurcations, resulting in complex distributions of attractive regions with heterogeneous multi-stability. Globally coexisting heterogeneous behaviors are studied by bifurcation diagram, phase portrait, dynamical distribution, and basin of attraction. The results show that the number of coexisting heterogeneous attractors can be up to 12, but for a simple neuron model, such a large number of coexisting heterogeneous attractors has not been reported in the relevant literature. Most interestingly, the ASN model also has riddled-like complex basins of attraction and four illustrative examples are depicted by the phase portraits with small changes of the initial conditions. Besides, the ASN model is implemented using a simple microcontroller platform, and various heterogeneous coexisting attractors are acquired experimentally to validate the numerical results.</span>

This paper studies distributionally robust optimization (DRO) when the ambiguity set is given by moments for the distributions. The objective and constraints are given by polynomials in decision variables. We reformulate the DRO with equivalent moment conic constraints. Under some general assumptions, we prove the DRO is equivalent to a linear optimization problem with moment and psd polynomial cones. A Moment-SOS relaxation method is proposed to solve it. Its asymptotic and finite convergence are shown under certain assumptions. Numerical examples are presented to show how to solve DRO problems.</span>

Reduced-order modelling and low-dimensional surrogate models generated using machine learning algorithms have been widely applied in high-dimensional dynamical systems to improve the algorithmic efficiency. In this paper, we develop a system which combines reduced-order surrogate models with a novel data assimilation (DA) technique used to incorporate real-time observations from different physical spaces. We make use of local smooth surrogate functions which link the space of encoded system variables and the one of current observations to perform variational DA with a low computational cost. The new system, named generalised latent assimilation can benefit both the efficiency provided by the reduced-order modelling and the accuracy of data assimilation. A theoretical analysis of the difference between surrogate and original assimilation cost function is also provided in this paper where an upper bound, depending on the size of the local training set, is given. The new approach is tested on a high-dimensional (CFD) application of a two-phase liquid flow with non-linear observation operators that current Latent Assimilation methods can not handle. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed assimilation approach can significantly improve the reconstruction and prediction accuracy of the deep learning surrogate model which is nearly 1000 times faster than the CFD simulation.</span>

It is well known that Keller–Segel models serve as a paradigm to describe the self aggregation phenomenon, which exists in a variety of biological processes such as wound healing, tumor growth, etc. In this paper, we study the existence of monotone decreasing spiky steady state and its linear stability property in the Keller–Segel model with logistic growth over one-dimensional bounded domain subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Under the assumption that chemo-attractive coefficient is asymptotically large, we construct the single boundary spike and next show this non-constant steady state is locally linear stable via Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction method. As a consequence, the multi-symmetric spikes are obtained by reflection and periodic extension. In particular, we present the formal analysis to illustrate our rigorous theoretical results.</span>

In this paper, we present and introduce two efficient Hamiltonian conservative fully discrete numerical schemes for Korteweg-de Vries equations. The new numerical schemes are constructed by using time-stepping spectral Petrov-Galerkin (SPG) or Gauss collocation (SGC) methods for the temporal discretization coupled with the p-version/spectral local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods for the space discretization. We prove that the fully discrete SPG-LDG scheme preserves both the momentum and the Hamilton energy exactly for generalized KdV equations. While the fully discrete SGC-LDG formulation preserves the momentum and the Hamilton energy exactly for linearized KdV equations. As for nonlinear KdV equations, the SGC-LDG scheme preserves the momentum exactly and is Hamiltonian conserving up to some spectral accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the fully-discrete SGC-LDG and SPG-LDG methods converge exponentially with respect to the polynomial degree in both space and time for linear KdV equations. The numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate that the proposed numerical methods preserve the momentum,

This article studies the asymptotic profiles of coexistence endemic equilibrium solutions of a two-strain reaction-diffusion epidemic model with mass-action incidence when the diffusion rates are sufficiently small. We address the question of how the population size and environmental heterogeneity impact the persistence and extinction of the disease when the diffusion rates approach zero. In particular, we show that there is a sharp critical number which depends delicately on the infected groups’ diffusion rates and each strain’s spatially heterogeneous infection and recovery rates. Moreover, if the total size of the population is kept below this critical number, then the disease could be eradicated by restricting the susceptible hosts’ movement . However, if the total population exceeds this critical number, the disease may persist no matter how the movement of the susceptible hosts is controlled. Additionally, our results suggest that the disease may persist if the diffusion rates of the infected groups are kept sufficiently smaller than that of the susceptible group.</span>

The emergence and persistence of polymorphism within populations generally requires specific regimes of natural or sexual selection. Here, we develop a unified theoretical framework to explore how polymorphism at targeted loci can be generated and maintained by either disassortative mating choice or balancing selection due to, for example, heterozygote advantage. To this aim, we model the dynamics of alleles at a single locus A in a population of haploid individuals, where reproductive success depends on the combination of alleles carried by the parents at locus A. Our theoretical study of the model confirms that the conditions for the persistence of a given level of allelic polymorphism depend on the relative reproductive advantages among pairs of individuals. Interestingly, equilibria with unbalanced allelic frequencies were shown to emerge from successive introduction of mutants. We then investigate the role of the function linking allelic divergence to reproductive advantage on the evolutionary fate of alleles within the population. Our results highlight the significance of the shape of this function for both the number of alleles maintained and their level of genetic divergence. Large number of alleles are maintained with substantial replacement of alleles, when disassortative advantage slowly increases with allelic differentiation . In contrast, few highly differentiated alleles are predicted to be maintained when genetic differentiation has a strong effect on disassortative advantage. These opposite effects predicted by our model explain how disassortative mate choice may lead to various levels of allelic differentiation and polymorphism, and shed light on the effect of mate preferences on the persistence of balanced and unbalanced polymorphism in natural population.</span>

Cancer is usually considered a genetic disease caused by alterations in genes that control cellular behaviors, especially growth and division. Cancer cells differ from normal tissue cells in many ways that allow them to grow out of control and become invasive. However, experiments have shown that aberrant growth in many tissues burdened with varying numbers of mutant cells can be corrected, and wild-type cells are required for the active elimination of mutant cells. These findings reveal the dynamic cellular behaviors that lead to a tissue homeostatic state when faced with mutational and nonmutational insults. The current study was motivated by these observations and established a mathematical model of how a tissue copes with the aberrant behavior of mutant cells. The proposed model depicts the interaction between wild-type and mutant cells through a system of two delay differential equations, which include the random mutation of normal cells and the active extrusion of mutant cells. Based on the proposed model, we performed qualitative analysis to identify the conditions of either normal tissue homeostasis or uncontrolled growth with varying numbers of abnormal mutant cells. Bifurcation analysis suggests the conditions of bistability with either a small or large number of mutant cells, the coexistence of bistable steady states can be clinically beneficial by driving the state of mutant cell predominance to the attraction basin of the state with a low number of mutant cells. This result is further confirmed by the treatment strategy obtained from optimal control theory.</span>

Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve fibers has always been an attractive field of research. Due to the higher activation threshold, the stimulation of small fibers is accompanied by the stimulation of larger ones. It is therefore necessary to design a specific stimulation theme in order to only activate narrow fibers. There is evidence that stimulating Aδ fibers can activate endogenous pain-relieving mechanisms. However, both selective stimulation and reducing pain by activating small nociceptive fibers are still poorly investigated. In this study, using high-frequency stimulation waveforms (5–20 kHz), computational modeling provides a simple framework for activating narrow nociceptive fibers. Additionally, a model of myelinated nerve fibers is modified by including sodium–potassium pump and investigating its effects on neuronal stimulation. Besides, a modified mathematical model of pain processing circuits in the dorsal horn is presented that consists of supraspinal pain control mechanisms. Hence, by employing this pain-modulating model, the mechanism of the reduction of pain by activating nociceptive fibers is explored. In the case of two fibers with the same distance from the point source electrode, a single stimulation waveform is capable of blocking one large fiber and stimulating another small fiber. Noteworthy, the Na/K pump model demonstrated that it does not have a significant effect on the activation threshold and firing frequency of fiber. Ultimately, results suggest that the descending pathways of Locus coeruleus may effectively contribute to pain relief through stimulation of nociceptive fibers, which will be beneficial for clinical interventions.</span>

We propose and analyze numerical schemes for the gradient flow of Q-tensor with the quasi-entropy. The quasi-entropy is a strictly convex, rotationally invariant elementary function, giving a singular potential constraining the eigenvalues of Q within the physical range 
                      
                      \((-1/3,2/3)\)
                      
                    . Compared with the potential derived from the Bingham distribution, the quasi-entropy has the same asymptotic behavior and underlying physics. Meanwhile, it is very easy to evaluate because of its simple expression. For the elastic energy, we include all the rotationally invariant terms. The numerical schemes for the gradient flow are built on the nice properties of the quasi-entropy. The first-order time discretization is uniquely solvable, keeping the physical constraints and energy dissipation, which are all independent of the time step. The second-order time discretization keeps the first two properties unconditionally, and the third with an O(1) restriction on the time step. These results also hold when we further incorporate a second-order discretization in space. Error estimates are also established for time discretization and full discretization. Numerical examples about defect patterns are presented to validate the theoretical results.</span>

The shape of cells and the control thereof plays a central role in a variety of cellular processes, including endo- and exocytosis, cell division and cell movement. Intra- and extracellular forces control the shapes, and while the shape changes in some processes such as exocytosis are intracellularly-controlled and localized in the cell, movement requires force transmission to the environment, and the feedback from it can affect the cell shape and mode of movement used. The shape of a cell is determined by its cytoskeleton (CSK), and thus shape changes involved in various processes involve controlled remodeling of the CSK. While much is known about individual components involved in these processes, an integrated understanding of how intra- and extracellular signals are coupled to the control of the mechanical changes involved is not at hand for any of them. As a first step toward understanding the interaction between intracellular forces imposed on the membrane and cell shape, we investigate the role of distributed surrogates for cortical forces in producing the observed three-dimensional shapes. We show how different balances of applied forces lead to such shapes, that there are different routes to the same end state, and that state transitions between axisymmetric shapes need not all be axisymmetric. Examples of the force distributions that lead to protrusions are given, and the shape changes induced by adhesion of a cell to a surface are studied. The results provide a reference framework for developing detailed models of intracellular force distributions observed experimentally, and provide a basis for studying how movement of a cell in a tissue or fluid is influenced by its shape.</span>

 Abstract. We investigate the local equilibrium (LE) distribution of a crystal surface jump process as it approaches its hydrodynamic (continuum) limit in a nonstandard scaling regime introduced by Marzuola and Weare. The atypical scaling leads to a local equilibrium state whose structure is novel to the best of our knowledge. The distinguishing characteristic of the new, rough LE state is that the ensemble average of single lattice site observables do not vary smoothly across lattice sites. We investigate numerically and analytically how the rough LE state affects the convergence mechanism via three key limits, and we show that by comparison more standard, “smooth” LE states satisfy stronger versions of these limits.</span>

The Sackin and Colless indices are two widely-used metrics for measuring the balance of trees and for testing evolutionary models in phylogenetics. This short paper contributes two results about the Sackin and Colless indices of trees. One result is the asymptotic analysis of the expected Sackin and Colless indices of tree shapes (which are full binary rooted unlabelled trees) under the uniform model where tree shapes are sampled with equal probability. Another is a short direct proof of the closed formula for the expected Sackin index of phylogenetic trees (which are full binary rooted trees with leaves being labelled with taxa) under the uniform model.</span>

Various environmental alterations resulting from the current global change compromise the persistence of species in their habitual environment. To cope with the obvious risk of extinction, plastic responses provide organisms with rapid acclimatization to new environments. The premise of plastic rescue has been theoretically studied from mathematical models in both deterministic and stochastic environments, focusing on analyzing the persistence and stability of the populations. Here, we evaluate this premise in the framework of a consumer-resource interaction considering the energy investment towards reproduction vs. maintenance as a plastic trait according to positive/negative variation of the available resource. A basic consumer-resource mathematical model is formulated based on the principle of biomass conversion that incorporates the energy allocation toward vital functions of the life-cycle of consumer individuals. Our mathematical approach is based on the impulsive differential equations at fixed moments considering two impulsive effects associated with the instants at which consumers obtain environmental information and when energy allocation strategy change occurs. From a preliminary analysis of the non-plastic temporal dynamics, namely when the energy allocation is constant over time and without experiencing changes concerning the variation of resources, both the persistence and stability of the consumer-resource dynamic are dependent on the energy allocation strategies belonging to a set termed stability range. We found that the plastic energy allocation can promote a stable dynamical pattern in the consumer-resource interaction depending on both the magnitude of the energy allocation change and the time lag between environmental sensibility instants and when the expression of the plastic trait occurs.</span>

Non-linear partial differential Kolmogorov equations are successfully used to describe a wide range of time dependent phenomena, in natural sciences, engineering or even finance. For example, in physical systems, the Allen–Cahn equation describes pattern formation associated to phase transitions. In finance, instead, the Black–Scholes equation describes the evolution of the price of derivative investment instruments. Such modern applications often require to solve these equations in high-dimensional regimes in which classical approaches are ineffective. Recently, an interesting new approach based on deep learning has been introduced byby E, Han and Jentzen [1, 2]. The main idea is to construct a deep network which is trained from the samples of discrete stochastic differential equations underlying Kolmogorov’s equation. The network is able to approximate, numerically at least, the solutions of the Kolmogorov equation with polynomial complexity in whole spatial domains. In this contribution we study variants of the deep networks by using different discretizations schemes of the stochastic differential equation. We compare the performance of the associated networks, on benchmarked examples, and show that, for some discretization schemes, improvements in the accuracy are possible without affecting the observed computational complexity.</span>

In this manuscript a POD-Galerkin based Reduced Order Model for unsteady Fluid-Structure Interaction problems is presented. The model is based on a partitioned algorithm, with semi-implicit treatment of the coupling conditions. A Chorin–Temam projection scheme is applied to the incompressible Navier–Stokes problem, and a Robin coupling condition is used for the coupling between the fluid and the solid. The coupled problem is based on an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation, and the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition procedure is used for the generation of the reduced basis. We extend existing works on a segregated Reduced Order Model for Fluid-Structure Interaction to unsteady problems that couple an incompressible, Newtonian fluid with a linear elastic solid, in two spatial dimensions. We consider three test cases to assess the overall capabilities of the method: an unsteady, non-parametrized problem, a problem that presents a geometrical parametrization of the solid domain, and finally, a problem where a parametrization of the solid’s shear modulus is taken into account.</span>

A method for the multifidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC) estimation of statistical quantities is proposed which is applicable to computational budgets of any size. Based on a sequence of optimization problems each with a globally minimizing closed-form solution, this method extends the usability of a well known MFMC algorithm, recovering it when the computational budget is large enough. Theoretical results verify that the proposed approach is at least as optimal as its namesake and retains the benefits of multifidelity estimation with minimal assumptions on the budget or amount of available data, providing a notable reduction in variance over simple Monte Carlo estimation.</span>

                              <span>Abstract
This is the third paper in a series in which we develop machine learning (ML) moment closure models for the radiative transfer equation. In our previous work (Huang et al. in J Comput Phys 453:110941, 2022), we proposed an approach to learn the gradient of the unclosed high order moment, which performs much better than learning the moment itself and the conventional 
                      
                      \(P_N\)
                      
                     closure. However, while the ML moment closure has better accuracy, it is not able to guarantee hyperbolicity and has issues with long time stability. In our second paper (Huang et al., in: Machine learning moment closure models for the radiative transfer equation II: enforcing global hyperbolicity in gradient based closures, 2021. arXiv:2105.14410), we identified a symmetrizer which leads to conditions that enforce that the gradient based ML closure is symmetrizable hyperbolic and stable over long time. The limitation of this approach is that in practice the highest moment can only be related to four, or fewer, lower moments. In this paper, we propose a new method to enforce the hyperbolicity of the ML closure model. Motivated by the observation that the coefficient matrix of the closure system is a lower Hessenberg matrix, we relate its eigenvalues to the roots of an associated polynomial. We design two new neural network architectures based on this relation. The ML closure model resulting from the first neural network is weakly hyperbolic and guarantees the physical characteristic speeds, i.e., the eigenvalues are bounded by the speed of light. The second model is strictly hyperbolic and does not guarantee the boundedness of the eigenvalues. Several benchmark tests including the Gaussian source problem and the two-material problem show the good accuracy, stability and generalizability of our hyperbolic ML closure model.</span>

The orthogonal decomposition factorizes a tensor into a sum of an orthogonal list of rank-one tensors. The corresponding rank is called orthogonal rank. We present several properties of orthogonal rank, which are different from those of tensor rank in many aspects. For instance, a subtensor may have a larger orthogonal rank than the whole tensor. To fit the orthogonal decomposition, we propose an algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian method. The gradient of the objective function has a nice structure, inspiring us to use gradient-based optimization methods to solve it. We guarantee the orthogonality by a novel orthogonalization process. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method has a great advantage over the existing methods for strongly orthogonal decompositions in terms of the approximation error.</span>

In this paper, we extend the class of kernel methods, the so-called diffusion maps (DM) and ghost point diffusion maps (GPDM), to solve the time-dependent advection-diffusion PDE on unknown smooth manifolds without and with boundaries. The core idea is to directly approximate the spatial components of the differential operator on the manifold with a local integral operator and combine it with the standard implicit time difference scheme. When the manifold has a boundary, a simplified version of the GPDM approach is used to overcome the bias of the integral approximation near the boundary. The Monte-Carlo discretization of the integral operator over the point cloud data gives rise to a mesh-free formulation that is natural for randomly distributed points, even when the manifold is embedded in high-dimensional ambient space. Here, we establish the convergence of the proposed solver on appropriate topologies, depending on the distribution of point cloud data and boundary type. We provide numerical results to validate the convergence results on various examples that involve simple geometry and an unknown manifold.</span>

                              <span>Abstract
A cross-product free (CPF) Jacobi–Davidson type method is proposed to compute a partial generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) of a large regular matrix pair 
                      
                      \(\{A,B\}\)
                      
                    , called CPF-JDGSVD. It implicitly solves the mathematically equivalent generalized eigenvalue problem of the cross-product matrix pair 
                      
                      \(\{A^TA,B^TB\}\)
                      
                     using the Rayleigh–Ritz projection method but does not form the cross-product matrices explicitly, and thus avoids the possible accuracy loss of the computed generalized singular values and generalized singular vectors. The method is an inner-outer iteration method, where the expansion of the right searching subspace forms the inner iterations that approximately solve the correction equations involved and the outer iterations extract approximate GSVD components with respect to the subspaces. A convergence result is established for the outer iterations, compact bounds are derived for the condition numbers of the correction equations, and the least solution accuracy requirements on the inner iterations are found, which can maximize the overall efficiency of CPF-JDGSVD as much as possible. Based on them, practical stopping criteria are designed for the inner iterations. A thick-restart CPF-JDGSVD algorithm with deflation and purgation is developed to compute several GSVD components of 
                      
                      \(\{A,B\}\)
                      
                     associated with the generalized singular values closest to a given target 
                      
                      \(\tau \)
                      
                    . Numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.</span>

This paper studies the eigenvalues of quaternion tensors and their applications. Firstly, we investigate the definitions and properties of the left and right eigenvalues of the quaternion tensors. Then we establish the quaternion tensor Lanczos method to calculate the eigenvalues and eigentensors of a Hermitian quaternion tensor and the principal component analysis for the quaternion tensor. Moreover, we present the k-means method for quaternion tensor and use it to color video clustering. Finally, we conducted experiments to prove the effectiveness of the proposed theory and algorithms.</span>

 Abstract. We consider the problem of determining the arrival statistics of unbiased planar random walkers to complex target configurations. In contrast to problems posed in finite domains, simple moments of the first passage time distribution, such as its mean and variance, are not defined. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain the full arrival statistics. We describe several methods to obtain these distributions and other associated quantities such as splitting probabilities. One approach combines a Laplace transform of the underlying parabolic equation with matched asymptotic analysis followed by numerical transform inversion. The second approach is similar but uses a boundary integral equation method to solve for the transformed variable. To validate the results of this theory, and to obtain the arrival time statistics in very general configurations of absorbers, we introduce an efficient kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method that describes trajectories as a combination of large but exactly solvable projection steps. The effectiveness of these methodologies is demonstrated on a variety of challenging examples highlighting the applicability of these methods to a variety of practical scenarios, such as source inference. A particularly useful finding arising from these results is that homogenization theories, in which complex configurations are replaced by equivalent simple ones, are remarkably effective at describing arrival time statistics.</span>

 Abstract. Wolbachia is a natural bacterium that can infect mosquitoes and reduce their ability to transmit mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, Zika, and chikungunya. Field trials and modeling studies have shown that the fraction of infection among the mosquitoes must exceed a threshold level for the infection to persist. To capture this threshold, it is critical to consider the spatial heterogeneity in the distributions of the infected and uninfected mosquitoes created by a local release of the infected mosquitoes. We develop and analyze PDE models to study the invasion dynamics of Wolbachia infection among mosquitoes in the field. Our reaction-diffusion-type models account for the complex vertical transmission and the spatial mosquito dispersion. We characterize the threshold for a successful invasion with a bubble-shaped distribution, called the “critical bubble.” The critical bubble is optimal in its release size compared to other spatial profiles in a one-dimensional landscape. The fraction of infection near the release center is higher than the threshold level for the corresponding homogeneously mixing ODE models. We show that the proposed spatial models give rise to the traveling waves of Wolbachia infection when above the threshold. We quantify how the threshold condition and traveling-wave velocity depend on the diffusion coefficients and other model parameters. Numerical studies for different scenarios are presented to inform the design of release strategies.</span>

 Abstract. Global dynamics of a Filippov susceptible, infectious, quarantine, and recovered model subject to delayed relay control are investigated in this work. The global stability of equilibria is obtained by means of the generalized Lyapunov method. In addition, combining the Poincaré maps, the displacement function, and a Melnikov-like method, we derive some sufficient conditions to ensure the existence, uniqueness, and global stability of a slowly oscillating periodic solution. Numerical simulations are performed to explore the effectiveness of the quarantine control measure and the effects of the delay.</span>
