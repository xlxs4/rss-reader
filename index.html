                              <span>Predicting the dynamics of mutation spread in engineered cell populations is a sought-after goal in synthetic biology. Until now, models that capture these processes have been lacking, either by failing to account for the diversity of mutation types, or by failing to link the growth rate of a cell to the consumption of shared cellular resources by synthetic constructs. In this study we address these shortcomings by building a novel mutation-aware modelling framework of cell growth in a turbidostat. Our framework allows users to input essential design elements of their synthetic constructs so as to predict the time evolution of different mutation phenotypes and protein production dynamics. Its structure allows quick mutation-based analysis of any construct design, from single-gene constructs to multi-gene devices with regulatory elements. We show how our framework can generate new insights into industrial applications, such as how the design of synthetic constructs impacts long-term protein yield and genetic shelf-life. Our framework also uncovers new mutation-driven design paradigms for synthetic gene regulatory networks, such as how mutations can temporarily increase the bistability of toggle switches, or how repressilators can be resistant to single points of failure.</span>

                              <span>Speed is key during infectious disease outbreaks. It is essential, for example, to identify critical host binding factors to the pathogens as fast as possible. The complexity of host plasma membrane is often a limiting factor hindering fast and accurate determination of host binding factors as well as high-throughput screening for neutralizing antimicrobial drug targets. Here we describe a multi-parametric and high-throughput platform tackling this bottleneck and enabling fast screens for host binding factors as well as new antiviral drug targets. The sensitivity and robustness of our platform was validated by blocking SARS-CoV-2 spike particles with nanobodies and IgGs from human serum samples.

TeaserA fast screening platform tackling host-pathogen interactions.</span>

                              <span>Cells self-organize molecules in space and time to generate complex behaviors, but we lack synthetic strategies for engineering spatiotemporal signaling. We present a programmable reaction-diffusion platform for designing protein oscillations, patterns, and circuits in mammalian cells using two bacterial proteins, MinD and MinE (MinDE). MinDE circuits act like &quot;single-cell radios&quot;, emitting frequency-barcoded fluorescence signals that can be spectrally isolated and analyzed using digital signal processing tools. We define how to genetically program these signals and modulate their dynamics using engineerable protein-protein interactions. By connecting MinDE to endogenous cellular pathways, we built circuits that broadcast frequency-barcoded single-cell kinase activity or that synthetically pattern actin polymerization. Our work establishes a new paradigm for probing and engineering cellular activities at length and timescales critical for biological function.</span>

                              <span>High-throughput transcriptomics has revolutionised the field of transcriptome research by offering a cost-effective and powerful screening tool. Standard bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) enables characterisation of the average expression profiles for individual samples and facilitates identification of the molecular functions associated with genes differentially expressed across conditions. RNA-Seq can also be applied to disentangle splicing variants and discover novel transcripts, thus contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptome landscape. A closely related technique, single-cell RNA-Seq, has enabled the study of cell-type-specific gene expressions in hundreds to thousands of cells, aiding the exploration of cell heterogeneity. Nowadays, bulk RNA-Seq and single-cell RNA-Seq serve as complementary tools to advance and accelerate the development of transcriptome-based resources. This Collection illustrates how the current global research community makes use of these techniques to address a broad range of questions in life sciences. It demonstrates the usefulness and popularity of high-throughput transcriptomics and presents the best practices and potential issues for the benefit of future end-users.</span>

This article studies the asymptotic profiles of coexistence endemic equilibrium solutions of a two-strain reaction-diffusion epidemic model with mass-action incidence when the diffusion rates are sufficiently small. We address the question of how the population size and environmental heterogeneity impact the persistence and extinction of the disease when the diffusion rates approach zero. In particular, we show that there is a sharp critical number which depends delicately on the infected groups’ diffusion rates and each strain’s spatially heterogeneous infection and recovery rates. Moreover, if the total size of the population is kept below this critical number, then the disease could be eradicated by restricting the susceptible hosts’ movement . However, if the total population exceeds this critical number, the disease may persist no matter how the movement of the susceptible hosts is controlled. Additionally, our results suggest that the disease may persist if the diffusion rates of the infected groups are kept sufficiently smaller than that of the susceptible group.</span>

                              <span>Enzyme spatial organisation and compartmentalisation are naturally evolved mechanisms for facilitating multi-step biocatalysis. We explored the synthetic in vivo co-encapsulation of two different cargo proteins in yeast using a self-assembling virus-like particle. Co-encapsulation was verified using single particle techniques for both end-to-end fusion of the cargo proteins with the encapsulation anchor at one end, and coexpression of each cargo protein with their individual anchors. The co-encapsulation of a bifunctional geranyl diphosphate/farnesyl diphosphate synthase and a bifunctional linalool/nerolidol synthase delivered nerolidol titres up to 30 times that of an unorganised  free enzyme control, a remarkable improvement from a single engineering step. Interestingly, striking differences in the ratio of products (linalool and nerolidol) were observed with each spatial organisation approach. This work presents the largest reported titre fold increases from in vivo enzyme compartmentalisation and suggests that enzyme spatial organisation could be used to modulate the product profile of promiscuous enzymes.</span>

The emergence and persistence of polymorphism within populations generally requires specific regimes of natural or sexual selection. Here, we develop a unified theoretical framework to explore how polymorphism at targeted loci can be generated and maintained by either disassortative mating choice or balancing selection due to, for example, heterozygote advantage. To this aim, we model the dynamics of alleles at a single locus A in a population of haploid individuals, where reproductive success depends on the combination of alleles carried by the parents at locus A. Our theoretical study of the model confirms that the conditions for the persistence of a given level of allelic polymorphism depend on the relative reproductive advantages among pairs of individuals. Interestingly, equilibria with unbalanced allelic frequencies were shown to emerge from successive introduction of mutants. We then investigate the role of the function linking allelic divergence to reproductive advantage on the evolutionary fate of alleles within the population. Our results highlight the significance of the shape of this function for both the number of alleles maintained and their level of genetic divergence. Large number of alleles are maintained with substantial replacement of alleles, when disassortative advantage slowly increases with allelic differentiation . In contrast, few highly differentiated alleles are predicted to be maintained when genetic differentiation has a strong effect on disassortative advantage. These opposite effects predicted by our model explain how disassortative mate choice may lead to various levels of allelic differentiation and polymorphism, and shed light on the effect of mate preferences on the persistence of balanced and unbalanced polymorphism in natural population.</span>

Cancer is usually considered a genetic disease caused by alterations in genes that control cellular behaviors, especially growth and division. Cancer cells differ from normal tissue cells in many ways that allow them to grow out of control and become invasive. However, experiments have shown that aberrant growth in many tissues burdened with varying numbers of mutant cells can be corrected, and wild-type cells are required for the active elimination of mutant cells. These findings reveal the dynamic cellular behaviors that lead to a tissue homeostatic state when faced with mutational and nonmutational insults. The current study was motivated by these observations and established a mathematical model of how a tissue copes with the aberrant behavior of mutant cells. The proposed model depicts the interaction between wild-type and mutant cells through a system of two delay differential equations, which include the random mutation of normal cells and the active extrusion of mutant cells. Based on the proposed model, we performed qualitative analysis to identify the conditions of either normal tissue homeostasis or uncontrolled growth with varying numbers of abnormal mutant cells. Bifurcation analysis suggests the conditions of bistability with either a small or large number of mutant cells, the coexistence of bistable steady states can be clinically beneficial by driving the state of mutant cell predominance to the attraction basin of the state with a low number of mutant cells. This result is further confirmed by the treatment strategy obtained from optimal control theory.</span>

Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve fibers has always been an attractive field of research. Due to the higher activation threshold, the stimulation of small fibers is accompanied by the stimulation of larger ones. It is therefore necessary to design a specific stimulation theme in order to only activate narrow fibers. There is evidence that stimulating Aδ fibers can activate endogenous pain-relieving mechanisms. However, both selective stimulation and reducing pain by activating small nociceptive fibers are still poorly investigated. In this study, using high-frequency stimulation waveforms (5–20 kHz), computational modeling provides a simple framework for activating narrow nociceptive fibers. Additionally, a model of myelinated nerve fibers is modified by including sodium–potassium pump and investigating its effects on neuronal stimulation. Besides, a modified mathematical model of pain processing circuits in the dorsal horn is presented that consists of supraspinal pain control mechanisms. Hence, by employing this pain-modulating model, the mechanism of the reduction of pain by activating nociceptive fibers is explored. In the case of two fibers with the same distance from the point source electrode, a single stimulation waveform is capable of blocking one large fiber and stimulating another small fiber. Noteworthy, the Na/K pump model demonstrated that it does not have a significant effect on the activation threshold and firing frequency of fiber. Ultimately, results suggest that the descending pathways of Locus coeruleus may effectively contribute to pain relief through stimulation of nociceptive fibers, which will be beneficial for clinical interventions.</span>

We propose and analyze numerical schemes for the gradient flow of Q-tensor with the quasi-entropy. The quasi-entropy is a strictly convex, rotationally invariant elementary function, giving a singular potential constraining the eigenvalues of Q within the physical range 
                      
                      \((-1/3,2/3)\)
                      
                    . Compared with the potential derived from the Bingham distribution, the quasi-entropy has the same asymptotic behavior and underlying physics. Meanwhile, it is very easy to evaluate because of its simple expression. For the elastic energy, we include all the rotationally invariant terms. The numerical schemes for the gradient flow are built on the nice properties of the quasi-entropy. The first-order time discretization is uniquely solvable, keeping the physical constraints and energy dissipation, which are all independent of the time step. The second-order time discretization keeps the first two properties unconditionally, and the third with an O(1) restriction on the time step. These results also hold when we further incorporate a second-order discretization in space. Error estimates are also established for time discretization and full discretization. Numerical examples about defect patterns are presented to validate the theoretical results.</span>

                              <span>Synthetic biology holds immense promise to tackle key problems we are facing, for instance in resource use, environmental health, and human health care. However, comprehensive safety measures are needed to deploy genetically engineered microorganisms in open-environment applications. Here, we describe a genetic biocontainment system based on conditional stability of essential proteins. We used a yeast-adapted destabilizing domain degron, which can be stabilized by estradiol addition (ERdd). Leveraging the yeast GFP collection and lab automation platforms, we ERdd-tagged 775 essential genes and screened for strains with estradiol dependent growth. Three genes, SPC110, DIS3 and RRP46, were found to be particularly suitable. Respective strains showed no growth defect in the presence of estradiol and strong growth inhibition in its absence. Of these, SPC110-ERdd offered the most stringent containment, with an escape frequency of 7.0x10-8, and full growth restoration at 100 nM estradiol. By systematically analysing the containment escapees, we identified the non-essential C-terminal region of SPC110 as target for escape mutations. Its removal decreased the escape frequency with a single ERdd tag further to 4.3x10-9. Combining SPC110-ERdd with a second ERdd tag on either DIS3 or RRP46 resulted in escape frequencies below the detection limit of the used assay (&lt;2x10-10). Being based on conditional protein stability, this approach is mechanistically orthogonal to previously reported intrinsic biocontainment systems. It thus can be readily combined with other systems, for instance ones based on transcriptional or translational control of essential gene expression, to achieve multiplexed, extremely stringent control over the survival of engineered organisms.</span>

                              <span>Although gene synthesis efficiency has improved through the years, current methods offered by DNA synthesis vendors are limited when it comes to repetitive sequences. Here, we describe a method for the enzymatic assembly of repetitive small synthetic genes. The method involves an initial step where the gene of interest is split in silico into small synthons of up to 80 base pairs flanked by Golden Gate-compatible four-base pair overhangs. Synthons are enzymatically synthesized by oligo extension and then assembled into the synthetic gene by Golden Gate Assembly. We construct eight different synthetic genes ranging from 133 to 456 base pairs encoding RNA structures with repetitive elements that are challenging to synthesize. We report assembly fidelities of up to 87.5 % that decrease for increasing number of synthons. This method is envisioned as an important addition to the molecular cloning toolbox and especially useful for construction of challenging and repetitive genes.</span>

                              <span>Amino acids have a multi-billion-dollar market with rising demand, prompting the development of high-performance microbial factories. However, a general screening strategy applicable to all proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids is still lacking. Modification of the critical structure of tRNA could decrease the aminoacylation level of tRNA catalyzed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Involved in a two-substrate sequential reaction, amino acids with increased concentration could elevate the reduced aminoacylation rate caused by specific tRNA modification. Here, we developed a selection system for overproducers of specific amino acids using corresponding engineered tRNAs and reporter genes. As a proof-of-concept, overproducers of five amino acids such as L-tryptophan were screened out by growth-based and/or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based screening from random mutation libraries of Escherichia coli and Corynebacterium glutamicum, respectively. This study provided a universal strategy that could be applied to screen overproducers of proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids in amber-stop-codon-recoded or non-recoded hosts.</span>

                              <span>The RNA recognition motif (RRM) is the most common RNA-binding protein domain identified in nature. However, RRM-containing proteins are only prevalent in eukaryotic phyla, in which they play central regulatory roles. Here, we engineered an orthogonal post-transcriptional control system of gene expression in the bacterium Escherichia coli with the mammalian RNA-binding protein Musashi-1, which is a stem cell marker with neurodevelopmental role that contains two canonical RRMs. In the circuit, Musashi-1 is regulated transcriptionally and works as an allosteric translation repressor thanks to a specific interaction with the leader coding region of a messenger RNA and its structural plasticity to respond to fatty acids. We fully characterized the genetic system at the population and single-cell levels showing a significant fold change in reporter expression, and the underlying molecular mechanism by assessing the in vitro binding kinetics and in vivo functionality of a series of RNA mutants. Moreover, the dynamic response of the system was well recapitulated by a bottom-up mathematical model. This work illustrates how RRM-based regulation can be adapted to simple organisms, thereby paving the way for engineering more complex circuits in prokaryotes by combining transcription and translation control with proteins.</span>

                              <span>Transcriptional terminators are key players in the flow of genetic information, but are often overlooked in circuit design. In this work, we used the Standard European Vector Architecture (SEVA) as a scaffold to investigate the effects of different terminators in the output of a reporter construct expressed in two bacterial species and found that replacing the conventional T1 and T0 transcriptional terminators of the SEVA vector format with a set of broad-host metagenomic terminators resulted in a significant improvement in the signal of a fluorescent device in Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Interestingly, this new vector design displayed the same performance as pSEVA231 in Escherichia coli DH10B. Our results support the notion that transcriptional terminators may affect the interconnected mesh of biological processes taking place in gene expression, leading to a host-dependent output that should be heeded for optimal circuit expression in different microbial hosts.</span>

The shape of cells and the control thereof plays a central role in a variety of cellular processes, including endo- and exocytosis, cell division and cell movement. Intra- and extracellular forces control the shapes, and while the shape changes in some processes such as exocytosis are intracellularly-controlled and localized in the cell, movement requires force transmission to the environment, and the feedback from it can affect the cell shape and mode of movement used. The shape of a cell is determined by its cytoskeleton (CSK), and thus shape changes involved in various processes involve controlled remodeling of the CSK. While much is known about individual components involved in these processes, an integrated understanding of how intra- and extracellular signals are coupled to the control of the mechanical changes involved is not at hand for any of them. As a first step toward understanding the interaction between intracellular forces imposed on the membrane and cell shape, we investigate the role of distributed surrogates for cortical forces in producing the observed three-dimensional shapes. We show how different balances of applied forces lead to such shapes, that there are different routes to the same end state, and that state transitions between axisymmetric shapes need not all be axisymmetric. Examples of the force distributions that lead to protrusions are given, and the shape changes induced by adhesion of a cell to a surface are studied. The results provide a reference framework for developing detailed models of intracellular force distributions observed experimentally, and provide a basis for studying how movement of a cell in a tissue or fluid is influenced by its shape.</span>

 Abstract. We investigate the local equilibrium (LE) distribution of a crystal surface jump process as it approaches its hydrodynamic (continuum) limit in a nonstandard scaling regime introduced by Marzuola and Weare. The atypical scaling leads to a local equilibrium state whose structure is novel to the best of our knowledge. The distinguishing characteristic of the new, rough LE state is that the ensemble average of single lattice site observables do not vary smoothly across lattice sites. We investigate numerically and analytically how the rough LE state affects the convergence mechanism via three key limits, and we show that by comparison more standard, “smooth” LE states satisfy stronger versions of these limits.</span>

This study investigates the use of covariant Lyapunov vectors and their respective angles for detecting transitions between metastable states in dynamical systems, as recently discussed in several atmospheric sciences applications. In a first step, the needed underlying dynamical models are derived from data using a non-parametric model-based clustering framework. The covariant Lyapunov vectors are then approximated based on these data-driven models. The data-based numerical approach is tested using three well-understood example systems with increasing dynamical complexity, identifying properties that allow for a successful application of the method: in particular, the method is identified to require a clear multiple time scale structure with fast transitions between slow subsystems. The latter slow dynamics should be dynamically characterized by invariant neutral directions of the linear approximation model.</span>

In this work, we show that a finite-time recurrence analysis of different chaotic trajectories in two-dimensional non-linear Hamiltonian systems provides useful prior knowledge of their dynamical behavior. By defining an ensemble of initial conditions, evolving them until a given maximum iteration time, and computing the recurrence rate of each orbit, it is possible to find particular trajectories that widely differ from the average behavior. We show that orbits with high recurrence rates are the ones that experience stickiness, being dynamically trapped in specific regions of the phase space. We analyze three different non-linear maps and present our numerical observations considering particular features in each of them. We propose the described approach as a method to visually illustrate and characterize regions in phase space with distinct dynamical behaviors.</span>

Although such synonymous codons do not alter the encoded amino acid sequence, their selection can dramatically affect the expression of the resulting protein. Codon optimization of synthetic DNA sequences is important for heterologous expression. However, existing solutions are primarily based on choosing high-frequency codons only, neglecting the important effects of rare codons. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent-neural-network based codon optimization tool, ICOR, that aims to learn codon usage bias on a genomic dataset of Escherichia coli. We compile a dataset of over 7,000 non-redundant, high-expression, robust genes which are use…</span>

The Sackin and Colless indices are two widely-used metrics for measuring the balance of trees and for testing evolutionary models in phylogenetics. This short paper contributes two results about the Sackin and Colless indices of trees. One result is the asymptotic analysis of the expected Sackin and Colless indices of tree shapes (which are full binary rooted unlabelled trees) under the uniform model where tree shapes are sampled with equal probability. Another is a short direct proof of the closed formula for the expected Sackin index of phylogenetic trees (which are full binary rooted trees with leaves being labelled with taxa) under the uniform model.</span>

Various environmental alterations resulting from the current global change compromise the persistence of species in their habitual environment. To cope with the obvious risk of extinction, plastic responses provide organisms with rapid acclimatization to new environments. The premise of plastic rescue has been theoretically studied from mathematical models in both deterministic and stochastic environments, focusing on analyzing the persistence and stability of the populations. Here, we evaluate this premise in the framework of a consumer-resource interaction considering the energy investment towards reproduction vs. maintenance as a plastic trait according to positive/negative variation of the available resource. A basic consumer-resource mathematical model is formulated based on the principle of biomass conversion that incorporates the energy allocation toward vital functions of the life-cycle of consumer individuals. Our mathematical approach is based on the impulsive differential equations at fixed moments considering two impulsive effects associated with the instants at which consumers obtain environmental information and when energy allocation strategy change occurs. From a preliminary analysis of the non-plastic temporal dynamics, namely when the energy allocation is constant over time and without experiencing changes concerning the variation of resources, both the persistence and stability of the consumer-resource dynamic are dependent on the energy allocation strategies belonging to a set termed stability range. We found that the plastic energy allocation can promote a stable dynamical pattern in the consumer-resource interaction depending on both the magnitude of the energy allocation change and the time lag between environmental sensibility instants and when the expression of the plastic trait occurs.</span>

For example, in physical systems, the Allen–Cahn equation describes pattern formation associated to phase transitions. In finance, instead, the Black–Scholes equation describes the evolution of the price of derivative investment instruments. Such modern applications often require to solve these equations in high-dimensional regimes in which classical approaches are ineffective. Recently, an interesting new approach based on deep learning has been introduced byby E, Han and Jentzen [1, 2]. The main idea is to construct a deep network which is trained from the samples of discrete stochastic differential equations underlying Kolmogorov’s equation. The network is able to approximate, numerically at least, the solutions of the Kolmogorov equation with polynomial complexity in whole spatial domains. In this contribution we study variants of the deep networks by using different discretizations schemes of the stochastic differential equation. We compare the performance of the associated networks, on benchmarked examples, and show that, for some discretization schemes, improvements in the accuracy are possible without affecting the observed computational complexity.</span>

In this manuscript a POD-Galerkin based Reduced Order Model for unsteady Fluid-Structure Interaction problems is presented. The model is based on a partitioned algorithm, with semi-implicit treatment of the coupling conditions. A Chorin–Temam projection scheme is applied to the incompressible Navier–Stokes problem, and a Robin coupling condition is used for the coupling between the fluid and the solid. The coupled problem is based on an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation, and the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition procedure is used for the generation of the reduced basis. We extend existing works on a segregated Reduced Order Model for Fluid-Structure Interaction to unsteady problems that couple an incompressible, Newtonian fluid with a linear elastic solid, in two spatial dimensions. We consider three test cases to assess the overall capabilities of the method: an unsteady, non-parametrized problem, a problem that presents a geometrical parametrization of the solid domain, and finally, a problem where a parametrization of the solid’s shear modulus is taken into account.</span>

A method for the multifidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC) estimation of statistical quantities is proposed which is applicable to computational budgets of any size. Based on a sequence of optimization problems each with a globally minimizing closed-form solution, this method extends the usability of a well known MFMC algorithm, recovering it when the computational budget is large enough. Theoretical results verify that the proposed approach is at least as optimal as its namesake and retains the benefits of multifidelity estimation with minimal assumptions on the budget or amount of available data, providing a notable reduction in variance over simple Monte Carlo estimation.</span>

                              <span>Abstract
This is the third paper in a series in which we develop machine learning (ML) moment closure models for the radiative transfer equation. In our previous work (Huang et al. in J Comput Phys 453:110941, 2022), we proposed an approach to learn the gradient of the unclosed high order moment, which performs much better than learning the moment itself and the conventional 
                      
                      \(P_N\)
                      
                     closure. However, while the ML moment closure has better accuracy, it is not able to guarantee hyperbolicity and has issues with long time stability. In our second paper (Huang et al., in: Machine learning moment closure models for the radiative transfer equation II: enforcing global hyperbolicity in gradient based closures, 2021. arXiv:2105.14410), we identified a symmetrizer which leads to conditions that enforce that the gradient based ML closure is symmetrizable hyperbolic and stable over long time. The limitation of this approach is that in practice the highest moment can only be related to four, or fewer, lower moments. In this paper, we propose a new method to enforce the hyperbolicity of the ML closure model. Motivated by the observation that the coefficient matrix of the closure system is a lower Hessenberg matrix, we relate its eigenvalues to the roots of an associated polynomial. We design two new neural network architectures based on this relation. The ML closure model resulting from the first neural network is weakly hyperbolic and guarantees the physical characteristic speeds, i.e., the eigenvalues are bounded by the speed of light. The second model is strictly hyperbolic and does not guarantee the boundedness of the eigenvalues. Several benchmark tests including the Gaussian source problem and the two-material problem show the good accuracy, stability and generalizability of our hyperbolic ML closure model.</span>

The orthogonal decomposition factorizes a tensor into a sum of an orthogonal list of rank-one tensors. The corresponding rank is called orthogonal rank. We present several properties of orthogonal rank, which are different from those of tensor rank in many aspects. For instance, a subtensor may have a larger orthogonal rank than the whole tensor. To fit the orthogonal decomposition, we propose an algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian method. The gradient of the objective function has a nice structure, inspiring us to use gradient-based optimization methods to solve it. We guarantee the orthogonality by a novel orthogonalization process. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method has a great advantage over the existing methods for strongly orthogonal decompositions in terms of the approximation error.</span>

In this paper, we extend the class of kernel methods, the so-called diffusion maps (DM) and ghost point diffusion maps (GPDM), to solve the time-dependent advection-diffusion PDE on unknown smooth manifolds without and with boundaries. The core idea is to directly approximate the spatial components of the differential operator on the manifold with a local integral operator and combine it with the standard implicit time difference scheme. When the manifold has a boundary, a simplified version of the GPDM approach is used to overcome the bias of the integral approximation near the boundary. The Monte-Carlo discretization of the integral operator over the point cloud data gives rise to a mesh-free formulation that is natural for randomly distributed points, even when the manifold is embedded in high-dimensional ambient space. Here, we establish the convergence of the proposed solver on appropriate topologies, depending on the distribution of point cloud data and boundary type. We provide numerical results to validate the convergence results on various examples that involve simple geometry and an unknown manifold.</span>

A cross-product free (CPF) Jacobi–Davidson type method is proposed to compute a partial generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) of a large regular matrix pair 
                      
                      \(\{A,B\}\)
                      
                    , called CPF-JDGSVD. It implicitly solves the mathematically equivalent generalized eigenvalue problem of the cross-product matrix pair 
                      
                      \(\{A^TA,B^TB\}\)
                      
                     using the Rayleigh–Ritz projection method but does not form the cross-product matrices explicitly, and thus avoids the possible accuracy loss of the computed generalized singular values and generalized singular vectors. The method is an inner-outer iteration method, where the expansion of the right searching subspace forms the inner iterations that approximately solve the correction equations involved and the outer iterations extract approximate GSVD components with respect to the subspaces. A convergence result is established for the outer iterations, compact bounds are derived for the condition numbers of the correction equations, and the least solution accuracy requirements on the inner iterations are found, which can maximize the overall efficiency of CPF-JDGSVD as much as possible. Based on them, practical stopping criteria are designed for the inner iterations. A thick-restart CPF-JDGSVD algorithm with deflation and purgation is developed to compute several GSVD components of 
                      
                      \(\{A,B\}\)

In order to better study the interaction between epidemic propagation and information diffusion, a new coupling model on multiplex networks with time delay is put forward in this paper. One layer represents the information diffusion about epidemics. There is not only information about the positive prevention of infectious diseases but also negative preventive information. Meanwhile, the dissemination of information at this layer will be influenced by the mass media, which can convey positive and reliable preventive measures to help the public avoid exposure to contagion. The other layer represents the transmission of infectious diseases, and the public in this layer no longer only exchange information related to infectious diseases in the virtual social network like the information layer but spread infectious diseases through contact among people. The classical SIR model is used to model for epidemic propagation. Since each infected individual needs to spend enough time to recover, the infected one at one time does not necessarily change to the recovered one at the next time, so time delay is an essential factor to be considered in the model. Based on the microscopic Markov chain approach, this paper obtains an explicit expression for epidemic threshold in the two-layered multiplex networks with time delay, which reveals some main factors affecting epidemic threshold. In particular, the time delay has a noticeable effect on the epidemic threshold to some extent. Finally, the influence of these main factors on the epidemic threshold and their interaction are proved through numerical simulations.</span>

We study motion of dark solitons in a non-uniform one-dimensional flow of a Bose–Einstein condensate. Our approach is based on Hamiltonian mechanics applied to the particle-like behavior of dark solitons in a slightly non-uniform and slowly changing surrounding. In one-dimensional geometry, the condensate’s wave function undergoes the jump-like behavior across the soliton, and this leads to generation of the counterflow in the background condensate. For a correct description of soliton’s dynamics, the contributions of this counterflow to the momentum and energy of the soliton are taken into account. The resulting Hamilton equations are reduced to the Newton-like equation for the soliton’s path, and this Newton equation is solved in several typical situations. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical calculations.</span>

We employ a recently developed single-trajectory Lagrangian diagnostic tool, the trajectory rotation average [math], to visualize oceanic vortices (or eddies) from sparse drifter data. We apply the [math] to two drifter data sets that cover various oceanographic scales: the Grand Lagrangian Deployment and the Global Drifter Program. Based on the [math], we develop a general algorithm that extracts approximate eddy boundaries. We find that the [math] outperforms other available single-trajectory-based eddy detection methodologies on sparse drifter data and identifies eddies on scales that are unresolved by satellite-altimetry.</span>

This paper studies the eigenvalues of quaternion tensors and their applications. Firstly, we investigate the definitions and properties of the left and right eigenvalues of the quaternion tensors. Then we establish the quaternion tensor Lanczos method to calculate the eigenvalues and eigentensors of a Hermitian quaternion tensor and the principal component analysis for the quaternion tensor. Moreover, we present the k-means method for quaternion tensor and use it to color video clustering. Finally, we conducted experiments to prove the effectiveness of the proposed theory and algorithms.</span>

Many natural systems exhibit tipping points where changing environmental conditions spark a sudden shift to a new and sometimes quite different state. Global climate change is often associated with the stability of marine carbon stocks. We consider a stochastic carbonate system of the upper ocean to capture such transition phenomena. Based on the Onsager–Machlup action functional theory, we calculate the most probable transition pathway between the metastable and oscillatory states via a neural shooting method. Furthermore, we explore the effects of external random carbon input rates on the most probable transition pathway, which provides a basis to recognize naturally occurring tipping points. Particularly, we investigate the transition pathway’s dependence on the transition time and further compute the optimal transition time using a physics-informed neural network, toward the maximum carbonate concentration state in the oscillatory regimes. This work may offer some insights into the effects of noise-affected carbon input rates on transition phenomena in stochastic models.</span>

A statistical indicator for dynamic stability, known as the [math] indicator, is used to gauge the stability and, hence, detect approaching tipping points of simulation data from a reduced five-box model of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) exposed to a time-dependent hosing function. The hosing function simulates the influx of fresh water due to the melting of the Greenland ice sheet and increased precipitation in the North Atlantic. The [math] indicator is designed to detect changes in the memory properties of the dynamics and is based on fitting auto-regressive moving-average models in a sliding window approach to time series data. An increase in memory properties is interpreted as a sign of dynamical instability. The performance of the indicator is tested on time series subject to different types of tipping, namely, bifurcation-induced, noise-induced, and rate-induced tipping. The numerical analysis shows that the indicator indeed responds to the different types of induced instabilities. Finally, the indicator is applied to two AMOC time series from a full complexity Earth systems model (CESM2). Compared with the doubling [math] scenario, the quadrupling [math] scenario results in stronger dynamical instability of the AMOC during its weakening phase.</span>

We consider a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators in which the interaction is modulated by a measure of the similarity between the oscillators. Such a coupling is common in treating spatially mobile dynamical systems where the interaction is distance dependent or in resonance-enhanced interactions, for instance. For a system of Stuart–Landau oscillators coupled in this manner, we observe a novel route to oscillation death via a Hopf bifurcation. The individual oscillators are confined to inhomogeneous limit cycles initially and are damped to different fixed points after the bifurcation. Analytical and numerical results are presented for this case, while numerical results are presented for coupled Rössler and Sprott oscillators.</span>

 Abstract. We consider the problem of determining the arrival statistics of unbiased planar random walkers to complex target configurations. In contrast to problems posed in finite domains, simple moments of the first passage time distribution, such as its mean and variance, are not defined. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain the full arrival statistics. We describe several methods to obtain these distributions and other associated quantities such as splitting probabilities. One approach combines a Laplace transform of the underlying parabolic equation with matched asymptotic analysis followed by numerical transform inversion. The second approach is similar but uses a boundary integral equation method to solve for the transformed variable. To validate the results of this theory, and to obtain the arrival time statistics in very general configurations of absorbers, we introduce an efficient kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method that describes trajectories as a combination of large but exactly solvable projection steps. The effectiveness of these methodologies is demonstrated on a variety of challenging examples highlighting the applicability of these methods to a variety of practical scenarios, such as source inference. A particularly useful finding arising from these results is that homogenization theories, in which complex configurations are replaced by equivalent simple ones, are remarkably effective at describing arrival time statistics.</span>

 Abstract. Wolbachia is a natural bacterium that can infect mosquitoes and reduce their ability to transmit mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, Zika, and chikungunya. Field trials and modeling studies have shown that the fraction of infection among the mosquitoes must exceed a threshold level for the infection to persist. To capture this threshold, it is critical to consider the spatial heterogeneity in the distributions of the infected and uninfected mosquitoes created by a local release of the infected mosquitoes. We develop and analyze PDE models to study the invasion dynamics of Wolbachia infection among mosquitoes in the field. Our reaction-diffusion-type models account for the complex vertical transmission and the spatial mosquito dispersion. We characterize the threshold for a successful invasion with a bubble-shaped distribution, called the “critical bubble.” The critical bubble is optimal in its release size compared to other spatial profiles in a one-dimensional landscape. The fraction of infection near the release center is higher than the threshold level for the corresponding homogeneously mixing ODE models. We show that the proposed spatial models give rise to the traveling waves of Wolbachia infection when above the threshold. We quantify how the threshold condition and traveling-wave velocity depend on the diffusion coefficients and other model parameters. Numerical studies for different scenarios are presented to inform the design of release strategies.</span>

 Abstract. Global dynamics of a Filippov susceptible, infectious, quarantine, and recovered model subject to delayed relay control are investigated in this work. The global stability of equilibria is obtained by means of the generalized Lyapunov method. In addition, combining the Poincaré maps, the displacement function, and a Melnikov-like method, we derive some sufficient conditions to ensure the existence, uniqueness, and global stability of a slowly oscillating periodic solution. Numerical simulations are performed to explore the effectiveness of the quarantine control measure and the effects of the delay.</span>

Considering a system combining two generalized Boolean transformations, we found that depending on the parameters, we can generate generalized synchronization such that the two chaotic orbits have arbitrary proportional linear relations. We rigorously determined its synchronization conditions by the explicit computing conditional Lyapunov exponent using the ergodic property and stable property of the Cauchy distribution. We found that a phenomenon similar to chaotic synchronization occurs even when the synchronization conditions are not strictly satisfied, which exhibits some degree of structural stability of chaotic synchronization. Our model can be further extended to systems with more degrees of freedom and, in the future, can be applied to reservoir computing.</span>

Though synchronization of complex dynamical systems has been widely studied in the past few decades, few studies pay attention to the impact of network parameters on synchronization in hypernetworks. In this paper, we focus on a specific hypernetwork model consisting of coupled Rössler oscillators and investigate the impact of inner-coupling and time delay on the synchronized region (SR). For the sake of simplicity, the inner-coupling matrix is chosen from three typical forms, which result in classical bounded, unbounded, and empty SR in a single-layer network, respectively. The impact of inner-couplings or time delays on unbounded SR is the most interesting one among the three types of SR. Once the SR of one subnetwork is unbounded, the SR of the whole hypernetwork is also unbounded with a different inner-coupling matrix. In a hypernetwork with unbounded SR, the time delays change not only the size but also the type of SR. In a hypernetwork with bounded or empty SR, the time delays have almost no effect on the type of SR.</span>

Homeostasis represents the idea that a feature may remain invariant despite changes in some external parameters. We establish a connection between homeostasis and injectivity for reaction network models. In particular, we show that a reaction network cannot exhibit homeostasis if a modified version of the network (which we call homeostasis-associated network) is injective. We provide examples of reaction networks which can or cannot exhibit homeostasis by analyzing the injectivity of their homeostasis-associated networks.</span>

This paper derives a non-linear diffusion equation discussing two possible applications: the ionic diffusion in glasses and temperature-dependent conductivity in semiconductors. The first equation is a logarithmic diffusion derived formally from the continuity of ion concentration, but the latter is a more phenomenological example. A power-law ansatz with time-dependent parameters maximizes a non-standard entropy and gives a set of coupled motion equations we can solve analytically. These results build the general solution to the non-linear diffusion equation.</span>

Systems consisting of confined, interacting particles doing overdamped motion admit an effective description in terms of nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations. The behavior of these systems is closely related to the [math] power-law entropies and can be interpreted in terms of the [math]-based thermostatistics. The connection between overdamped systems and the [math] measures provides valuable insights on diverse physical problems, such as the dynamics of interacting vortices in type-II superconductors. The [math]-thermostatistical approach to the study of many-body systems described by nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations has been intensively explored in recent years, but most of these efforts were restricted to systems affected by time-independent external potentials. Here, we extend this treatment to systems evolving under time-dependent external forces. We establish a lower bound on the work done by these forces when they drive the system during a transformation. The bound is expressed in terms of a free energy based on the [math] entropy and is satisfied even if the driving forces are not derivable from a potential function. It constitutes a generalization, for systems governed by nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations involving general time-dependent external forces, of the [math]-theorem satisfied by these systems when the external forces arise from a time-independent potential.</span>

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) interacts with the immune cells within the human body, where the environment is uncertain and noisy. Stochastic models can successfully encapsulate the effect of such a noisy environment compared to their deterministic counterparts. The human immune system is complex but well-coordinated with various immune cells like [math]T cells, dendritic cells, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) cells, among many others. The CTL can kill the antigenic cells after its recognition. However, the efficacy of CTL in removing the infected [math]T cells is progressively compromised in HIV-infected individuals. This paper considers a noise-induced HIV-immune cell interaction model with immune impairment. A multiplicative white noise is introduced in the infection rate parameter to represent the fluctuations around the average value of the rate parameter as a causative effect of the noise. We analyzed the deterministic and stochastic models and prescribed sufficient conditions for infection eradication and persistence. It is determined under what parametric restrictions the asymptotic solutions of the noise-induced system will be a limiting case of the deterministic solutions. Simulation results revealed that the solutions of the deterministic system either converge to a CTL-dominated interior equilibrium or a CTL-free immunodeficient equilibrium, depending on the initial values of the system. Stochastic analysis divulged that higher noise might be helpful in the infection removal process. The extinction time of infected [math]T cells for some fixed immune impairment gradually decreases with increasing noise intensity and follows the power law.</span>

Coupled Boussinesq equations are used to describe long weakly nonlinear longitudinal strain waves in a bi-layer with soft bonding between the layers (e.g., a soft adhesive). From a mathematical viewpoint, a particularly difficult case appears when the linear long-wave speeds in the layers are significantly different (high-contrast case). The traditional derivation of the uni-directional models leads to four uncoupled Ostrovsky equations for the right- and left-propagating waves in each layer. However, the models impose a “zero-mass constraint”; i.e., the initial conditions should necessarily have zero mean, restricting the applicability of that description. Here, we bypass the contradiction in this high-contrast case by constructing the solution for the deviation from the evolving mean value, using asymptotic multiple-scale expansions involving two pairs of fast characteristic variables and two slow time variables. By construction, the Ostrovsky equations emerging within the scope of this derivation are solved for initial conditions with zero mean, while initial conditions for the original system may have non-zero mean values. Asymptotic validity of the solution is carefully examined numerically. We apply the models to the description of counter-propagating waves generated by solitary wave initial conditions, or co-propagating waves generated by cnoidal wave initial conditions, as well as the resulting wave interactions, and contrast with the behavior of the waves in bi-layers when the linear long-wave speeds in the layers are close (low-contrast case). One local (classical) and two non-local (generalized) conservation laws of the coupled Boussinesq equations for strains are derived and used to control the accuracy of the numerical simulations.</span>

Consider a large ecosystem (foodweb) with n species, where the abundances follow a Lotka–Volterra system of coupled differential equations. We assume that each species interacts with

                     other species and that their interaction coefficients are independent random variables. This parameter d reflects the connectance of the foodweb and the sparsity of its interactions especially if d is much smaller that n. We address the question of feasibility of the foodweb, that is the existence of an equilibrium solution of the Lotka-Volterra system with no vanishing species. We establish that for a given range of d, namely 
                      
                      \(d\propto n\)

In this work, the error splitting technique combined with cut-off function method is designed to derive unconditionally optimal error estimates for a fully implicit conservative numerical method of the N-coupled nonlinear Schrödinger–Boussinesq equations, which is constructed by an implicit Crank–Nicolson-type method in time and new nonconforming virtual element methods in space. The numerical scheme is conservative in the senses of discrete mass and energy, and the cut-off error splitting technique is innovative to remove the standard time-step conditions 
                      
                      \(\tau &#x3D;o(h^{d/4})\)
                      
                     and 
                      
                      \(\tau &#x3D;o(h^{d/2})\)
                      
                    . Finally, several numerical examples are given to confirm our theoretical results. The analytical technique in this work could be used to study other implicit numerical methods of nonlinear physical models, including but not limited to conforming and nonconforming finite element methods/virtual element methods.</span>

We propose an approach to modeling large-scale multi-agent dynamical systems allowing interactions among more than just pairs of agents using the theory of mean field games and the notion of hypergraphons, which are obtained as limits of large hypergraphs. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work on mean field games on hypergraphs. Together with an extension to a multi-layer setup, we obtain limiting descriptions for large systems of non-linear, weakly interacting dynamical agents. On the theoretical side, we prove the well-foundedness of the resulting hypergraphon mean field game, showing both existence and approximate Nash properties. On the applied side, we extend numerical and learning algorithms to compute the hypergraphon mean field equilibria. To verify our approach empirically, we consider a social rumor spreading model, where we give agents intrinsic motivation to spread rumors to unaware agents, and an epidemic control problem.</span>

Chaotic time series have been captured by reservoir computing models composed of a recurrent neural network whose output weights are trained in a supervised manner. These models, however, are typically limited to randomly connected networks of homogeneous units. Here, we propose a new class of structured reservoir models that incorporates a diversity of cell types and their known connections. In a first version of the model, the reservoir was composed of mean-rate units separated into pyramidal, parvalbumin, and somatostatin cells. Stability analysis of this model revealed two distinct dynamical regimes, namely, (i) an inhibition-stabilized network (ISN) where strong recurrent excitation is balanced by strong inhibition and (ii) a non-ISN network with weak excitation. These results were extended to a leaky integrate-and-fire model that captured different cell types along with their network architecture. ISN and non-ISN reservoir networks were trained to relay and generate a chaotic Lorenz attractor. Despite their increased performance, ISN networks operate in a regime of activity near the limits of stability where external perturbations yield a rapid divergence in output. The proposed framework of structured reservoir computing opens avenues for exploring how neural microcircuits can balance performance and stability when representing time series through distinct dynamical regimes.</span>

Doxorubicin is a chemotherapy widely used to treat several types of cancer, including triple-negative breast cancer. In this work, we use a Bayesian framework to rigorously assess the ability of ten different mathematical models to describe the dynamics of four TNBC cell lines (SUM-149PT, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, and MDA-MB-468) in response to treatment with doxorubicin at concentrations ranging from 10 to 2500 nM. Each cell line was plated and serially imaged via fluorescence microscopy for 30 days following 6, 12, or 24 h of in vitro drug exposure. We use the resulting data sets to estimate the parameters of the ten pharmacodynamic models using a Bayesian approach, which accounts for uncertainties in the models, parameters, and observational data. The ten candidate models describe the growth patterns and degree of response to doxorubicin for each cell line by incorporating exponential or logistic tumor growth, and distinct forms of cell death. Cell line and treatment specific model parameters are then estimated from the experimental data for each model. We analyze all competing models using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and the selection of the best model is made according to the model probabilities (BIC weights). We show that the best model among the candidate set of models depends on the TNBC cell line and the treatment scenario, though, in most cases, there is great uncertainty in choosing the best model. However, we show that the probability of being the best model can be increased by combining treatment data with the same total drug exposure. Our analysis points to the importance of considering multiple models, built on different biological assumptions, to capture the observed variations in tumor growth and treatment response.</span>

A new div FOSLS mixed finite element method is proposed and analyzed for the first-order system of the general second-order elliptic problems in terms of the scalar variable displacement and the vectorial variable flux. The main feature of the proposed method is to apply a local constant element or (bi,tri)linear element

The method is coercive and symmetric, allowing any combination of conforming approximations for both scalar and vectorial variables. More importantly, the method is suitable for general nonaffine quadrilateral Raviart–Thomas (RT) and nonaffine hexahedral Raviart–Thomas–Nédélec (RTN)

We study dynamics of a generic quadratic diffeomorphism, a 3D generalization of the planar Hénon map. Focusing on the dissipative, orientation preserving case, we give a comprehensive parameter study of codimension-one and two bifurcations. Periodic orbits, born at resonant, Neimark–Sacker bifurcations, give rise to Arnold tongues in parameter space. Aperiodic attractors include invariant circles and chaotic orbits; these are distinguished by rotation number and Lyapunov exponents. Chaotic orbits include Hénon-like and Lorenz-like attractors, which can arise from period-doubling cascades, and those born from the destruction of invariant circles. The latter lie on paraboloids near the local unstable manifold of a fixed point.</span>

Change point detection (CPD) for multi-agent systems helps one to evaluate the state and better control the system. Multivariate CPD methods solve the [math] time series well; however, the multi-agent systems often produce the [math] dimensional data, where [math] is the dimension of multivariate observations, [math] is the total observation time, and [math] is the number of agents. In this paper, we propose two valid approaches based on higher-order features, namely, the Betti number feature extraction and the Persistence feature extraction, to compress the [math]-dimensional features into one dimension so that general CPD methods can be applied to higher-dimensional data. First, a topological structure based on the Vietoris–Rips complex is constructed on each time-slice snapshot. Then, the Betti number and persistence of the topological structures are obtained to separately constitute two feature matrices for change point estimates. Higher-order features primarily describe the data distribution on each snapshot and are, therefore, independent of the node correspondence cross snapshots, which gives our methods unique advantages in processing missing data. Experiments in multi-agent systems demonstrate the significant performance of our methods. We believe that our methods not only provide a new tool for dimensionality reduction and missing data in multi-agent systems but also have the potential to be applied to a wider range of fields, such as complex networks.</span>

This paper investigates partial topology identification of simplicial complexes based on adaptive synchronization. For the nodes of interest, the interactions that they participate in can be accurately reconstructed by designing adaptive controllers and parameter estimators. Particularly, not only pairwise interactions but a higher-order structure can be effectively recovered by our method. Moreover, a new linear independence condition with a rigorous definition is established for parameter estimators to converge asymptotically to the true values. Numerical simulations on a general two-dimensional simplicial complex as well as a real-world structure are provided to show the validity of the result and discuss the influence of different parameters on the identification process.</span>

Within the framework of p-adaptive flux reconstruction, we aim to construct efficient polynomial multigrid (pMG) preconditioners for implicit time integration of the Navier–Stokes equations using Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov (JFNK) methods. We hypothesise that in pseudo transient continuation (PTC), as the residual drops, the frequency of error modes that dictates the convergence rate gets higher and higher. We apply nonlinear pMG solvers to stiff steady problems at low Mach number (

                              <span>Abstract
A time-continuous (tc-)embedding method is first proposed for solving nonlinear scalar hyperbolic conservation laws with discontinuous solutions (shocks and rarefaction waves) on codimension 1, connected, smooth, and closed manifolds (surface PDEs or SPDEs in 
                      
                      \({\mathbb {R}}^2\)
                      
                     and 
                      
                      \({\mathbb {R}}^3\)
                      
                    ). The new embedding method improves upon the classical closest point (cp-)embedding method, which requires re-establishments of the constant-along-normal (CAN-)property of the extension function at every time step, in terms of accuracy and efficiency, by incorporating the CAN-property analytically and explicitly in the embedding equation. The tc-embedding SPDEs are solved by the second-order nonlinear central finite volume scheme with a nonlinear minmod slope limiter in space, and the third-order total variation diminished Runge-Kutta scheme in time. An adaptive nonlinear essentially non-oscillatory polynomial interpolation is used to obtain the solution values at the ghost cells. Numerical results in solving the linear wave equation and the Burgers’ equation show that the proposed tc-embedding method has better accuracy, improved resolution, and reduced CPU times than the classical cp-embedding method. The Burgers’ equation, the traffic flow problem, and the Buckley-Leverett equation are solved to demonstrate the robust performance of the tc-embedding method in resolving fine-scale structures efficiently even in the presence of a shock and the essentially non-oscillatory capturing of shocks and rarefaction waves on simple and complex shaped one-dimensional manifolds. Burgers’ equation is also solved on the two-dimensional torus-shaped and spherical-shaped manifolds.</span>

In this work we study the solution of the Riemann problem for the barotropic version of the conservative symmetric hyperbolic and thermodynamically compatible (SHTC) two-phase flow model introduced in Romenski et al. (J Sci Comput 42(1):68, 2009, Quart Appl Math 65(2):259–279, 2007). All characteristic fields are carefully studied and explicit expressions are derived for the Riemann invariants and the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions. Due to the presence of multiple characteristics in the system under consideration, non-standard wave phenomena can occur. Therefore we briefly review admissibility conditions for discontinuities and then discuss possible wave interactions. In particular we will show that overlapping rarefaction waves are possible and moreover we may have shocks that lie inside a rarefaction wave. In contrast to nonconservative two phase flow models, such as the Baer–Nunziato system, we can use the advantage of the conservative form of the model under consideration. Furthermore, we show the relation between the considered conservative SHTC system and the corresponding barotropic version of the nonconservative Baer–Nunziato model. Additionally, we derive the reduced four equation Kapila system for the case of instantaneous relaxation, which is the common limit system of both, the conservative SHTC model and the non-conservative Baer–Nunziato model. Finally, we compare exact solutions of the Riemann problem with numerical results obtained for the conservative two-phase flow model under consideration, for the non-conservative Baer–Nunziato system and for the Kapila limit. The examples underline the previous analysis of the different wave phenomena, as well as differences and similarities of the three systems.</span>

Summation-By-Parts (SBP) methods provide a systematic way of constructing provably stable numerical schemes. However, many proofs of convergence and accuracy rely on the assumption that the SBP operator possesses a particular eigenvalue property. In this note, three results pertaining to this property are proven. Firstly, the eigenvalue property does not hold for all nullspace consistent SBP operators. Secondly, this issue can be addressed without affecting the accuracy of the method by adding a specially designed, arbitrarily small perturbation term to the SBP operator. Thirdly, all pseudospectral methods satisfy the eigenvalue property.</span>

Implementing deep neural networks for learning the solution maps of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) turns out to be more efficient than using many conventional numerical methods. However, limited theoretical analyses have been conducted on this approach. In this study, we investigate the expressive power of deep rectified quadratic unit (ReQU) neural networks for approximating the solution maps of parametric PDEs. The proposed approach is motivated by the recent important work of Kutyniok et al. (Constr Approx 1–53, 2021), which uses deep rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks for solving parametric PDEs. In contrast to the previously established complexity-bound 
                      
                      \(\mathcal {O}\left( d^3\log _{2}^{q}(1/ \epsilon ) \right) \)
                      
                     for ReLU neural networks, we derive an upper bound 
                      
                      \(\mathcal {O}\left( d^3\log _{2}^{q}\log _{2}(1/ \epsilon ) \right) \)
                      
                     on the size of the deep ReQU neural network required to achieve accuracy 
                      
                      \(\epsilon &gt;0\)
                      
                    , where d is the dimension of reduced basis representing the solutions. Our method takes full advantage of the inherent low-dimensionality of the solution manifolds and better approximation performance of deep ReQU neural networks. Numerical experiments are performed to verify our theoretical result.</span>

This paper studies the sliding mode control method for coupled delayed fractional reaction-diffusion Cohen–Grossberg neural networks on a directed non-strongly connected topology. A novel fractional integral sliding mode surface and the corresponding control law are designed to realize global Mittag-Leffler synchronization. The sufficient conditions for synchronization and reachability of the sliding mode surface are derived via the hierarchical method and the Lyapunov method. Finally, simulations are provided to verify our theoretical findings.</span>

Populations of globally coupled phase oscillators are described in the thermodynamic limit by kinetic equations for the distribution densities or, equivalently, by infinite hierarchies of equations for the order parameters. Ott and Antonsen [Chaos 18, 037113 (2008)] have found an invariant finite-dimensional subspace on which the dynamics is described by one complex variable per population. For oscillators with Cauchy distributed frequencies or for those driven by Cauchy white noise, this subspace is weakly stable and, thus, describes the asymptotic dynamics. Here, we report on an exact finite-dimensional reduction of the dynamics outside of the Ott–Antonsen subspace. We show that the evolution from generic initial states can be reduced to that of three complex variables, plus a constant function. For identical noise-free oscillators, this reduction corresponds to the Watanabe–Strogatz system of equations [Watanabe and Strogatz, Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 2391 (1993)]. We discuss how the reduced system can be used to explore the transient dynamics of perturbed ensembles.</span>

Different from the linear counterpart, elastic wave propagation in nonlinear elastic metamaterials with damping (EMD) systems has much more novel behaviors. It is little work that reveals the nonlinear wave propagation mechanism in the nonlinear EMD in the literature. In this paper, nonlinear EMD systems with different configurations for the nonlinear elements are constructed to study the nonlinear wave propagation characteristics based on the analytical formulation. Nonlinear wave propagation attenuation characteristics in nonlinear EMD systems are studied in the frequency-domain. Spectro-spatial characteristics of nonlinear traveling wave packet in space- and time-domain are also analyzed to reveal space frequency-domain characteristics. Influences of different configurations for the nonlinear elements on wave propagation in nonlinear EMD systems are discussed. Results shown that locations of band structures can be tuned by changing intensities of nonlinearities in the nonlinear EMD systems, which are not found in the linear system. Moreover, different configurations for the nonlinear elements can lead to localization feature emerged in a nonlinear EMD system, which indicates solitary waves causing from the interaction between dispersion and nonlinearity exist in the nonlinear systems. This interesting wave propagating properties can be used to design new devices for acoustic switches, energy harvesting, and broadband vibration control.</span>

Systems of nonlinear chemical oscillators can exhibit a large diversity of non-trivial states depending on the parameters that characterize them. Among these, a synchronization phenomenon is of special interest due to its direct link with chemical and biological processes in nature. We carry out numerical experiments for two different sets of chemical oscillators with different properties and immersed in a Belousov–Zhabotinsky solution. We document the emergence of different states of synchronization that depend on the parameters characterizing the solution. We also show that, in the interface regions, this system generates a stable dynamics of intermittency between the different synchronization states where interesting phenomena, such as the “devil&#x27;s staircase,” emerge. In general, the added complexity introduced with the additional set of oscillators results in more complex non-trivial synchronization states.</span>

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder with recurrent seizures, which convey complex dynamical characteristics including chaos and randomness. Until now, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated, especially the bistable property beneath the epileptic random induction phenomena in certain conditions. Inspired by the recent finding that astrocyte GTPase-activating protein (G-protein)-coupled receptors could be involved in stochastic epileptic seizures, we proposed a neuron–astrocyte network model, incorporating the noise of the astrocytic second messenger, inositol triphosphate (IP3) that is modulated by G-protein-coupled receptor activation. Based on this model, we have statistically analyzed the transitions of epileptic seizures by performing repeatable simulation trials. Our simulation results show that the increase in the IP3 noise intensity induces depolarization-block epileptic seizures together with an increase in neuronal firing frequency, consistent with corresponding experiments. Meanwhile, the bistable states of the seizure dynamics were present under certain noise intensities, during which the neuronal firing pattern switches between regular sparse spiking and epileptic seizure states. This random presence of epileptic seizures is absent when the noise intensity continues to increase, accompanying with an increase in the epileptic depolarization block duration. The simulation results also shed light on the fact that calcium signals in astrocytes play significant roles in the pattern formations of the epileptic seizure. Our results provide a potential pathway for understanding the epileptic randomness in certain conditions.</span>

As seen by an observer in the rotating frame, the earth’s small spheroidal deformations neutralize the centrifugal force, leaving only the smaller Coriolis force to govern the “inertial” motion of objects that move on its surface, assumed smooth and frictionless. Previous studies of inertial motion employ weakly spheroidal equations of motion that ignore the influence of the centrifugal force and yet treat the earth as a sphere. The latitude dependence of these equations renders them strongly nonlinear. We derive and justify these equations and use them to identify, classify, name, describe, and illustrate all possible classes of inertial motion, including a new class of motion called circumpolar waves, which encircle both poles during each cycle of the motion. We illustrate these classes using CorioVis, our freely available Coriolis visualization software. We identify a rotational/time-reversal symmetry for motion on the earth’s surface and use this symmetry to develop and validate closed-form small-amplitude approximations for the four main classes and one degenerate class of inertial motion. For these five classes, we supply calculations of experimentally relevant frequencies, zonal drifts, and latitude ranges.</span>

In this paper, we present a finite difference Heterogeneous Multiscale Method for the Landau–Lifshitz equation with a highly oscillatory diffusion coefficient. The approach combines a higher order discretization and artificial damping in the so-called micro problem to obtain an efficient implementation. The influence of different parameters on the resulting approximation error is discussed. Further important factors that are taken into account are the choice of time integrator and the initial data for the micro problem which has to be set appropriately to get a consistent scheme. Numerical examples in one and two space dimensions and for both periodic as well as more general coefficients are given to demonstrate the functionality of the approach.</span>

The saddle point (SP) calculation is a grand challenge for computationally intensive energy function in computational chemistry area, where the saddle point may represent the transition state. The traditional methods need to evaluate the gradients of the energy function at a very large number of locations. To reduce the number of expensive computations of the true gradients, we propose an active learning framework consisting of a statistical surrogate model, Gaussian process regression (GPR) for the energy function, and a single-walker dynamics method, gentle accent dynamics (GAD), for the saddle-type transition states. SP is detected by the GAD applied to the GPR surrogate for the gradient vector and the Hessian matrix. Our key ingredient for efficiency improvements is an active learning method which sequentially designs the most informative locations and takes evaluations of the original model at these locations to train GPR. We formulate this active learning task as the optimal experimental design problem and propose a very efficient sample-based sub-optimal criterion to construct the optimal locations. We show that the new method significantly decreases the required number of energy or force evaluations of the original model.</span>

Models of coupled oscillator networks play an important role in describing collective synchronization dynamics in biological and technological systems. The Kuramoto model describes oscillator’s phase evolution and explains the transition from incoherent to coherent oscillations under simplifying assumptions, including all-to-all coupling with uniform strength. Real world networks, however, often display heterogeneous connectivity and coupling weights that influence the critical threshold for this transition. We formulate a general mean-field theory (Vlasov–Focker Planck equation) for stochastic Kuramoto-type phase oscillator models, valid for coupling graphs/networks with heterogeneous connectivity and coupling strengths, using graphop theory in the mean-field limit. Considering symmetric odd-valued coupling functions, we mathematically prove an exact formula for the critical threshold for the incoherence–coherence transition. We numerically test the predicted threshold using large finite-size representations of the network model. For a large class of graph models, we find that the numerical tests agree very well with the predicted threshold obtained from mean-field theory. However, the prediction is more difficult in practice for graph structures that are sufficiently sparse. Our findings open future research avenues toward a deeper understanding of mean-field theories for heterogeneous systems.</span>

This research studies information properties, such as complexity and disequilibrium, in the dipole-type Hamiltonian mean-field model. A fundamental analytical assessment is the partition function in the canonical ensemble to derive statistical, thermodynamical, and information measures. They are also analytical, dependent on the number of particles, consistent with the theory for high temperatures, and rising some limitations at shallow temperatures, giving us a notion of the classicality of the system defining an interval of temperatures where the model is well working.</span>

The ultimate purpose of the statistical analysis of ordinal patterns is to characterize the distribution of the features they induce. In particular, knowing the joint distribution of the pair entropy-statistical complexity for a large class of time series models would allow statistical tests that are unavailable to date. Working in this direction, we characterize the asymptotic distribution of the empirical Shannon’s entropy for any model under which the true normalized entropy is neither zero nor one. We obtain the asymptotic distribution from the central limit theorem (assuming large time series), the multivariate delta method, and a third-order correction of its mean value. We discuss the applicability of other results (exact, first-, and second-order corrections) regarding their accuracy and numerical stability. Within a general framework for building test statistics about Shannon’s entropy, we present a bilateral test that verifies if there is enough evidence to reject the hypothesis that two signals produce ordinal patterns with the same Shannon’s entropy. We applied this bilateral test to the daily maximum temperature time series from three cities (Dublin, Edinburgh, and Miami) and obtained sensible results.</span>

A vast body of experiments share the view that social norms are major factors for the emergence of fairness in a population of individuals playing the dictator game (DG). Recently, to explore which social norms are conducive to sustaining cooperation has obtained considerable concern. However, thus, far few studies have investigated how social norms influence the evolution of fairness by means of indirect reciprocity. In this study, we propose an indirect reciprocal model of the DG and consider that an individual can be assigned as the dictator due to its good reputation. We investigate the “leading eight” norms and all second-order social norms by a two-timescale theoretical analysis. We show that when role assignment is based on reputation, four of the “leading eight” norms, including stern judging and simple standing, lead to a high level of fairness, which increases with the selection intensity. Our work also reveals that not only the correct treatment of making a fair split with good recipients but also distinguishing unjustified unfair split from justified unfair split matters in elevating the level of fairness.</span>

We consider several topologies of power grids and analyze how the addition of transmission lines affects their dynamics. The main example we are dealing with is a power grid that has a tree-like three-element motif at the periphery. We establish conditions where the addition of a transmission line in the motif enhances its stability or induces Braess’s paradox and reduces stability of the entire grid. By using bifurcation theory and nonlocal stability analysis, we show that two scenarios for Braess’s paradox are realized in the grid. The first scenario is well described and is associated with the disappearance of the synchronous mode. The second scenario has not been previously described and is associated with the reduction of nonlocal stability of the synchronous mode due to the appearance of asynchronous modes. The necessary conditions for stable operation of the grid, under the addition of a line, are derived. It is proved that the new scenario for Braess’s paradox is realized in the grids with more complex topologies even when several lines are added in their bulks.</span>

The way of information diffusion among individuals can be quite complicated, and it is not only limited to one type of communication, but also impacted by multiple channels. Meanwhile, it is easier for an agent to accept an idea once the proportion of their friends who take it goes beyond a specific threshold. Furthermore, in social networks, some higher-order structures, such as simplicial complexes and hypergraph, can describe more abundant and realistic phenomena. Therefore, based on the classical multiplex network model coupling the infectious disease with its relevant information, we propose a novel epidemic model, in which the lower layer represents the physical contact network depicting the epidemic dissemination, while the upper layer stands for the online social network picturing the diffusion of information. In particular, the upper layer is generated by random simplicial complexes, among which the herd-like threshold model is adopted to characterize the information diffusion, and the unaware–aware–unaware model is also considered simultaneously. Using the microscopic Markov chain approach, we analyze the epidemic threshold of the proposed epidemic model and further check the results with numerous Monte Carlo simulations. It is discovered that the threshold model based on the random simplicial complexes network may still cause abrupt transitions on the epidemic threshold. It is also found that simplicial complexes may greatly influence the epidemic size at a steady state.</span>

We study the spreading of renewable power fluctuations through grids with Ohmic losses on the lines. By formulating a network-adapted linear response theory, we find that vulnerability patterns are linked to the left Laplacian eigenvectors of the overdamped eigenmodes. We show that for tree-like networks, fluctuations are amplified in the opposite direction of the power flow. This novel mechanism explains vulnerability patterns that were observed in previous numerical simulations of renewable microgrids. While exact mathematical derivations are only possible for tree-like networks with a homogeneous response, we show that the mechanisms discovered also explain vulnerability patterns in realistic heterogeneous meshed grids by studying the IEEE RTS-1996 test system.</span>

In this paper, analytical predictions of the firing cascades formed by stable and unstable firings in a Hindmarsh–Rose (HR) neuron system are completed via an implicit mapping method. The semi-analytical firing cascades present the route from periodic firings to chaos. For such cascades, the continuous firing flow of the nonlinear neuron system is discretized to form a special mapping structure for nonlinear firing activities. Stability and bifurcation analysis of the nonlinear firings are performed based on resultant eigenvalues of the global mapping structures. Stable and unstable firing solutions in the bifurcation tree exhibit clear period-doubling firing cascades toward chaos. Bifurcations are predicted accurately on the connections. Phase bifurcation trees are observed, which provide deep cognitions of neuronal firings. Harmonic dynamics of the period-doubling firing cascades are obtained and discussed for a better understanding of the contribution of the harmonics in frequency domains. The route into chaos is illustrated by the firing chains from period-1 to period-16 firings and verified by numerical solutions. The applied methods and obtained results provide new perspectives to the complex firing dynamics of the HR neuron system and present a potential strategy to regulate the firings of neurons.</span>

To facilitate the analysis of pattern formation and the related phase transitions in Bose–Einstein condensates, we present an explicit approximate mapping from the nonlocal Gross–Pitaevskii equation with cubic nonlinearity to a phase field crystal (PFC) model. This approximation is valid close to the superfluid–supersolid phase transition boundary. The simplified PFC model permits the exploration of bifurcations and phase transitions via numerical path continuation employing standard software. While revealing the detailed structure of the bifurcations present in the system, we demonstrate the existence of localized states in the PFC approximation. Finally, we discuss how higher-order nonlinearities change the structure of the bifurcation diagram representing the transitions found in the system.</span>

In this paper, we study the network pinning control problem in the presence of two different types of coupling: (i) node-to-node coupling among the network nodes and (ii) input-to-node coupling from the source node to the “pinned nodes.” Previous work has mainly focused on the case that (i) and (ii) are of the same type. We decouple the stability analysis of the target synchronous solution into subproblems of the lowest dimension by using the techniques of simultaneous block diagonalization of matrices. Interestingly, we obtain two different types of blocks, driven and undriven. The overall dimension of the driven blocks is equal to the dimension of an appropriately defined controllable subspace, while all the remaining undriven blocks are scalar. Our main result is a decomposition of the stability problem into four independent sets of equations, which we call quotient controllable, quotient uncontrollable, redundant controllable, and redundant uncontrollable. Our analysis shows that the number and location of the pinned nodes affect the number and the dimension of each set of equations. We also observe that in a large variety of complex networks, the stability of the target synchronous solution is de facto only determined by a single quotient controllable block.</span>

Confronted with the biological problem of managing plasticity in cell populations, which is in particular responsible for transient and reversible drug resistance in cancer, we propose a rationale consisting of an integro-differential and a reaction-advection-diffusion equation, the properties of which are studied theoretically and numerically. By using a constructive finite volume method, we show the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution and illustrate by numerical approximations and their simulations the capacity of the model to exhibit divergence of traits. This feature may be theoretically interpreted as describing a physiological step towards multicellularity in animal evolution and, closer to present-day clinical challenges in oncology, as a possible representation of bet hedging in cancer cell populations.</span>

We revisit the problem of diffusion in a driven system consisting of an inertial Brownian particle moving in a symmetric periodic potential and subjected to a symmetric time-periodic force. We reveal parameter domains in which diffusion is normal in the long time limit and exhibits intriguing giant damped quasiperiodic oscillations as a function of the external driving amplitude. As the mechanism behind this effect, we identify the corresponding oscillations of difference in the number of locked and running trajectories that carry the leading contribution to the diffusion coefficient. Our findings can be verified experimentally in a multitude of physical systems, including colloidal particles, Josephson junction, or cold atoms dwelling in optical lattices, to name only a few.</span>

We evaluate Schelling’s segregation outcomes from the square lattice, regular random networks, and clustered regular random networks by situating them in the probability distribution of the entire outcome space of satisfaction and segregation. To do so, we employ the Wang–Landau algorithm and calculate the entropy and the number of states as a function of satisfaction and segregation. According to the results, satisfaction tends to increase with segregation, irrespective of the network structure. Moreover, segregation occurs almost surely when satisfaction is maximized, which we also algebraically derive and confirm on infinite-size networks. The average ratios of the neighbors of the same tag are about 67% for the square lattice and regular random networks and about 73% for clustered regular random networks with a clustering coefficient of 0.37(1). Thus, clustering increases segregation on regular random networks. Further, we find that Schelling’s path-dependent process generates sharper segregation than expected by random configurations, an outcome symptomatic of over-optimization from the social welfare perspective. Adopting an alternative rule restricting individuals’ choice set may reduce segregation without compromising on satisfaction.</span>

Convective dissolution can occur in porous media when a given solute dissolves in a host layer from above and increases the density of the host solution. Buoyancy-driven fingering can then develop, which increases the transfer flux of the solute. We investigate here numerically the properties of this convective dissolution when the porous host layer is inclined by an angle [math] relative to the horizontal direction. We consider an incompressible flow in porous media governed by Darcy’s law, driven by density gradients associated with the concentration of the dissolving solute. The model problem focuses on the case of a very long (infinite) tilted porous layer limited by two parallel impermeable surfaces. A linear stability analysis and nonlinear simulations are performed using the Boussinesq approximation. A vorticity-stream function formulation is adopted to solve the two-dimensional hydrodynamic field through the finite element method. We find that the inclination of the interface decreases the growth rate of the instability and the range of unstable wavenumbers, delaying or even suppressing the onset of the fingering instability. Moreover, it introduces a drift velocity on the perturbations, which is characterized here in both the linear stability analysis and the nonlinear simulations.</span>

The complex, highly nonlinear dynamic behavior of nuclear reactors can be captured qualitatively by novel four-dimensional (that is, fourth order) and three-dimensional (that is, third order) models of chaotic systems and analyzed with Lyapunov spectra, bifurcation diagrams, and phase diagrams. The chaotic systems exhibit a rich variety of bifurcation phenomena, including the periodic-doubling route to chaos, reverse bifurcations, anti-monotonicity, and merging chaos. The offset boosting method, which relocates the attractor’s basin of attraction in any direction, is demonstrated in these chaotic systems. Both constant parameters and periodic functions are seen in offset boosting phenomena, yielding chaotic attractors with controlled mean values and coexisting attractors.</span>

Our increasing dependence on infrastructure networks leads to growing concerns over the protection of these networks. Many methods have been proposed to select protective strategies by combining complex network theory and game theory. However, the misleading effect of hidden links is not considered in previous methods. This work creates an information gap between attackers and defenders by partly hiding network links to mislead the attacker in the game. We first introduce the rule of link hiding that depends on the nodes’ property, where the number of hidden links has a maximum value. Additionally, based on the Stackelberg game model, we establish an attack–defense game model with link hiding strategies considering node property and cost constraints. Finally, we conduct experiments in a scale-free network and an existing power grid. The experimental results show that the defender tends to combine first-mover advantage and link hiding to get a better payoff under more different costs of the nodes. Hiding half of the links in the existing power grid can effectively reduce network damage by about [math]% on average, with the two sides investing the same resources. The effect of link hiding could be more obvious when the attacker owns more resources than the defender. When an attacker employs the high-degree attacking strategy, the proposed link hiding method can help the defender reduce the damage to the network by 12.2% compared to the link reconnecting method.</span>

One approach to understand the chaotic dynamics of nonlinear dissipative systems is the study of non-chaotic yet dynamically unstable invariant solutions embedded in the system’s chaotic attractor. The significance of zero-dimensional unstable fixed points and one-dimensional unstable periodic orbits capturing time-periodic dynamics is widely accepted for high-dimensional chaotic systems, including fluid turbulence, while higher-dimensional invariant tori representing quasiperiodic dynamics have rarely been considered. We demonstrate that unstable 2-tori are generically embedded in the hyperchaotic attractor of a dissipative system of ordinary differential equations; tori can be numerically identified via bifurcations of unstable periodic orbits and their parameteric continuation and characterization of stability properties are feasible. As higher-dimensional tori are expected to be structurally unstable, 2-tori together with periodic orbits and equilibria form a complete set of relevant invariant solutions on which to base a dynamical description of chaos.</span>

Reservoir computing is a machine learning approach that can generate a surrogate model of a dynamical system. It can learn the underlying dynamical system using fewer trainable parameters and, hence, smaller training data sets than competing approaches. Recently, a simpler formulation, known as next-generation reservoir computing, removed many algorithm metaparameters and identified a well-performing traditional reservoir computer, thus simplifying training even further. Here, we study a particularly challenging problem of learning a dynamical system that has both disparate time scales and multiple co-existing dynamical states (attractors). We compare the next-generation and traditional reservoir computer using metrics quantifying the geometry of the ground-truth and forecasted attractors. For the studied four-dimensional system, the next-generation reservoir computing approach uses [math] less training data, requires [math] shorter “warmup” time, has fewer metaparameters, and has an [math] higher accuracy in predicting the co-existing attractor characteristics in comparison to a traditional reservoir computer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it predicts the basin of attraction with high accuracy. This work lends further support to the superior learning ability of this new machine learning algorithm for dynamical systems.</span>

This is a review of group entropy and its application to permutation complexity. Specifically, we revisit a new approach to the notion of complexity in the time series analysis based on both permutation entropy and group entropy. As a result, the permutation entropy rate can be extended from deterministic dynamics to random processes. More generally, our approach provides a unified framework to discuss chaotic and random behaviors.</span>

The low-frequency variability of the extratropical atmosphere involves hemispheric-scale recurring, often persistent, states known as teleconnection patterns or regimes, which can have a profound impact on predictability on intra-seasonal and longer timescales. However, reliable data-driven identification and dynamical representation of such states are still challenging problems in modeling the dynamics of the atmosphere. We present a new method, which allows us both to detect recurring regimes of atmospheric variability and to obtain dynamical variables serving as an embedding for these regimes. The method combines two approaches from nonlinear data analysis: partitioning a network of recurrent states with studying its properties by the recurrence quantification analysis and the kernel principal component analysis. We apply the method to study teleconnection patterns in a quasi-geostrophical model of atmospheric circulation over the extratropical hemisphere as well as to reanalysis data of geopotential height anomalies in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere atmosphere in the winter seasons from 1981 to the present. It is shown that the detected regimes as well as the obtained set of dynamical variables explain large-scale weather patterns, which are associated, in particular, with severe winters over Eurasia and North America. The method presented opens prospects for improving empirical modeling and long-term forecasting of large-scale atmospheric circulation regimes.</span>

We study the fractional maps of complex order, [math], for [math] and [math] in one and two dimensions. In two dimensions, we study Hénon, Duffing, and Lozi maps, and in [math], we study logistic, tent, Gauss, circle, and Bernoulli maps. The generalization in [math] can be done in two different ways, which are not equivalent for fractional order and lead to different bifurcation diagrams. We observed that the smooth maps, such as logistic, Gauss, Duffing, and Hénon maps, do not show chaos, while discontinuous maps, such as Bernoulli and circle maps,show chaos. The tent and Lozi map are continuous but not differentiable, and they show chaos as well. In [math], we find that the complex fractional-order maps that show chaos also show multistability. Thus, it can be inferred that the smooth maps of complex fractional order tend to show more regular behavior than the discontinuous or non-differentiable maps.</span>

This paper reports the first finding of cupolets in a chaotic Hindmarsh–Rose neural model. Cupolets (chaotic, unstable, periodic, orbit-lets) are unstable periodic orbits that have been stabilized through a particular control scheme by applying a binary control sequence. We demonstrate different neural dynamics (periodic or chaotic) of the Hindmarsh–Rose model through a bifurcation diagram where the external input current, [math], is the bifurcation parameter. We select a region in the chaotic parameter space and provide the results of numerical simulations. In this chosen parameter space, a control scheme is applied when the trajectory intersects with either of the two control planes. The type of the control is determined by a bit in a binary control sequence. The control is either a small microcontrol (0) or a large macrocontrol (1) that adjusts the future dynamics of the trajectory by a perturbation determined by the coding function [math]. We report the discovery of many cupolets with corresponding control sequences and comment on the differences with previously reported cupolets in the double scroll system. We provide some examples of the generated cupolets and conclude by discussing potential implications for biological neurons.</span>

 Abstract. Data-driven stochastic parameterization methods use observational data to support and improve existing prediction systems. Specifically in atmospheric sciences, uncertainty in observations is a challenge for modeling because several aspects of the physical processes are yet to be understood in some contexts. A key goal in constructing atmospheric models is to express unresolved processes using the resolved variables of a prediction system. Estimating parameterisations for highly nonlinear systems with non stationary data requires application-specific tools. Previous work on methods for analyzing nonstationary data presents a flexible model-based nonparametric clustering methodology that can be exploited for parameterization development. This paper adapts the existing framework for stochastic parameterization by combining the continuous-time formulation of stochastic differential equations (SDE) with the clustering method. We use a closed-form likelihood function approach based on a suitable Hermite expansion to approximate the parameter values of the SDE with arbitrary nonlinear drift and nonlinear diffusion. The novel parameterization framework provides a smooth classification function that allows us to recover the underlying temporal parameter modulation of a nonstationary one-dimensional SDE. The numerical examples show that the clustering approach recovers a hidden functional relationship between the parameters of the SDE model and an additional auxiliary process. The study builds upon this functional relationship to develop closed-form, nonstationary, data-driven stochastic models for multiscale dynamical systems in real-world applications.</span>

This paper applies new and recently introduced approaches to study trends in gun violence in the United States. We use techniques in both the time and frequency domain to provide a more complete understanding of gun violence dynamics. We analyze gun violence incidents on a state-by-state basis as recorded by the Gun Violence Archive. We have numerous specific phenomena of focus, including periodicity of incidents, locations in time where behavioral changes occur, and shifts in gun violence patterns since April 2020. First, we implement a recently introduced method of spectral density estimation for nonstationary time series to investigate periodicity on a state-by-state basis, including revealing where periodic behaviors change with time. We can also classify different patterns of behavioral changes among the states. We then aim to understand the most significant shifts in gun violence since numerous key events in 2020, including the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns, and periods of civil unrest. Our dual-domain analysis provides a more thorough understanding and challenges numerous widely held conceptions regarding the prevalence of gun violence incidents.</span>
